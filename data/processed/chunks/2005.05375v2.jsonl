The computed pair distribution function of the novel Cm–Cu3P11 phase shows its structural similarity to the experimentally identiﬁed Cm–Cu2P7 phase. The relative stability of all Cu–P phases at ﬁnite tem- peratures is determined by calculating the Gibbs free energy using vibrational eﬀects from phonon modes at 0 K. From this, a ﬁnite-temperature convex hull is created, on which Fm¯3m–Cu2P is dynamically stable and the Cu3−xP (x < 1) defect phase Cmc21–Cu8P3 remains metastable (within 20 meV/atom of the convex hull) across a temperature range from 0 K to 600 K.

Cu2P is also predicted to be both non-magnetic and metallic, which should promote eﬃcient electron transfer in the anode. Cu2P’s favorable properties as a metallic, high- capacity material suggest its use as a future conversion anode for Li-ion batteries; with a volume expansion of 99 % during complete cycling, Cu2P anodes could be more durable than other conversion anodes in the Cu–P system with volume expansions greater than 150 %. The structures and ﬁgures presented in this paper, and the code used to generate them, can be interactively explored online using Binder. Introduction Graphite is the most commonly employed lithium-ion battery (LIB) anode, but is inherently limited by a maximum theoretical capacity of 372 mAh/g upon formation of LiC6. Phos- phorus (black or red) has a signiﬁcantly higher theoretical capacity of 2596 mAh/g due to the formation of Li3P; however it suﬀers from capacity deterioration, primarily caused by deleterious volume expansion that occurs upon charging, which constrains the capacity to 350–500 mAh/g in a limited voltage window.1 In addition, P and its lithiated phases have limited electrical conductivity, requiring dopants and additives to improve performance. By adding transition metals to P, through nanostructuring or synthesis, both electrical conduc- tivity and stability during cycling can be enhanced.2 Transition metal phosphides (TMP) provide a large design space in which to engineer such high-capacity, conversion anodes for LIBs.3 High-throughput computational screen- ing has previously identiﬁed TMPs with high capacities for LIB electrodes including TiP, Co2P, Mn2P and others.4 As conversion anodes for LIBs, TMPs oﬀer both added gravimetric capacity (ranging from 500 to 2000 mAh/g4) and stability against volume expansion over several battery cycles.5 In addition to bulk or powdered TMPs being used as LIB conversion anodes,6 nanostructured TMPs can often display improved electrochemical cycling perfor- mance.7 Despite these eﬀorts, TMPs have yet to be widely adopted as conversion anodes, 2", "page": 1, "position": 0}

Despite this drawback in volume expansion, TMPs show higher average voltages than graphite, which has an average voltage of 0.1 V. For exam- ple, CoP has an average voltage of 0.67 V, the ternary metal phosphide LiFeP has an average voltage of 0.4 V, and MnP has an average voltage of 0.62 V.4 Higher average voltages give the metal phosphides improved safety while sacriﬁcing energy density, making them an ideal choice for large-scale and long-term energy storage. Several previously studied TMP anodes include FePx=1,2,4,8 Fe2P nanoparticles,9 Ni2P,10 CuP2,11,12 and Cu3P,13,14 among others. Of the TMPs tested as conversion anodes, the cop- per phosphides (speciﬁcally CuP2 and Cu3P) have shown promise for their cyclability and capacity. The copper phosphides oﬀer additional beneﬁts to the other TMPs, as Cu is al- ready used as a common current collector, providing further cycling capability and resistance to degradation.15 Cu3P prepared by high temperature synthesis had a ﬁrst-cycle capacity of 527 mAh/g,13 and a porous Cu3P anode synthesized by facile chemical corrosion exhib- ited a capacity between 360–380 mAh/g over 70 cycles.16 The capacity of high temperature synthesized Cu3P exceeds that of graphite, and the cyclability of porous Cu3P is improved relative to other Cu3P anodes.13,17 CuP2 on the other hand, delivers a higher initial ca- pacity of 815 mAh/g, but can only be cycled stably 10 times before the capacity fades to 360 mAh/g.12 The main factor in this degradation is the high concentration of P in the CuP2 which, while enabling high capacity, also contributes to the structural instability of CuP2 during cycling as the lithium-rich Li3P phase forms. To optimize the trade-oﬀbetween sta- bility and capacity, it would be beneﬁcial to discover a compound with higher P content than Cu3P to oﬀer higher capacity, and with a Cu content higher than CuP2 to aid in cyclability.

Two other phases, Cm–Cu3P11 and I¯43d–Cu3P are identiﬁed as metastable, both bearing structural similarity to known copper phosphides. We calculate the convex hull of Cu–P at temperatures up to 600 K, conﬁrming the dynamic and chemical stability of Cu2P across this temperature range. A ground-state voltage proﬁle from density-functional theory (DFT), shows that Fm¯3m– Cu2P undergoes the same lithiation process as P63cm–Cu3P; however Fm¯3m–Cu2P has a higher capacity of 508 mAh/g, with an average voltage of 0.86 V versus Li/Li+ (compared to 0.91 V for P63cm–Cu3P). Methods To search for novel copper phosphides, we ﬁrst performed structural relaxations of the 13 structures from the Inorganic Crystal Structure Database (ICSD)28 of CuxP (0 < x < 1). The Python package matador21 was used to query 1053 prototype binary structures from the Open Quantum Materials Database (OQMD)19 with chemical compositions containing a pnictogen and a transition metal from the ﬁrst two rows, namely {Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Zr, Nb, Mo, Tc, Ru, Rh, Pd, Ag, Cd}–{P, As, Sb}; each composition was 4", "page": 3, "position": 0}

In order to extend this search beyond existing prototypes, two additional structure prediction steps were performed, namely AIRSS29 and an evolutionary search with the GA implemented in the ilustrado22 package. When performing AIRSS, one proceeds by generating random “sensible” (symmetry, density and atomic separation constrained) trial cells and then geometry optimizing them to their corresponding local minima. All relaxations can be performed concurrently, with no interdependence between calculations. New trial structures are generated until the ground state of each stoichiometry (within the constraints of the search) has been found multiple times. We initially performed an exploratory AIRSS search consisting of around 5000 trial struc- tures, with constraints on cell size, stoichiometry, and number of atoms in the cell. In this initial search, the total number of atoms in the cell was constrained to be ≤40, and the total number of formula units was randomized between 1 and 4, while still keeping the total number of atoms below 40. The number of atoms of Cu and P were randomized between 1 and 9 in each cell, and the cell volume (V ) was constrained based on the total number of atoms in the cell (N) to be 8N Å3 ≤V ≤20N Å3, based on the average densities of Cu–P phases within the ICSD. Structures from the searching and enumeration procedures were then used, with ﬁtness weighted according to their distance from the convex hull, as the initial conﬁgurations for a GA implemented in the Python package ilustrado.22 The ilustrado package uses a sim- ple cut-and-splice crossover operation, supplemented by mutation operators (random noise, atomic permutations, vacancies and adatoms).30 To avoid stagnation, each trial structure was ﬁltered for similarity (via pair distribution function overlap) against existing structures in the population. Three independent GA runs were performed with 10 generations each, yielding a further 1049 relaxed structures.

In all cases, to constrain the search to physically reasonable structures, a minimum atomic separation of 1.5 Å was enforced and the maximum number of atoms in the cell was constrained to 10 for the initial ~10,000 AIRSS searches and 40 atoms per cell for the ﬁnal ~3,000 trials. All calculations were performed using CASTEP (v18.1 and v19.1), the plane wave pseu- dopotential DFT package.31 To maximize computational eﬃciency, the initial calculations were performed with loose convergence criteria that ensured formation energies converged to 10 meV/atom. The Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) exchange-correlation functional was used32 with Vanderbilt ultrasoft pseudopotentials33 that required a plane wave kinetic en- ergy cutoﬀof 300 eV to converge energies to within 10 meV/atom. The Brillouin zone (BZ) was sampled with a Monkhorst-Pack grid k-point spacing ﬁner than 2π × 0.05 Å−1; the grid was frequently recomputed to accommodate any changes in cell shape and size during re- laxation. Each structure was geometry optimized at this accuracy to a force tolerance of 0.05 eV/Å. The structures with a formation energy within 50 meV of the convex hull were then further optimized once more using CASTEP’s on-the-ﬂy (OTF) “C18” library of ultra- soft pseudopotentials1 with a ﬁner k-point sampling of 2π × 0.03 Å−1 and plane wave kinetic energy cutoﬀof 500 eV, which yielded formation energies converged to within 2.5 meV/atom. In order to predict the voltage proﬁles with the same convergence criteria (formation energies within 2.5 meV/atom), the relaxation of known Li–P structures required a higher plane wave cutoﬀof 700 eV. Therefore, to compare ternary phases of Cu–Li–P in the voltage proﬁle, all Cu–Li–P phases were re-optimized at a plane wave kinetic energy cutoﬀof 700 eV. To identify stable structures from this search, a convex hull of the copper phosphides was created.

In order to calculate the voltage proﬁles shown in the section on Cu2P as a Li-ion battery conversion anode, the voltage, ¯V , between two tie-lines in the ternary convex hull with compositions Lix1CunP and Lix2CunP was calculated using, ¯V (x1, x2) = −E(Lix1CunP) −E(Lix2CunP) −(x1 −x2)E(Li) (x1 −x2)F , (2) as stated by Urban et al.35 In equation 2, E(Lix1CunP) and E(Lix2CunP) are the ground state energies of two phases on along the reaction pathway of the ternary convex hull, in which x1 and x2 are the relative amounts of Li in the starting and ending products at each point in the pathway.

The band structure for Cu2P was calculated using the higher accuracy parameters and pseudopotentials mentioned previously, and the electronic density of states was integrated and projected onto atomic orbitals using the OptaDOS code.38,39 Vibrational properties of all stable phases were computed using the ﬁnite displacement method, with an added many-body dispersion correction (MBD denoted MBD* in CASTEP v19.0)40 to account for inter-layer interactions in black phosphorus. 7", "page": 6, "position": 0}

Results From the search of ~20,000 trial structures, there are 42 unique phases within 50 meV/atom of the convex hull. Previous computational structure searches have used a distance above the hull of 25 meV/atom,41 and given the accuracy of PBE,42 we chose to increase this cutoﬀto 50 meV/atom. Furthermore the experimentally veriﬁed P63cm–Cu3P structure43 is 37 meV/atom above the convex hull tie-line, further justifying this cut-oﬀ. Uniqueness was determined by computing pairwise overlap integrals of the pair distribution functions of phases at each stoichiometry using matador.

The resulting crystal structures, shown in Figure S1, show two diﬀerent long range orderings of the Cu sub-network. P63cm–Cu3P has only one, 8-fold coordinated, P site which results in continuous zig-zag chains of Cu atoms surrounding the P, which are at the peaks of the buckles in the zig-zag. In I¯4–Cu3P, there are two 9-fold coordinated sites; one site at the center of the surrounding Cu (seen in Figure S1) and one at the edges, which together form a hexagonal Cu cage surrounding the P atom in the center. While both phases have high- coordinated P atoms, the I¯43d–Cu3P shows a network of Cu atoms surrounding a central P atom, where P63cm–Cu3P contains inﬁnite Cu chains in the c direction. Another trigonal phase, P¯3c1–Cu3P (ICSD 16841,49 ∆E > 50 meV/atom) has the same structure as P¯3c1–Cu3As (ICSD 1684049), however it is 82 meV/atom above the convex hull tie-line. To the best of our knowledge, there are no reports of an I¯43d–Cu3P phase, either experimentally or in a computational database. The PDF and PXRD patterns of I¯43d–Cu3P given in Figure S2, show no relation to any other Cu3P phase, or the Fm¯3m–Cu2P phase, thus, if energetically stable, it could be identiﬁed using PXRD in experiment. Fm¯3m–Cu2P The Fm¯3m–Cu2P phase was found from the prototype Fm¯3m-Ir2P (ICSD 640898).58 Com- paring the Cu2P phase to both Ir2P and Rh2P using PDFs in Figure S3 shows that the PDFs are identical between all three structures, and the PXRD plot of Cu2P has the same peaks, all shifted to slightly higher values of 2θ due to structural relaxations in the geometry optimization of Cu2P. Previously, a 2D structure of Cu2P was predicted theoretically as a buckled non-magnetic material,56 in which the magnetism expected was inhibited by the buckled layers. The buckled layers from the 2D phase are also present in the bulk Fm¯3m–Cu2P, and the non- magnetic nature was conﬁrmed in the bulk phase by the lack of spin-polarization in the density of states shown in Figure S4.

Fm¯3m–Cu2P lies on the convex hull tie-line, and is energetically more stable than both the experimentally conﬁrmed phase of P63cm–Cu3P, and its defect structure Cmc21–Cu8P3. Figure 5 shows the phonon dispersion for the Fm¯3m–Cu2P computed as mentioned in the Methods section. No imaginary phonon frequencies were present in the dynamical matrix (interpolated or otherwise), indicating that Fm¯3m–Cu2P is dynamically stable. The electronic structure of Fm¯3m–Cu2P is related to the electronic structure of other Fm¯3m TMPs, suggesting it belongs to the same class of materials as Fm¯3m-Ir2P and Rh2P. Of the TMPs in the Materials Project database,59 21 are insulating, and 68 are metallic with a high density of transition metal d-bands below the Fermi level. Figure 6 shows the electronic band structure and density of states of Fm¯3m–Cu2P projected by species along the high-symmetry path from SeeK-path used previously, and the density of states projected by angular momentum channel on a ﬁne Monkhorst-Pack grid. The band structure shows that Cu2P is a metal with P and Cu bands touching at the Γ point ~2.0 eV above the Fermi level. In addition there is a characteristic high density of ﬂat bands localized on the Cu ions that exhibit d-character around 2.5 eV below the Fermi level. Calculating this band structure using the HSE06 functional (shown in Figure S5), a hybrid functional designed to correct for band gap underestimation, the gap at Γ between the Cu and P bands is closed. Many M2P phases (where M is a transition metal) have a structure similar to P¯62m- Ni2P60 and Fe2P61,62 in which the metal atoms sit in a cage of 3-fold coordinated P and 4-fold coordinated metal atoms. Fm¯3m–Cu2P is most similar to the other Fm¯3m TMPs, as it was derived from a the prototype structure Fm¯3m-Ir2P, and has 4-fold coordinated Cu with 8-fold coordinated P. The Cu2P band structure in Figure 6 is also similar to those of Ir2P and Rh2P. In Rh2P there is a directionally opened gap 1 eV above", "page": 16, "position": 0}

Both of these structures exhibit spin-orbit coupling due to their heavy metal ions, while Cu has negligible spin-orbit coupling eﬀects. The Rh2P and Ir2P band structures are calculated including spin-orbit coupling. Finite-Temperature Phase Stability The temperature-dependent convex hull was constructed by calculating the ﬁnite-temperature Gibbs free energies by including vibrational eﬀects at the harmonic level63 of several related structures on or near the convex hull from Figure 1. All structures within 20 meV/atom of the hull at 0 K were included in the ﬁnite-temperature hull; these were Fm¯3m–Cu2P, I¯43d–Cu3P, Cmc21–Cu8P3 (the structure with 2 Cu vacancies from P63cm–Cu3P discussed previously), CuP2, CuP10, Cu2P7, and Cu3P11. The chemical potentials for this binary convex hull were Cmca-P (black phosphorus) and Fm¯3m–Cu. Previously, Mayo et al. noted that the inclusion of semi-empirical dispersion corrections for black phosphorus changed the energetics of the convex hull,26 and therefore it is not possible to combine optimized structures with and without dispersion corrections on the same convex hull. However, in order to obtain non-imaginary phonon frequencies of Cmca-P, it is necessary to account for dispersion. To account for this the many-body dispersion correction (MBD) was applied during the geometry optimization and phonon calculation.40 Using PBE the distance between P chains in black phosphorus is 3.95 Å. By applying this correction, the P–P chain distance was reduced to 3.58 Å. In order to include the MBD black phosphorus on the convex hull in Figure 7a, we calculated the free energy of black phosphorus F(T), at a given temperature T as, F(T) = H + ∆F MBD∗(T), (3) where H is the enthalpy without the dispersion correction, and ∆F MBD∗(T) is the free energy contribution at temperature T with the MBD dispersion correction, which includes the zero- 20", "page": 19, "position": 0}

The SCAN functional accurately describes the phonon modes of black phosphorus without any added dispersion corrections (i.e. no imaginary modes are observed) and therefore is used as a comparison to the MBD corrected PBE functional in Figure S7. Figure S7 shows that for any temperature T, both ∆F MBD(T) and ∆F SCAN(T) are on the same scale, only the zero-point energy is shifted (by 2.6 meV/atom) for the PBE+MBD calculation. Therefore, we expect the results of the PBE+MBD free energies to be comparable with non-dispersion corrected PBE free energies. Using the MBD correction on black phosphorus in addition to the phonon modes of the previously mentioned phases of Cu–P, the hull in Figure 7a was constructed up to 600 K, above which no changes to stabilities are observed. A maximum value of 600 K was cho- sen so as not to approach the melting point of any phases, as the known phases of Cu–P typically have melt between 800 and 1200 K. Furthermore, the harmonic approximation is a limited approach, and at higher temperatures, anharmonicity should be accounted for. Fm¯3m–Cu2P remains on the hull at 600 K, suggesting it could be synthesized at high tem- perature. The convex hull is conﬁrmation that the Cmc21–Cu8P3 phase formed from two Cu vacancies in P63cm–Cu3P is the more stable phase at room temperature, as at 300 K, Cmc21–Cu8P3 is within 10 meV/atom of the convex hull as shown in Figure 7b. In addition, the destabilization of I¯43d–Cu3P at high temperatures, shown in Figure 7b suggests that this phase is not experimentally realizable, and provides an explanation as to why it has not yet been experimentally synthesized. We can clearly see that P63cm–Cu3P is stabilized at higher temperatures, as shown in Figure 7b, in which it is within 10 meV/atom of the convex hull at temperatures higher than 450 K. Previous work on the Cu3−xP phases of P63cm–Cu3P47 conﬁrms that the formation of two vacancies in Cu3P is energetically stabilizing. By enumerating all of the", "page": 21, "position": 0}

Given the large number of ways to introduce these vacancies into the structure, conﬁgurational entropy will further stabilize this phase at high temperatures. To fully understand the nature of vacancy formation in P63cm–Cu3P a full cluster expansion could be performed, which is beyond the scope of this paper. Cu2P as a Li-ion battery conversion anode Fm¯3m–Cu2P was computationally predicted to be energetically stable as both a 2D mate- rial56 and now in this article as a bulk phase. The previous sections predict the stability of Fm¯3m–Cu2P at temperatures up to 600 K, and characterize it as a metal with dispersive bands and delocalized conduction states at the Fermi level. An intuitive choice of applica- tion for Cu2P lies in conversion anodes for Li-ion batteries, where previously both CuP2 and Cu3P were used as anodes with gravimetric capacities between 300 and 800 mAh/g.11–14 The crystal structure of P63cm–Cu3P has a theoretical capacity of 363 mAh/g and experimentally has exhibited a range of capacities based upon the preparation method used.13 The powdered Cu3P anodes prepared by Bichat et al13 ranged in initial capac- ity from 272 mAh/g using high-temperature synthesis in a silica tube to 527 mAh/g using low-temperature solvothermal synthesis respectively. In the solvothermal route, the Cu3P powders were prepared with copper chloride, water, and NH4OH with white phosphorus, which could have resulted copper oxide impurities leading to the initial capacity which is above the theoretical capacity of crystalline Cu3P. Cu3P powder synthesized by a solid-state reaction with red P in an ethanol suspension and Cu foil, the initial capacity of Cu3P was 415 mAh/g.14 Energy dispersive X-ray analysis showed that the stoichiometry was close to Cu3P (though not exact) suggesting that this initial structure could have been within the stoichiometric range of Cu3−xP in order to achieve that initial capacity, in addition to the added capacity from likely oxide impurities. In contrast, Cu2P has a theoretical capacity of 509 mAh/g, which is above that of graphite 23", "page": 22, "position": 0}

The metallic nature of Cu2P further enhances its use as a Li-ion battery an- ode, enabling fast electronic transfer through the electrode of the battery. In fact, Cu is already widely used as a current collector in contemporary Li-ion batteries, and previous studies on Cu3P nanorods suggest that Cu–P anodes create a synergistic chemical interface with the Cu-current collector which promotes cyclability.15 Furthermore, because of its com- paratively lower P content, volume changes during cycling are reduced, and therefore the degradation is likely to be less severe.12 The volume expansion for a conversion anode, with an overall conversion reaction CuaPb + 3b Li −→a Cu + b Li3P, (4) is calculated as, Volume expansion (%) = 100 × b V (Li3P) + a V (Cu) V (CuaPb) −1 ! , (5) where V (CuaPb) is the volume per formula unit of each phase in the conversion reaction. Using this equation, the volume expansion of Fm¯3m–Cu2P is 99 %. This is comparable to the calculated volume expansion of P63cm–Cu3P, which is 86 %, and far superior to the volume expansion of CuP2, which is 165 %. The volume expansion for each binary Cu–P phase is shown in Figure S8, conﬁrming that Cu2P has the lowest volume expansion of the four stable phases on the convex hull. Experimental reports on cycling of ball-milled CuP2 12 suggest that volume expansion occurs, as after cycling for 10 cycles, the capacity is reduced by 50 %, although they give no estimate of the level of volume expansion in the cell. The expansion is partially mitigated through the use of nanostructuring,11 which allows cycling for 200 cycles. However, there is still capacity fading in this case, which reiterates the need for a high capacity conversion anode with low volume expansion, so as to reduce the need for nanostructuring or other post-processing techniques to mitigate volume expansion.

All of the known ternary structures were included in this hull: P¯3m1–Cu2LiP, I4/mmm–Cu2LiP2, Immm–Cu4Li5P6 and Cmcm–CuLi2P, as well as the binary Li–P structures Cmcm-Li3P, P21/c-LiP, P212121-Li3P7 and I41/acd-LiP7. A plane wave kinetic energy cutoﬀof 700 eV was used, and all structures on the hull were re- relaxed at this higher cutoﬀ. The ternary hull is shown in Figure S9, in which the pathways from Cu–P to Li are also shown, to depict how the voltage proﬁles for these Cu–P phases were calculated. The hull is shaded with a colormap to show the relative formation energy of phases on the hull, indicating that the Li–P phases have larger formation energies (and thus create a deeper convex hull) than the Cu–P phases. Although Cu–Li phases are predicted to be stable under the approximation of PBE, the formation energy of the predicted Cu3Li phase is only 26 meV/atom in the OQMD database19,64 and no phases of Cu–Li are predicted at ﬁnite temperature in experiment.65 Furthermore, Cu is used as a current collector in Li ion batteries speciﬁcally for its properties in resisting Li intercalation, and dead Li is found during cycling rather than Cu–Li phases.66 Therefore, no Cu–Li compounds were included in the convex hull.

In addition to conﬁrming the stability of Cmc21–Cu8P3, we also conﬁrmed that Cm– Cu3P11 remains metastable up to high temperatures as shown in the temperature dependent hull in Figure 7. While Cu3P11 is unlikely to be used as a Li-ion battery anode, given its high P content, and therefore susceptibility to volume expansion, it could be a novel phase to consider within the Cu–P phase diagram. CuP10 was identiﬁed experimentally by preparing Cu2P7 in excess P;70 given the structural similarity between Cm–Cu3P11 and C2/m–Cu2P7 shown in Figure 2, it is possible that Cm–Cu3P11 is also formed in excess P. Using the PXRD patterns presented in Figure 3, it may be possible to distinguish the Cm–Cu3P11 phase from C2/m–Cu2P7 experimentally, from the change in peak intensity at 16◦, and peak diﬀerences at 2θ values < 20◦, however further experimental analysis is likely required given the low intensity of this peak. Finally, Fm¯3m–Cu2P is the only phase identiﬁed through crystal structure prediction which was found on the hull at 0 K, and which remained on the convex hull at ﬁnite tem- perature, strongly suggesting it is possible to synthesize Cu2P experimentally. Furthermore, its synthesis could provide a novel conversion anode, with favorable properties for Li-ion batteries. Hybrid functional calculations of the electronic properties of Cu2P predict it to be isostructural and qualitatively similar electronically to both Rh2P and Ir2P, which are also Fm¯3m metals with dispersive bands at the Fermi level.

PXRD peak intensities were corrected with atomic scattering factors, Lorentz-polarization correction and a thermal broadening term with an element-independent Debye-Waller factor (B = 1). All peaks were then artiﬁcially broadened with a Lorentzian envelope of width 0.03 ◦, which ignores instrument-dependent and momentum-dependent peak broadening. PDFs were computed from pairwise atomic dis- tances in non-diagonal supercells to ensure all appropriate distances were considered within the region shown (1–8 Å). The pairwise distances were then collected as a histogram and broadened with a Gaussian envelope of width 0.01 Å. In these calculations, no element- dependence was introduced into the scattering behavior of each atom and thus intensities are not expected to match experimental data. Details of band structure calculations To calculate the spin-orbit coupled electronic band structures for Cu2P, Ir2P and Rh2P, J-dependent pseudopotentials were used to account for coupling between orbitals, as imple- mented in CASTEP v20.1. All band structures were calculated using paths generated with SeeK-path,36 with a k-point spacing of 2π × 0.03 Å−1. The Cu J-dependent pseudopotential required a higher plane wave kinetic energy cutoﬀof 1000 eV, while both Rh and Ir required only 500 eV. 1", "page": 36, "position": 0}
