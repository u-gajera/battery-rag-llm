Introduction With the rapid advancement of energy storage technologies, high-performance solid-state electrolytes (SSEs) have emerged as critical materials for next-generation lithium-ion batteries[1-4]. These materials are required to exhibit high ionic conductivity, excellent electrochemical stability, and robust mechanical strength to meet the demands of modern applications such as electric vehicles and portable electronic devices[5-10]. However, traditional design and screening methods, such as density functional theory (DFT) calculations and empirical force field simulations[11-15], often face challenges such as high computational costs, poor scalability, and insufficient accuracy across diverse material systems. In this context, universal machine learning interatomic potentials (uMLIPs)[16-19] have emerged as a promising solution to bridge the gap between quantum mechanical methods and classical simulations.

Despite their promising potential, uMLIPs still exhibit limitations. For instance, some models struggle to extrapolate beyond the chemical space of their training data and fail to ensure physical consistency when calculating derived quantities such as forces or stresses[20- 24]. Additionally, the predictive accuracy of these models varies across different material classes, highlighting the importance of carefully validating and selecting appropriate models for specific applications. To address these challenges, this study develops a systematic benchmark framework for SSEs to evaluate the performance of state-of- the-art uMLIPs—MatterSim[23], MACE[25], SevenNet[26], CHGNet[27], M3GNet[28], and ORBFF[29]—in complex material systems. Specifically, we assess their capabilities in three key areas: 1. Energy and force calculation: Accurate representation of potential energy surfaces and interatomic forces is fundamental to atomic simulations. Here, we compare the mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean square error (RMSE) of calculated energies and forces against DFT benchmarks, covering a wide range of halide, oxide, and sulfide electrolyte structures. Our analysis includes near-equilibrium and non-equilibrium structures sampled across extensive temperature and pressure ranges, ensuring comprehensive coverage of operational conditions. 2. Material property calculations: Beyond basic energy and force calculation, we delve into more complex material properties, including bulk modulus, shear modulus, formation energy, and energy above the convex hull (E_above_hull). These metrics provide valuable insights into the mechanical integrity, thermodynamic stability, and synthetic feasibility of candidate SSEs. By correlating uMLIPs calculation with DFT results, we aim to uncover patterns that reveal the strengths and weaknesses of models in capturing subtle yet crucial aspects of material behavior. 3. Lithium-ion diffusion simulations: Most critically, we investigate the ability of each uMLIP to reproduce lithium- ion diffusion coefficients across multiple SSE families—a direct measure of ionic conductivity. Using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations guided by uMLIPs, we compute mean square displacements (MSD) at various temperatures and extract diffusion constants.

As uMLIP models continue to evolve rapidly, systematically assessing their performance has become a critical challenge. Our framework provides a standardized tool for evaluating current models and lays the groundwork for the development and optimization of future uMLIPs. The results demonstrate that MatterSim excels in nearly all evaluation metrics, particularly in calculating the thermodynamic, kinetic, and ion transport properties of SSEs with high precision and robustness. Even under challenging non-equilibrium conditions, MatterSim achieves exceptionally low MAEs for energy and force calculation, closely aligning with DFT and DeepMD benchmarks. It performs notably well in simulating bulk modulus, shear modulus, formation energy, energy stability, and lithium-ion diffusion pathways and activation barriers. Further analysis using MatterSim reveals the critical roles of S/Cl anion disorder levels and Na/Li arrangements in lithium- ion diffusion in Li₆PS₅Cl and Li₃YCl₆. For instance, an S/Cl disorder level of approximately 40%-50% in Li₆PS₅Cl optimizes diffusion pathway connectivity, significantly enhancing conductivity. In NaxLi₃₋ₓYCl₆, increasing lithium content expands diffusion channels and introduces local disorder, lowering migration energy barriers and improving ion transport performance.

CHGNet, based on a deep graph neural network with a sophisticated and efficient architecture, utilizes atomic magnetic moments to capture magnetic properties. It demonstrates strong convergence in structure optimization and moderate performance in energy calculation but shows significant errors in phonon property calculation[31]. MACE achieves high efficiency and accuracy through higher- order equivariant message-passing neural networks and E(3)-equivariant representations, leveraging atomic cluster expansions to enhance computational efficiency[32-34]. It excels in thermodynamic property calculations but shows larger errors in calculating elastic modulus-related properties. SevenNet, optimized for parallel computing based on NequIP[34], performs well in optimizing geometric structures and calculating thermodynamic properties but exhibits considerable errors in elastic modulus calculation. MatterSim combines the architectures of M3GNet and Graphormer to process material graphs, integrating extensive data through active learning and a unique data explorer, demonstrating the best overall performance across various property calculation. ORBFF directly outputs forces to improve computational efficiency, showing excellent performance in structure optimization and static energy calculation but exhibiting significant systematic biases in many thermodynamic property calculation. Benchmark testing of these advanced uMLIPs models reveals their strengths and limitations in different application scenarios. These results indicate that while all models achieve a certain level of accuracy in structure optimization, energy, and force calculation, the choice of model and the physical consistency of its computational methods significantly impact the accuracy of material property predictions. 2.2. Calculation of material properties based on uMLIPs The process for calculating energy and forces based on uMLIPs is as follows: First, the process utilizes the RelaxCalc module within the Atomic Simulation Environment (ASE)[35] framework to perform structure optimization. During the initialization stage, users need to specify uMLIPs as the calculator and set key parameters such as the optimization algorithm (e.g., Fast Inertial Relaxation Engine-FIRE)[36], maximum optimization steps, convergence threshold (fmax), and whether to relax atomic positions or cell shape. Subsequently, the system converts the input crystal structure into an ASE atom object and loads the uMLIPs calculator to predict interatomic interaction potentials", "page": 2, "position": 0}

During the initialization stage, users need to specify uMLIPs as the calculator and set key parameters such as the optimization algorithm (e.g., Fast Inertial Relaxation Engine-FIRE)[36], maximum optimization steps, convergence threshold (fmax), and whether to relax atomic positions or cell shape. Subsequently, the system converts the input crystal structure into an ASE atom object and loads the uMLIPs calculator to predict interatomic interaction potentials and their gradients (i.e., forces). During optimization, atomic positions and cell parameters are iteratively adjusted to minimize the total system energy while recording trajectory information at each step for subsequent analysis. The final output includes optimized structural parameters (e.g., lattice constants, volume, and angles), total system energy, atomic force distribution, and stress tensors. This process not only ensures physical consistency in energy and force calculations but also effectively reduces finite-size effects and non-physical distortions by incorporating tools such as trajectory observers and cell filters, providing a reliable foundation for studying the dynamic behavior of complex material systems like SSEs. The procedure for calculating thermodynamic and mechanical properties of materials (including bulk modulus, shear modulus, formation energy, and convex hull energy) using uMLIPs is as follows: First, the material structure and correction energies are obtained from the Materials Project (MP)[37], and its CIF file is loaded to create a structure object. A universal atomic potential function is used as the ASE calculator, with SCF energy convergence and force convergence thresholds set to 10⁻⁵ eV and 0.05 eV/Å, respectively. The structure undergoes relaxation calculations to obtain the optimized structure and energy. Based on the relaxed structure and energy, a ComputedStructureEntry object is created by combining correction energies, and all entries within the chemical system (including MP data, derived data, and MatterSim results) are queried via the pymatgen interface. To ensure compatibility, MatterSim applies Hubbard U corrections for elements with localized d-electrons, aligning with MP data. Subsequently, a phase diagram is constructed to calculate formation energy and convex hull energy. Additionally, bulk and shear moduli are calculated by applying strain and analyzing stress responses. The final results are stored as JSON files in", "page": 2, "position": 1}

Additionally, bulk and shear moduli are calculated by applying strain and analyzing stress responses. The final results are stored as JSON files in dictionary format. The specific steps for calculating elastic moduli are as follows: During initialization, parameters such as the calculator, normal strains, shear strains, maximum force, whether to relax the structure, whether to consider equilibrium stress, and additional relaxation parameters are set. If structure relaxation is enabled, the crystal structure is first optimized to reach the lowest energy state. Then, a series of deformed structures are generated, and the stress response of each structure is calculated. By linearly fitting stress data under different strain states, the components of the elastic tensor are obtained. During fitting, equilibrium stress can optionally be considered, and the sum of squared residuals is calculated to evaluate accuracy. The final results are returned in dictionary format, containing key information such as the elastic tensor, Voigt-Reuss-Hill averaged shear modulus, bulk modulus, Young’s modulus, and fitting residuals. This method not only reveals the elastic behavior of materials but also provides an efficient and precise tool for materials science research.

Atomic trajectories and thermodynamic parameters were recorded during the simulation, and the influence of local ordered states was eliminated through multi-frame averaging. The computational workflow consists of four key stages: (1) Initializing the atomic system and loading the potential function; (2) Configuring thermodynamic system parameters and couplers; (3) Performing dynamic iterations (e.g., 1000 steps corresponding to 2 ps); (4) Outputting physical quantity data and trajectory files.

Therefore, evaluating the performance of uMLIPs models in calculating lithium-ion diffusivity in SSEs is particularly important. To this end, this study systematically evaluates advanced uMLIPs models in 18 typical SSE systems, including oxide, sulfide, and halide electrolytes. We use these models to calculate lithium-ion diffusivity at various temperatures (300 K, 400 K, 500 K, 700 K, 900 K, and 1100 K), with DeepMD results serving as the reference standard. To ensure computational accuracy, NPT and NVT ensembles are employed, and long-duration (1–10 nanoseconds) MD simulations are conducted under ambient pressure. Each SSE uses a 3×3×3 supercell containing over 1,200 atoms to minimize finite-size effects and more realistically reflect ion diffusion behavior in actual materials. Additionally, considering the influence of order/disorder states on lithium-ion diffusion, we average multi-frame data to enhance statistical reliability.

The framework encompasses multidimensional assessments, including structure optimization, energy and force calculations, mechanical properties, thermodynamic properties, and kinetic properties (e.g., lithium-ion diffusivity), ensuring a thorough examination of model performance. Consistency is achieved by adopting the PBE functional consistent with the uMLIPs model training data, effectively reducing errors caused by differences in exchange-correlation functionals.

This hierarchical testing framework refines evaluation scenarios step by step, verifying that the computational accuracy of uMLIPs models significantly depends on property types (e.g., thermodynamic stability and mechanical properties). It provides crucial guidance for optimizing machine learning potentials across material properties and establishes a multiscale validation benchmark for assessing the reliability of machine learning potentials in complex material systems. Through three hierarchical datasets (general dataset, lithium-containing compound dataset, and lithium-containing SSE dataset), we systematically evaluated the computational performance of uMLIPs on four key material properties: formation energy, bulk modulus, shear modulus, and E_above_hull. Overall, the MatterSim model demonstrated the highest comprehensive accuracy and stability, while ORBFF exhibited significant systematic deviations in all property calculations, with computed values generally lower than DFT results. Specific analyses are as follows: As shown in Figures 8–10, SevenNet performed best in the calculation of formation energy; MACE and MatterSim showed similar performance; CHGNet outperformed M3GNet, while M3GNet exhibited instability. In the general dataset, M3GNet suffered from high error dispersion (213 structures exceeding five times the average error) and showed significant deviations from DFT reference values in the lithium-containing compound dataset, leading to its lower ranking. ORBFF, due to directly outputting forces instead of energy derivatives, caused physical inconsistencies, resulting in the largest computational deviations. Further analysis of the differences between the second-worst-performing M3GNet and the best-performing SevenNet in the general dataset (as shown in Supplementary Figures S38–S41) revealed that 213 structures in M3GNet, 43 in SevenNet, 75 in ORBFF, 73 in MatterSim, 50 in MACE, and 124 in CHGNet had computational errors exceeding five times the average error. Specifically, the 213 structures in M3GNet covered almost all elements in the periodic table, except for some lanthanides and actinides, with calculated formation energy values ranging from -5 to 15 eV/atom, while actual DFT-calculated values ranged from -5 to 5 eV/atom, indicating that M3GNet overestimated the formation energies of many structures.

In contrast, the best-performing SevenNet had only 43 structures with computational errors exceeding five times the average error, and these structures covered a narrower range of elements and crystal systems, with calculated values closer to DFT results. By comparing Supplementary Figures S19–S21 and S25–S27, it is evident that MatterSim performed optimally and most stably in the calculation of bulk and shear moduli. MACE and SevenNet showed similar performance but were inferior to MatterSim across almost all three levels of datasets. CHGNet and M3GNet exhibited similar computational accuracy, but M3GNet had extreme outliers in the general dataset, such as errors in bulk modulus exceeding 50 GPa. ORBFF, due to insufficient generalization capability, systematically underestimated modulus values, particularly performing poorly in shear modulus calculations. By comparing Supplementary Figures S31–S33, it is clear that SevenNet exhibited the lowest MAE and RMSE in E_above_hull calculations, demonstrating the best computational performance. Specifically, SevenNet had only 63 structures with computational errors exceeding five times the average error, indicating fewer large-error results. Further analysis using Supplementary Figures S34–S37 revealed that SevenNet had the smallest number of elements with computational errors exceeding five times the average error, and these errors were mainly concentrated in regions with high E_above_hull values, suggesting that SevenNet had certain inaccuracies in handling high E_above_hull value structures across different crystal systems.

ORBFF systematically failed in complex phase stability calculations, possibly due to its design of directly outputting forces rather than calculating them through energy derivatives. Although this approach improved efficiency, it may have led to a lack of physical consistency, thereby affecting the accuracy of energy calculations. Additionally, ORBFF's insufficient generalization capability on unseen data resulted in systematic deviations in calculations for new material systems or structures. A deeper analysis of model performance differences using Supplementary Figures S34–S41 revealed that ORBFF's failure was primarily due to its non-physical design of directly outputting forces, which led to poor consistency in energy derivatives, specifically manifesting as systematic underestimation of formation energy and E_above_hull. M3GNet's discrete errors were related to insufficient training data coverage, with error-exceeding structures widely distributed across nearly all elements in the periodic table (except for some lanthanides and actinides) and all crystal systems.

The analysis shows that MatterSim performs exceptionally well across all temperatures, particularly in the low-temperature region, where its results closely match the DeepMD reference values, demonstrating high accuracy and reliability. MACE and SevenNet perform adequately in the mid- to-high temperature range but show reduced accuracy in the low-temperature region.

ORBFF’s performance is inconsistent, with results severely deviating from the DeepMD reference values at high temperatures, while showing mixed results in the mid-to-low temperature range. To further validate these findings, Supplementary Figures S42 to S47 present the results of MD simulations conducted using MatterSim and SevenNet on typical sulfide, halide, and oxide SSEs. These simulations were performed at 300 K, using 3×3×3 supercells (with over 1200 atoms), under ambient pressure for a duration of 1 nanosecond. The figures compare the time evolution of lithium-ion MSD across different SSEs. The results indicate that at 300 K, the MSD values calculated by MatterSim are smaller than those of SevenNet and closer to the DeepMD reference values. This further confirms the superiority of MatterSim in calculating lithium-ion diffusivity in SSEs. Overall, the study finds that MatterSim produces the most accurate results, maintaining high consistency with the DeepMD reference values across all temperatures and material types. MACE and SevenNet perform reasonably well, though their trends, while generally consistent with the reference values, still show some gaps compared to MatterSim. CHGNet and M3GNet demonstrate lower accuracy, with more pronounced deviations from the reference values at higher temperatures.

Through a comprehensive evaluation of uMLIPs models, including energy and force calculations, calculation of various material properties, and lithium-ion diffusivity simulations, we found that Mattersim demonstrated the best performance across all metrics.

Figure 14 illustrates the crystal structures of Li₃YCl₆ and Li₆PS₅Cl. The crystal structure of Li₃YCl₆ includes various geometric structures such as square pyramids, trigonal bipyramids, and octahedra, which provide multiple potential diffusion pathways for lithium ions. However, the relatively short bond lengths (e.g., Li(1)-Cl bond lengths of 2.44– 2.67 Å), large octahedral tilting angles (42–77°), and strong binding energies significantly restrict the long-range diffusion of lithium ions. Additionally, the dynamic triangular pyramidal and planar triangular coordination among Cl atoms further complicates the diffusion process. Although Li₃YCl₆ possesses three-dimensional ion channels, its complex geometry and strong ion-framework interactions result in low overall ionic conductivity. Li₆PS₅Cl belongs to the cubic crystal system with space group F-43m, featuring a cage-like framework composed of S²⁻ and Cl⁻ ions, which provides localized diffusion pathways for lithium ions. However, the short bond lengths between Li⁺ and S²⁻ (e.g., Li-S bond lengths of 2.33–2.42 Å) and the strong bonding limit the long-range diffusion of lithium ions. Furthermore, the rigid tetrahedral structure formed by P⁵⁺ and S²⁻ enhances the framework's stability, reducing the diffusion freedom of lithium ions. Although SLi₆ octahedra and SLi₃P tetrahedra are connected via shared corners, offering multiple diffusion pathways, the octahedral tilting angle (approximately 54°) increases the difficulty of diffusion, resulting in lower long-range diffusion efficiency.", "page": 14, "position": 0}

These results demonstrate that this method can effectively assess the thermal stability of materials with high computational accuracy and reliability. To evaluate the phase stability of Li₃YCl₆ and Li₆PS₅Cl, we constructed their 0 K phase diagrams within their respective chemical spaces (Li−Y−Cl and Li−P−S−Cl) in the Figure 15. First, we used MatterSim combined with the Atomic Simulation Environment (ASE) tools to optimize the structures and calculate their energies. Subsequently, Pymatgen was utilized to obtain all possible combination phases within the chemical spaces (e.g., Li, Y, Cl, and their combinations for Li₃YCl₆; Li, P, S, Cl, and their combinations for Li₆PS₅Cl). Based on this data, calculations were performed on three-dimensional (for Li₃YCl₆) or four-dimensional (for Li₆PS₅Cl) convex hulls, constructed based on normalized energy per atom and elemental atomic fractions. The vertices of the convex hulls were projected onto the composition coordinate space to generate the phase diagrams. Next, the E_above_hull values (energy differences relative to stable phases) of Li₃YCl₆ and Li₆PS₅Cl were calculated. The results show that the E_above_hull for Li₃YCl₆ is 30.4 meV/atom (DFT reference value: 28.5 meV/atom), and for Li₆PS₅Cl, it is 83.5 meV/atom (DFT reference value: 83.0 meV/atom).

To more accurately assess stability, we adopted a lithium chemical potential reference method based on bulk lithium energy rather than the traditional internal energy phase diagram approach. This method effectively reveals the electrochemical behavior of the materials across different voltage ranges. Li₃YCl₆ exhibits a broad electrochemical stability window (0.6 to 4.2 V), indicating its stability across a wide range of battery operating voltages, which is critical for safe battery operation. In contrast, Li₆PS₅Cl has a narrower stability range (1.7 to 2.3 V). However, under extreme voltages, Li₆PS₅Cl forms electronically insulating but ionically conductive phases (e.g., Li₂S and LiCl), which act as passivation layers to prevent further decomposition, thereby protecting the electrolyte and extending battery life. Notably, the calculation results from MatterSim are highly consistent with DFT, with calculated electrochemical stability windows and key phase transition points closely matching DFT reference values, fully validating its high accuracy. Through the above analysis, MatterSim not only provides precise energy data but also demonstrates significant application potential in the study of halide and sulfide electrolytes.

Particularly, the range of tilt angles for corner-sharing octahedra (42–77°) increases the difficulty for lithium ions to hop between octahedra. For Li₆PS₅Cl (Figure 17d), lithium ions tend to move within a cage-like environment surrounding the S 4d sites, forming distorted Li₆S octahedra. The high-value isosurfaces reveal that the motion of lithium ions is mainly confined within specific cage-like structures, and this localized diffusion contributes little to long-range transport. The cage- like structure, composed of S and Cl atoms, allows lithium ions to vibrate rapidly but rarely cross into other cages, further limiting long-range ion transport. This localized behavior suggests that although Li₆PS₅Cl exhibits some degree of local ion diffusion capability, its overall ionic conductivity remains constrained by the cage-like structure. To further explore the influence of temperature on the diffusion behavior of lithium ions, we conducted 100 ps MD simulations of Li₃YCl₆ and Li₆PS₅Cl at higher temperatures (700 K and 1100 K). Figures S50a and b illustrate the MSD of Li₃YCl₆ at 700 K and 1100 K, while Figures S51a and b present the MSD of Li₆PS₅Cl at the same temperatures. These results visually reflect the diffusion dynamics of lithium ions in the two materials under high-temperature conditions.

By analyzing the van Hove function, we can gain deeper insights into the diffusion paths and dynamic behavior of lithium ions. Figures 18a and c show the Gs and Gd results for Li₃YCl₆. The Gs plot reveals a persistent peak in the 2 to 4 Å range, with additional peaks at larger r values appearing after approximately 300 ps. This indicates that lithium ions in Li₃YCl₆ not only diffuse within cages but also migrate between cages, achieving a degree of long-range diffusion. The Gd plot further shows that Li₃YCl₆ exhibits a broader high-probability distribution over shorter timescales, with more high-probability peaks emerging over time, suggesting frequent cage-to-cage transitions and effective long-range diffusion. Figure18b and d present the Gs and Gd results for Li₆PS₅Cl. The Gs plot shows a persistent peak in the 4 to 5 Å range, corresponding to the nearest Li-Li distances within the same cage, indicating that lithium ions are primarily confined to intracage diffusion with limited contribution to long-range diffusion. The Gd plot confirms this localized behavior, showing that high-probability distributions are concentrated within short-time intracage diffusion, with minimal intercage transitions.

By exchanging Cl at the 4a site with S at the 4d site, Li₆PS₅Cl structures with varying S/Cl disorder levels (15%, 25%, 40%, 50%, and 75%) were generated. For 0% and 100% disorder levels, only one structure was considered and optimized using DFT. For other disorder levels, the four structures with the lowest Ewald energies were selected for DFT optimization, retaining the most stable configuration. During the MatterSim optimization process, the SCF energy convergence threshold was set to 10⁻⁵ eV, and the force convergence threshold was set to 0.05 eV/Å. Figure 19a illustrates the effect of different S/Cl disorder levels on lithium-ion conductivity at room temperature. The results show that the lithium-ion conductivity initially increases with increasing disorder levels, reaching a peak at approximately 40%-50%, before decreasing. This trend is consistent with DeepMD calculations, and the similar MSD variation trend is also shown in Supplementary Figure S52. Figure S54 compares the MSD and lithium-ion probability density distributions at 0% and 40% disorder levels, further validating the accuracy of the MatterSim calculations. The analysis indicates that low disorder levels result in discontinuous inter-cage hopping pathways, leading to low conductivity. As the disorder level increases, effective hopping pathways form, enhancing conductivity. However, when the disorder level exceeds 40%, dual-ion hopping pathways are suppressed, causing the diffusion network to disconnect again and resulting in reduced conductivity. These findings reveal the influence of", "page": 19, "position": 1}

This result aligns with DeepMD calculations and the MSD trends presented in Supplementary Figure S53. Figure S55 compares the MSD and lithium-ion probability density distributions of Li₃YCl₆ and Na₁.₅Li₁.₅YCl₆, further verifying the reliability of MatterSim. The smaller radius (0.76 Å) and high mobility of Li⁺ ions are key factors contributing to the enhanced conductivity. Additionally, increasing Li content may optimize the crystal structure by expanding diffusion channels or introducing local disorder, thereby reducing migration energy barriers. For example, the activation energy of Na₂LiYCl₆ (x = 2) is 0.6 eV, lower than the 0.82 eV of Na₃YCl₆ (x = 3), indicating that increased Li content significantly improves low-temperature ion migration capability[43]. Higher Li content also increases the concentration of mobile ions, optimizing charge balance and local electric field distribution, further promoting ion transport. Collectively, these factors enhance the material's ionic conductivity, confirming the potential of NaxLi₃₋ₓYCl₆ as a high-performance SSE and providing important insights for designing novel ion-conductive materials. Figure 20 shows the lithium-ion probability density distributions obtained via MD simulations using MatterSim at 300 K and 500 K, for different S/Cl anion disorder levels (0%, 40%, and 75%). The isosurfaces are plotted based on a contour level of 0.0002/a₀³ (where a₀ is the Bohr radius). Figure 20 illustrates the probability density distribution of lithium ions at different S/Cl anion disorder levels, obtained through MD simulations at 300 K and 500 K. At 0% S/Cl disorder level, lithium ions are confined within isolated lithium clusters, with a lack of significant connections between clusters, leading to restricted lithium-ion diffusion and consequently lower ionic conductivity. At 40% S/Cl disorder level, continuous diffusion pathways form between lithium clusters, allowing lithium ions to move more freely, resulting in higher ionic conductivity. However, at 75% S/Cl disorder level, lithium ions are again localized in specific regions, and the diffusion pathways become discontinuous, causing a decline in lithium-ion conductivity. These changes in lithium-ion probability density distribution visually reveal the influence of S/Cl anion disorder levels on", "page": 20, "position": 0}

These comparisons intuitively reveal the critical role of Na/Li arrangements in ion transport behavior. In studying NaxLi₃₋ₓYCl₆, we combined MatterSim with the Pymatgen library to address the issue of solid-solution disorder in Na/Li positions within the crystal structure and generated ordered structures. The specific steps were as follows: The prototype structure of Li₃YCl₆ was obtained from the ICSD database. By partially replacing Li with Na (x = 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0), all symmetrically distinct structures were enumerated using Pymatgen's enumlib tool, followed by geometric optimization using MatterSim. The lowest-energy structures were ultimately selected (see Table 3) to provide a foundation for subsequent property calculations. Based on the MatterSim, NVT MD simulations were conducted for 1 ns under ambient pressure, using a 3×3×3 supercell (with more than 1200 atoms) at 300 K, to calculate the ionic conductivity and diffusivity of lithium and sodium ions at different solid-solution ratios. The results indicate: (1) The introduction of sodium ions significantly reduces ionic conductivity, with sodium conductivity being much lower than that of lithium ions; (2) Different Na/Li arrangements significantly affect ionic conductivity, with notable differences observed among structures with the same solid-solution ratio. Figure 21 further analyzes the impact of Na/Li arrangement on ionic conductivity. Figure 21a shows the Na/Li arrangement corresponding to the maximum lithium-ion conductivity for different x values (x = 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0) in Table 3, along with the time evolution of MSD; Figure 21b presents the corresponding results for the minimum conductivity. Comparative analysis reveals that high-conductivity structures typically exhibit optimized coordination network topology and continuous three-dimensional diffusion pathways. For example, in Na₀.₅Li₂.₅YCl₆, the high- conductivity structure features NaCl₆ octahedra densely interconnected via edge- and face-sharing with LiCl₆ and YCl₆ octahedra, significantly reducing the migration energy barrier for lithium ions.

For Na₁.₅Li₁.₅YCl₆, the monoclinic P2₁ structure enhances lithium-ion diffusion efficiency by simplifying cation distribution and optimizing edge/face sharing, while the triclinic P1 structure forms high-energy barrier bottlenecks due to distorted octahedra and complex Cl coordination modes. In Na₂.₀Li₁.₀YCl₆, the high-conductivity structure achieves efficient diffusion through an open framework and low activation energy pathways, whereas the low-conductivity structure experiences broken pathways and stress accumulation due to extreme bond length variations and local lattice distortions, further inhibiting ion transport. These results demonstrate that differences in lithium-ion conductivity primarily arise from the combined effects of crystal structure symmetry, coordination network connectivity, and local lattice distortions. They reveal the key mechanisms for optimizing Na/Li arrangements to enhance ionic conductivity, providing important theoretical guidance for designing high-performance SSE materials. 5. Discussion With the rapid development of uMLIPs models, how to comprehensively and accurately evaluate their performance has become a key challenge in the field. Our framework, through multi-level and multi-dimensional test designs, covers core metrics such as energy, forces, thermodynamic properties, elastic moduli, and lithium-ion diffusion behavior, ensuring a thorough examination of model performance while highlighting the critical roles of training data quality and physical consistency in model performance. This provides a standardized tool for systematically evaluating the performance of uMLIPs models and lays a solid foundation for the development and optimization of novel uMLIPs models in the future. Through systematic evaluation of uMLIPs models, we found that MatterSim excels in almost all assessment metrics, particularly demonstrating significantly superior predictive accuracy and generalization capabilities in complex material systems compared to other models. Its outstanding performance is attributed to advanced architecture design and the application of active learning strategies, enabling it to efficiently capture many- body interactions and exhibit excellent robustness across chemical spaces. In contrast, models like ORBFF and CHGNet, while performing adequately in structure optimization and static energy calculation, show significant deviations in dynamic behavior and thermodynamic property calculation, especially under extreme conditions. This further underscores the critical impact of model design", "page": 23, "position": 0}

In contrast, models like ORBFF and CHGNet, while performing adequately in structure optimization and static energy calculation, show significant deviations in dynamic behavior and thermodynamic property calculation, especially under extreme conditions. This further underscores the critical impact of model design philosophy (e.g., energy derivative consistency and training data coverage) on prediction accuracy and generalization capability. Based on MatterSim simulations, we conducted an in-depth analysis of the ion transport mechanisms and key influencing factors of two typical SSEs, Li₆PS₅Cl and Li₃YCl₆. The study reveals that S/Cl anion disorder levels and Na/Li arrangements significantly affect the connectivity of lithium-ion diffusion pathways. For instance, in Li₆PS₅Cl, an S/Cl disorder level of approximately 40%-50% can form a continuous diffusion network, significantly enhancing ionic conductivity; however, excessively high disorder levels disrupt pathway connectivity, leading to a decline in conductivity. Similarly, in the NaxLi₃₋ₓYCl₆ system, increasing lithium content expands diffusion channels and introduces local disorder, lowering migration energy barriers and thereby improving ionic conductivity. These findings provide theoretical guidance for enhancing SSE performance through structural optimization and reveal the combined influence of crystal structure, coordination networks, and local distortions on ion transport behavior. Looking ahead, the potential applications of uMLIPs models in materials science are vast, but some key challenges remain to be addressed. First, improving the computational capabilities of models under extreme conditions (e.g., high pressure, high temperature, or electrochemical cycling) is crucial for achieving their widespread application. Second, integrating multi-scale modeling methods (e.g., coupling molecular dynamics with continuum mechanics) can provide a more comprehensive description of the actual dynamic behavior of SSEs. Additionally, by incorporating more diverse training data (e.g., systems containing rare earth elements and complex crystal structures), the generalization ability of models in unseen chemical spaces can be enhanced, supporting the discovery and optimization of new materials. Ultimately, with the continuous improvement of machine learning tools, uMLIPs will play a pivotal role in the development of next-generation energy materials, laying the groundwork", "page": 23, "position": 1}
