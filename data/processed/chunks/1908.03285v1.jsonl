HOMO level of solvent molecules has been successfully used for understanding trends in their oxidative stability but assumes a non-interacting environment. However, solvent HOMO levels are renormalized due to molecules in their solvation shells. In this work, we ﬁrst demonstrate an inexpensive and accurate method to determine the HOMO level of solvent followed by simple descriptors for renormalization of HOMO level due to diﬀerent electrolyte components. The descriptors are based on Gutmann Donor and Acceptor numbers of solvent and other components. The method uses fast GGA-level DFT calculations compared to previously used expensive, experimental data dependent methods. This method can be used to screen for unexplored stable solvents among the large number of known organic compounds to design novel high voltage stable electrolytes. 1 arXiv:1908.03285v1 [physics.chem-ph] 8 Aug 2019", "page": 0, "position": 0}

To meet the requirement for electric vehicle and grid storage applications, we need batteries which can deliver higher speciﬁc energy and energy density at cell level. To achieve such high speciﬁc energy and energy density, two major approaches have been employed to improve the current cathode: 1) Use of high voltage cathode materials such as layered LiNixMnyCozO2 (NMC), spinel oxides such as LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 and poly-anion materials with Ni and Co cations such as LiCoPO4, LiNiSO4F, LiCoPO4F, etc.1,2 and 2) Use of high capacity conversion cathodes mainly S and O2.3–6 One of the major factors limiting the use of high voltage cathode materials has been the lack of electrolytes which are stable against oxidation at these high cathode potentials.7–9 Li-O2 batteries are also signiﬁcantly aﬀected by solvent degradation resulting from reactions with Li2O2 and O− 2 existing in the cathode and electrolyte respectively.10,11 The solvents oxidative stability is dependent on the environment including the all the electrolyte species and electrode surfaces.12,13 Additives added to the electrolyte to form a good SEI at the anode, for non-ﬂammability and increasing ionic conductivity inﬂuence the solvation shell of the solvent molecules. Thus while designing new solvents and additives, we need to be ensure the additives do not aﬀect the solvent’s oxidative stability negatively. To search for new electrolyte components that are stable against oxidation, we need a fast and reliable method based on simple descriptors. Oxidative stability of a molecule is primarily dependent on the relative position of its highest occupied molecular orbital level (HOMO) to the chemical potential of the cathode.7 HOMO level of the molecule speciﬁcally refers to the HOMO level in presence of molecule’s neighbouring environment which includes the solvation species and the cathode surface.12 Recent work has shown that for various battery electrolytes, oxidation involves interactions between multiple species such as the anions and other solvent molecules implying that the sol- vent’s HOMO is renormalized under solvation.14–16 Thus studying this renormalization due", "page": 1, "position": 0}

Previous literature has used Quantum chemistry (QC) meth- ods,22,23 coupled cluster theory (CCSD(T)),24,25 GW method13,18 and DFT calculations em- ploying polarizable continuum model for determining oxidative stability of electrolytes.17,26 These methods are either computationally expensive or require input parameters such as di- electric constant, cavity size, molar volumes and experimental Gibbs solvation energies.27–29 Here, we use simple GGA level DFT calculations and model solvation explicitly to determine the relation between the renormalization of the HOMO level of the solvent and the Gutmann Donor number (DN)30 and Acceptor number (AN)31 of the components in the electrolyte. Our method is computationally inexpensive and only relies on Donor and Acceptor number measurements compared to other methods. To identify new stable solvents, we ﬁrst calculate the ionization potential of solvent with GGA-level DFT calculations. Using the model rela- tion along with Donor and Accepetor numbers of solvents, salts and additives, we can easily estimate the renormalization of solvent’s HOMO level in a given solvation environment. Our current method provides an easy way to incorporate electrolyte stability in high-throughput computational screening.9,32 HOMO level is computed as the negative of the ionization potential (IP) as given by the Koopman’s theorem.33 Self-Consistent DFT calculations were used to compute the IP of diﬀerent solvent molecules with and without solvation. DFT calculations were done using the real space projector-augmented wave method as implemented in the GPAW code.34,35 For all calculations, the converged force was < 0.05 eV/˚Aand a Fermi smearing of 0.01 eV was used. Based on the calculations done by Rostgaard et. al., DFT energies of the neutral and charged solvent molecules can used to calculate IPs of solvents and solvated complexes with an accuracy better than the GW and MP2 methods which are very expensive computationally.36 We use PBE exchange correlation functional37 for the DFT calculations as it provides the highest accuracy in predicting IPs of the simulated list of solvents.

IP = EDFT(S+) −EDFT(S) (1) To validate the accuracy of our method of calculating IP, we calculated IPs for 34 solvents from the Stenutz dataset, with known experimental IPs. The DFT derived IPs agree well with the experimental values with a mean absolute error(MAE) of 0.12 eV as shown in Fig. 2. Thus, this method should yield reliable estimates for IP of diﬀerent molecules and complexes. The next step is to calculate the IP of solvent in the solvation environment of cations and anions. As discussed before, it is known that the oxidative stability is reduced primarily due to anions and we will focus on this eﬀect in this work.22 We have considered two cases, (1) The solvent is solvated by a single anion and (2) the solvent is solvated by the Li-anion ion pair. The complex of the given solvent-anion pair was constructed such that the geometry maximized the interaction between the negatively charged atoms of the anion and the acidic hydrogen atoms of the solvent molecule. This conﬁguration was chosen because it has been shown previously that the anion-solvent interaction is primarily dominated by H-bond in- teractions.38 For the solvent-ion pair complex, the conﬁguration considered had the same solvent-anion structure with Li+ added on the other side of the solvent. The complex struc- ture was relaxed in a 10 ˚A in all directions. A positive charge was placed on the complex and it was allowed to relax. As mentioned above, the energy diﬀerence of neutral and charged complex gave IP of complex. Bader charge analysis39 was performed on the posi- tively charged complex to conﬁrm the oxidation of the solvent or the anion. To determine the partial charges, the vacuum charge density was set to zero in the Bader analysis. If the solvent is oxidized, then the renormalization is calculated as the diﬀerence in the IP of the the molecule and the solvated complex. Otherwise, the diﬀerence is calculated with respect to the IP of the anion.", "page": 4, "position": 0}

By deﬁnition, the IP of the anion is negative of the electron aﬃnity(EA) of the corresponding neutral specie. We ﬁnd that the EAs compare well with experimental results as shown in Table 1. The IP of the anions is lower than all the considered solvents, which implies that the anions would likely oxidize much earlier than the solvent. However, the corresponding Li+-anion ion pairs are more stable against oxidation compared to the solvents as seen in Table 1. Hence in general cations in the solvation shell will result in increase of oxidative stability of the molecule. The considered anions probably exist as ion-pairs and hence will be more stable against oxidation compared to the solvents.41 For the Bader analysis, we consider the solvent completely oxidized if it has a net charge on it is greater than 0.6 and the anion completely oxidized if the charge on the anion is less than -0.4. All other cases are treated as co-oxidation of the anion and the solvent. Most anion ion-pairs oxidize before water and methanol due to their high ionization potentials, while in other cases solvents oxidize before the Li-anion ion-pairs. The calculated IP for the Li+-SCN−ion pair is lower than most of the solvents considered and hence SCN−is oxidized before the solvent. For the cases where there is solvent oxidation, we expect that donacity of anions should help stabilize the oxidized solvent molecule and hence make oxidation more favorable.

We also see that for a given salt, solvents with higher AN have larger reduction in IP. Thus, we can conclude that the DN of the anion and the AN of the solvent are strongly correlated to the oxidative stability of the solvent. Now to quantify the extent of this eﬀect of renormalization due to solvation and avoid further DFT calculations, we explore two simple models based on these descriptors. For the ﬁrst model, we assume that the renormalization is a simple linear function of the AN and DN given by: RNHOMO = C + α(DN) + βAN (2) The second model is based on a geometric mean of the interaction strength. Here we assume that the renormalization is proportional to the electrostatic interaction energy between the two species. The DN is the electron donating tendency of a molecule and is related to the negative partial charge of the molecule. Similarly the AN is related to the positive partial charge of the molecule. Then the interaction energy could be correlated to the product of the DN and AN of the corresponding species. Among the considered models, geometric mean, given by: RNHOMO = C + α √ AN × DN (3) gives the best ﬁt for the data. The coeﬃcients for these models were trained using 32 DFT calculations covering binary combinations of 6 salts and 6 solvents mentioned earlier. Note that the salt and solvents cover a signiﬁcant range of the known AN and DN space. Surprisingly, both models as shown in Fig. 4, perform equally well with an R2 of 0.86 and a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.16 eV. The goodness of the ﬁt with experimental AN and DN also proves that for all the binary salt and solvent combinations, the number of species in the solvation shell of the salt anions is not signiﬁcantly diﬀerent. An advantage of building such a simple descriptor-based model is that now we can 8", "page": 7, "position": 0}

Using the models, we also derive a contour plot for easily calculating the renormalization as a function of the AN and DN of the respective species as shown in Fig. 5. In the standard Li-ion battery electrolyte comprising of EC and LiPF6, the PF− 6 would reduce EC’s stability by 0.65 V and another EC molecule will reduce it by 1.14 V. These values are very close to the ones calculated using Quantum Chemistry based methods.12,22 We have shown in an earlier work that larger DN of the electrolyte salt anion and larger AN of the solvent leads to increased solvation and in turn increased solubility of the Li salt.41,42 However, we ﬁnd that this leads to a reduction in oxidative stability of the solvent. 10", "page": 9, "position": 0}

So, to avoid the issue of reduction in stability, it is necessary to use low AN solvents such as ethers, esters, carbonates, etc and low DN salts such as LiPF6, LiTFSI, etc. This now provides a rational basis for modifying electrolyte constituents in current Li-ion batteries. In the context of Li-O2 batteries, the stability of the solvent will also be aﬀected by the superoxide anion (O− 2 ) which is generated during the discharge and charge processes. The DN of O− 2 anion is expected to be greater than that of OCN−(40 kcal/mol). Now using the model, we estimate that a O− 2 molecule would reduce oxidative stability of solvents by 1.25-1.75 V.

In battery literature, stabilities are measured on the Li/Li+. As shown before, the Li/Li+ redox potential also shifts by ∼0-0.75 V depending on the eﬀective DN of the electrolyte mixture. This is another degree of freedom to expand the stability window of the electrolyte. To summarize, we have identiﬁed simple descriptors to determine the inﬂuence of solva- tion on the oxidative stability of various electrolyte components. Our model can be used to quickly determine the oxidative stability of the electrolyte mixture once the DN (Lewis Basicity), AN (Lewis Acidity) and the IP of the individual components is determined. This method does not depend on other experimental measurements and hence can be used to evaluate unexplored solvent and salt molecules if we can develop a method to eﬃciently compute the DN and AN from ﬁrst principles. We also believe utilizing a similar concept, it is possible to describe renormalization from the cathode surface as a function of the surface charge of the cathode surface.21 We will explore this in a future study and complete the model for solvent stability against cathodes. Using our work we propose low AN and high DN solvents, low DN salts with low crystallization energies for getting high voltage stability while maintaining suﬃcient solubility of the Li salt.
