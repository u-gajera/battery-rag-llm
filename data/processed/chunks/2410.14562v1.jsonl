Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations incorporating the Hubbard U correction reveal that NH+ 4 -V2O5 is an antiferromagnetic insulator with an energy gap of 1.97 eV. The introduction of NH+ 4 ions into the V2O5 structure results in significant structural distortions, leading to the formation of magnetic vanadium ions (V4+, 3d1) and non-magnetic ions (V5+, 3d0). The magnetic vanadium ions are organized into chains with antiferromagnetic order along the a-axis. Our findings indicate that NH+ 4 -V2O5 exhibits strong electron correlation effects and negligible interchain mag- netic interactions, rendering it a promising candidate for a one-dimensional magnetic van der Waals system. This work provides insights into the electronic and magnetic behaviors of NH+ 4 -V2O5, with implications for its potential applications in energy storage technologies. I. INTRODUCTION Aqueous zinc-ion batteries have gained significant at- tention [1, 2] for their safety, cost-effectiveness, and en- vironmental friendliness, and V2O5 has emerged as a promising cathode material due to its high capacity and favorable intercalation properties [3–5]. Recent stud- ies have shown that modifying V2O5 through intercala- tion with various ions [6, 7], including ammonium [8], can enhance its structural stability and electrochemi- cal performance, making it a strong candidate for high- performance zinc-ion batteries.

A recent paper by Y. Wang et al.

It was obtained that the charge transfer, Zn-ion diffusion barrier, and the electrostatic interaction with Zn ions ob- viously dropped in NH+ 4 -V2O5 revealing effective accel- erated electron transfer and Zn-ion migration. Authors demonstrate that the appearance of ammonia ions in the layered structure of V2O5 induce variations in the elec- tronic structure of host material that result in the partial occupation of V t2g subshell. The emergence of a partially filled d-subshell of the transition metal ion serves as a direct indicator of the existence of electron correlations effects. It could lead to electron localization on specific sites and subsequently give rise to magnetic or orbital ordering. In the present study, we explored the electronic and magnetic struc- ture of NH+ 4 -V2O5 using the DFT+U approach, which ∗dmitry@korotin.name FIG. 1. Relaxed crystal structure of NH+ 4 -V2O5.

METHODS All calculations were performed using the plane-wave (PW) pseudopotential implementation of the DFT con- tained in the Quantum ESPRESSO distribution [11, 12]. We used pseudopotentials from the standard solid-state pseudopotential library set with the exchange-correlation functional in the PBEsol form (SSSP PBEsol Precision v1.3.0) [13]. The energy cutoff for the plane wave func- tion and charge density expansion was set to 80 Ry and 600 Ry, respectively. The reciprocal space integration was performed on a regular 4 × 2 × 8 k point mesh in the irreducible part of the Brillouin zone. Grimme’s D3 dispersion correction method [14] with three body terms was used to describe the van der Waals interactions. The crystal structure was optimized with a convergence threshold for total energy of < 10−5 Ry, for forces of < 10−3 Ry/Bohr, and for pressure of < 0.2 kbar. Calculations were done for the cell containing four for- mula units, i.e. the primitive cell doubled in the [100] direction. The DFT+U method in the Dudarev formulation [15] with the Ueff value of 3.2 eV [9, 16] for the vanadium d shell was used for all calculations. The value of the Hubbard U parameter was chosen based on established values from the literature for vanadium oxide systems. For example, in pristine V2O5, a U of 3.1 eV has been employed by matching calculated and experimental oxi- dation enthalpies[17]. For Li-intercalated vanadium pen- toxide, a value of 4.0 eV is commonly used[18, 19]. While it is possible to compute U self-consistently, such calcu- lations can be sensitive to local structural parameters, as noted by Timrov et al. [20], and are resource-intensive. In this work, we focused on the key qualitative features of the system, including magnetic ordering, insulating behavior, and the mixed valence states of the vanadium ions. These features are largely insensitive to the precise value of U, as any U greater than 1 eV is sufficient to open a band gap and induce magnetic ordering in the considered system due to the narrow dxy peak in the vanadium density of states, as demonstrated below.

III. RESULTS In stoichiometric V2O5, the vanadium ion has a for- mal electronic configuration of d0. The quasi-two- dimensional crystal structure consists of edge- and corner-sharing VO5 pyramids forming layers perpendic- ular to the (001) direction [21]. If you take the crystal structure of NH+ 4 -V2O5 shown in Fig. 1 and ignore the NH+ 4 ions, you get a schematic view of the pure V2O5. In the crystal c-direction, the atomic layers are weakly bonded, presumably by van der Waals interactions. In the square pyramid environment, the atomic d-level of V splits into four sublevels (from the lowest to the high- est): dxy, dxz,yz, dx2−y2, and d3z2−r2. These sublevels are formally unoccuped. An extra electron appearing in the cell after ammonia ion intercalation will occupy the low- est level above the Fermi energy, dxy, since the nitrogen and hydrogen energy bands are far below and above the Fermi level. The usual GGA and LDA exchange correlation func- tionals lead to an averaging of occupations of all V-dxy orbitals in the cell due to the self-interaction error and underestimation of the Coulomb interaction effect. Con- sequently, the simplest DFT calculation gives a metal- lic electronic structure for NH+ 4 -V2O5. If the DFT+U method is applied with spin polarization, but the sym- metry of the system is not lowered, the extra electron from the NH+ 4 ion is again shared between the two V ions in the crystal cell, resulting in a half-filled dxy spin orbital and a metallic solution. The most unrestricted strategy, namely utilizing the DFT+U technique with disabled crystal symmetry and complete relaxation of atomic positions, might cause the electron to localize on just one of the two V-dxy", "page": 1, "position": 1}

The most unrestricted strategy, namely utilizing the DFT+U technique with disabled crystal symmetry and complete relaxation of atomic positions, might cause the electron to localize on just one of the two V-dxy orbitals. This could produce an insulating band structure and induce magnetic moments on the vanadium atoms. We considered five different possible positions of the ammonia ions in the stoichiometric V2O5 (see Supple- mental Materials [22]). After full relaxation of the cell, the lowest enthalpy has the structure shown in Fig. 1. The ammonia ions in NH+ 4 -V2O5 are in the 4e Wyckoff position of the Pmmn space group of V2O5. Following this structural analysis, we calculated the formation energy of NH+ 4 -V2O5 by comparing the to- tal energy of the fully relaxed NH+ 4 -V2O5 structure with those of the isolated NH+ 4 cation and pristine V2O5. The formation energy of -4.38 eV indicates that NH+ 4 incorpo- ration into V2O5 is energetically favorable, suggesting a stable configuration for the ammonium-intercalated ma- terial. Notably, this value is more negative than the formation energy of Zn2+ ion intercalation into pris- tine V2O5 [9], further highlighting that the ammonia- intercalated structure provides a more stable host mate- rial for Zn-ion batteries. Further insights into the structural effects of NH+ 4 in- corporation are provided in Table I, which shows the dif- ferences in cell volume and lattice parameters between V2O5 and NH+ 4 -V2O5. The 37% increase in cell volume is primarily driven by the expansion of the interlayer dis- tance from 4.37 ˚Ato 5.98 ˚A. The obtained interlayer distance is smaller than the experimental estimate by 10.69 ˚A, as reported in the study [9]. We suggest that this discrepancy is due to tem- perature effects and possible structural defects present in the samples studied by the authors. Nevertheless, the expansion of the interlayer spacing upon the addition of ammonium", "page": 1, "position": 2}

After the NH+ 4 ion insertion two different types of VO5 pyramids appeared: one with a polyhedral volume of 4.85 ˚A3 (these are the pyramids around the V0 ion in Fig. 1) and another with a polyhedral volume of 5.28 ˚A3 (pyramids around the V1 and V2 ions in Fig. 1). Even from a structural point of view, the formation of the two different types of vanadium ions is clearly seen. This finding will be supported below by an analysis of the electronic structure. The partial densities of states for the two types of vana- dium ions, called V0 and V1 in Fig. 1, are shown in Fig. 2. It can be seen that the calculation within the DFT+U approach leads to an insulating solution with an energy gap value of almost 2 eV. The electronic states below the -3 eV energy level are mainly formed by the p states of the oxygen ions with a small mixture of V-d states. The electronic states above the Fermi level are generally the V-d states with an admixture of the O-p. The most notable feature of the DOS is a sharp peak just below the Fermi level.

This indicates that the magnetic moment on the V1 ion is formed by capturing an electron from the ammonium ion and localizing it in the dxy orbital. In contrast, the V0 ion remains nearly non-magnetic. The partial DOS for the V2 ion is not shown, as our results indicate that V1 and V2 are structurally and electroni- cally equivalent, with their magnetic moments arranged antiferromagnetically. The calculated band structure of NH+ 4 -V2O5, shown in Fig. 3, reveals an ultra-narrow energy band just below the Fermi level, corresponding to the half-filled dxy orbitals of the V1 and V2 ions. Finally, the lowest-energy electronic and magnetic con- figuration of NH+ 4 -V2O5 is as follows: after ammo- nia ion intercalation, half of the V ions remain in the 3d0 (V5+) electronic configuration, making them non- magnetic. The other half adopt a 3d1, S = 1 2 magnetic configuration (V4+). These magnetic ions form linear chains along the a crystal axis, separated by chains of non-magnetic V ions along the b axis (see Fig. 1). Within the chains of magnetic ions, the magnetic moments are antiferromagnetically ordered. The arrangement of these magnetic ion chains is clearly visualized in the magnetization density isosurface (ρup − ρdown), as shown in Fig. 4. The isosurface exhibits the shape of dxy orbitals localized on the V1 and V2 ions. Along the a axis, an alternation of magnetization sign is observed, reflecting the antiferromagnetic ordering", "page": 2, "position": 1}

This is the picture we see in Fig. 4 along the a direction. To be fully confident in the result obtained, we have calculated the total energies of the cell for differ- ent magnetic moments orderings within and between the chains of magnetic ions. The corresponding total energies are summarized in Table II. The obtained magnetization densities for all four possible arrangements are shown in Supplemental Materials Fig. S2 [22]. The table shows that the chains of magnetic ions prac- tically do not interact along the b direction. To change the lowest interchain FM ordering to AFM would require only 0.02 meV per formula unit. However, 3.66 meV are required to change the magnetic ordering within the chain along the a direction. Using the mean-field approx- imation and neglecting interchain interactions, we esti- mated the N´eel temperature to be approximately 85 K. One might expect the energy difference between paral- lel and antiparallel ordering of magnetic moments across chains to be minimal, assuming negligible interaction be- tween chains, irrespective of the intrachain magnetic con- figuration. However, as shown in Tab. II, this is not the case when the ions within the chain are ferromag- netic.

This can be observed from the magnetization density isosurface in Fig. S2 (c) and the magnetic moments listed in Tab. S2. The mag- netic moment of the V0 ion increases from 0.12 µB in the AFM-intrachain FM-interchain case to 0.16 µB in the FM-intrachain FM-interchain case. This additional magnetic moment contributes to the total energy of the system, leading to the notable energy difference seen in the last two rows of Tab. II. IV. CONCLUSION In this study, we employed Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations on NH+ 4 -V2O5, a candidate material for a cathode in zinc-ion batteries. By incorporating the Hubbard U correction to account for strong electronic correlations, which increases the localization of valence electrons, and allowing for full relaxation of the crystal symmetry, we identified NH+ 4 -V2O5 as an antiferromag- netic insulator with an energy gap of 1.97 eV. Our analysis indicates that the vanadium ions in NH+ 4 - V2O5 exhibit mixed valence states. Half of the vanadium ions remains in a 3d0 (V5+) non-magnetic state, while the other half adopts a 3d1 (V4+) configuration with localized electrons on the dxy orbital, forming magnetic moments. The magnetic vanadium ions are organized into linear chains along the a-axis with antiferromagnetic order. It is important to note that our findings suggest neg- ligible magnetic interactions between chains along the b-axis and no interaction between layers along the c- axis. This spatially confined magnetic interaction in- dicates that NH+ 4 -V2O5 is a promising candidate for a one-dimensional magnetic van der Waals system, which could be advantageous for applications requiring reduced dimensionality and strong anisotropic magnetic proper- ties.
