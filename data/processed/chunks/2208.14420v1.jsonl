This work provides in-depth insights into the high-performance DRX-Li3V2O5 anode, and paves the way to the discovery of other disordered anode materials. Introduction Rocksalt oxides have been extensively studied as electrodes for rechargeable lithium-ion batteries (LIBs).1 As the name implies, the O – 2 anions in rocksalt oxides are arranged in a close-packed face-centered-cubic (fcc) framework, with the cations occupying the tetrahedral and octahedral interstitial sites, as shown in Figure1(a). For instance, the common layered transition metal (M) oxide LiMO2 cathode used in LIBs is formed by an ordered arrangement of Li and M in this framework. In the past decade or so, lithium-rich disordered rocksalt (DRX) oxides have emerged as a promising class of alternative electrode materials with extraordinarily high speciﬁc capacities and high rate capabilities.1–4 While DRX materials have been extensively studied as cathodes, relatively few have been explored as anodes.5–7 Among the most promising is the DRX-Li3V2O5 recently reported by Liu et al. 5. The DRX-Li3V2O5 anode operates at a near-optimal average voltage of ∼0.6 V vs Li/Li+ - high enough to alleviate the safety concerns attributed to Li plating that occurs during fast charge/discharge of the commercial graphite anode used in LIBs. At the same time, it is substantially lower than the 1.5 V operating voltage of lithium titanate, thereby yielding a much higher energy density. Despite its great promise, there remains major ambiguity on the intercalation chemistry of DRX-Li3V2O5. Previously, Zheng et al.8 proposed that the related DRX-Li0.78+xV0.75O2 anode undergoes a conversion-type reaction, in which the single phase material converts to VO2 and Li2O as it is discharged to 0.55 V vs Li/Li+. However, previous density functional theory (DFT) calculations by the present authors attributed the low voltage and high rate capability of DRX-Li3V2O5 to a redistributive lithium intercalation mechanism with low 2", "page": 1, "position": 0}

In this work, we revisit the intercalation chemistry of the DRX-Li3+xV2O5 (0 ≤x ≤2)) at ﬁnite temperatures using large-scale simulations with machine-learned energy models. Monte Carlo simulations using a ﬁtted cluster expansion model predict that Li primarily inserts into the tetrahedral sites of DRX-Li3V2O5 while Li occupancy in octahedral sites remains largely unchanged, in contrast with earlier DFT results. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations using a machine learning interatomic potential reveal that Li+ diﬀusivity reaches the maximum at intermediate states of charge, but sharply decreases at the start of charge/discharge. The exceptionally high rate capability and superior cycling stability of DRX-Li3V2O5 anode are a result of facile diﬀusion of Li ions through tetrahedral - octahedral - tetrahedral pathway, consistent with previous nudged elastic band calculations. Methods Structure model Figure 1(a) shows the crystal structure of DRX-Li3+xV2O5, which has an fcc lattice with spacegroup Fm¯3m. The O2– anions occupy 4a sites. The initial composition of Li3V2O5 has a cation: anion ratio of 1:1. Based on our previous studies, the lowest DFT energy structure is one where all Li/V cations fully occupy the octahedral 4b sites.5 Henceforth, we will use the anion-normalized composition, e.g., [Li0.6V0.4]octO for Li3V2O5, to emphasize the site occupancies. During discharge, inserted Li+ also occupy the tetrahedral 8c sites, forming Li tet x [LiyV0.4]octO. For more costly DFT and climbing image nudged elastic band (NEB) calculations, a set of 64 special quasi-random structures (SQSs)9 with formula Li19V13O32 (corresponding to [Li0.59375V0.40625]octO) were generated using 2 × 2 × 2 supercells of the conventional rocksalt 3", "page": 2, "position": 0}

A Li site occupancy analysis of DFT ground states structures (Figure 2(b)) indicates that redistribution of Li from octahedral sites to tetrahedral sites occurs at x ∼0.75, where the occupancy of Lioct sharply decreases to 0.1 and the occupancy of Litet increases to 0.65. These results are qualitatively in line with previous DFT studies.5 However, this redistribution of Li is accompanied by a considerably large volume change (∼20%) and lattice distortion, contradicting with the experimental observations that the anode retains a stable cubic lattice with a small volume change of 5.9%.5 In contrast, the Li site occupancy analysis of metastable cubic phases (Figure 2 (c)) suggests that a redistribution of Li only takes place at the end of charging.

The Li insertion into 0-V sites is the most energetically favourable and the four neighboring Lioct sites are displaced oﬀ-center by 0.4-0.5 ˚A due to the electrostatic repulsion between Li+ (Figure 5(b)).

The neighboring Li atoms are pushed 0.5 - 0.6 ˚A away from the center of the octahedron, causing large distortions in the local lattice structure. The migration of V vacancies between neighboring octahedral sites was also investigated by introducing one V oct vacancy in the conﬁguration with the lowest V oct vacancy energy. The average V oct migration barrier is extremely high, up to 2100 meV (Figure S1). This suggests that V ions in DRX-Li3V2O5 are unlikely to migrate during charge/discharge under operating conditions. Figure 5 (c) shows the calculated voltage proﬁle by GCMC simulations. The GCMC- predicted voltage proﬁle exhibits a solid solution-like behavior and is in good agreement with the experimentally-measured voltage proﬁle.5 Li starts to insert into DRX-Li3V2O5 at ∼1.43 V and the predicted voltage proﬁle exhibits two voltage steps at around 0.9 and 0.25 V vs Li/Li+. As the voltage decreases to 0.01 V, the predicted average composition of the lithiated anode is Li5.11V2O5, close to that observed in experiments (Li4.86V2O5).5 In contrast, due to the limited supercell sizes used, DFT", "page": 15, "position": 0}

It should be noted that as an anode, insertion of Li into the DRX-Li3V2O5 corresponds to the charging process in a typical Li-ion battery. As Li ions are introduced into the tetrahedral sites, the Li occupancy in the octahedral sites ﬁrst remains constant at around 0.6 until x ≈0.3, following which there is a small, gradual reduction in Lioct occupancy. The insertion of Li ions into the tetrahedral sites consists of two steps. Li+ ﬁrst intercalate into 0-V sites, which is consistent with the energies predicted by DFT calculations (Figure5 (a)) and previous results that the insertion into 0-V tetrahedral sites is the most energetically favorable.5 This process coincides with the formation of the ﬁrst plateau at around 0.9 V on the voltage proﬁle. At x = 0.31, 0-V sites are fully occupied and further lithiation insertion occurs in the energetically less favorable 1-V and 2-V sites. The occupancy of 1-V and 2-V sites rise to ∼0.1 till the end of charge. At the end of charge, only ∼0.1% 3-V tetrahedral sites are occupied, and all 4-V sites are vacant. Validation of moment tensor potential The mean absolute errors (MAEs) of training energies and forces (shown in Figure 6) of the ﬁtted MTP are 3.15 meV/atom and 0.15 eV/˚A, respectively, comparable to those of other MTPs in the literature.41,42 As shown in Table 1, the MTP is able to accurately reproduce the lattice parameters and densities of training structures, with errors of within ± 3.12% and ± 4.42% relative to DFT values, respectively. Diﬀusion properties MD simulations were carried out to investigate the Li+ diﬀusion in the DRX-Li3+xV2O5 anode as a function of Li concentration using the ﬁtted MTP potential.

At the start of lithiation, a sharp increase in DLi+ to ∼10−9 cm2 s−1 with a corresponding decrease in Ea from 450 meV to 280 meV is observed up to x = 0.5. However, further lithiation results in a gradual decrease in DLi+ from ∼10−9 cm2 s−1 to ∼10−11 cm2 s−1 accompanied by an increase in Ea from 280 to 460 meV. We further analyzed the Li+ trajectories from 1 ns MD simulations at 600 K and the results for selected conﬁgurations are presented in Figure 7 (b). For x < 1.5, Li+ ions migrate via a cooperative tetrahedral - octahedral - tetrahedral (“t-o-t”) mechanism, in agreement with previous NEB calculations.5 For x > 1.5, the increased amount of inserted Li+ in tetrahedral sites and vacancies in octahedral sites may result in Li+ migration between neighboring tetrahedral - tetrahedral (“t-t”) sites via the vacant octahedral sites along with the “t-o-t” migration. To conﬁrm the above results, DFT NEB calculations were also performed to calculate the Li+ migration barriers. Similar to the previous NEB calculations,5 a cooperative mech- anism of Li+ migration was considered, where the tetrahedral Li+ migrates to a neighboring octahedral site and the octahedral Li+ migrates into another neighboring tetrahedral site (Figure 7 (c)). Here, we consider cooperative migration that occurs between corner-sharing and opposing tetrahedral sites, given that migration between edge-sharing tetrahedral sites is extremely energetically unfavorable due to the close proximity of the Li during migration (Figure S8(c) and S9(c)). Figure7(d) shows the calculated Li+ migration barriers between connected 0-V/1-V sites. We note that migration from 2-V site to 0-V and 1-V sites are energetically downhill due to the large site energy diﬀerences (Figure S11). The cooperative migration of Li+ via opposing “t-o-t” paths exhibits the lowest calculated average energy barriers, ranging from 230 to 340 meV in 0-V and 1-V sites. The average energy barriers of Li+ transport through corner-sharing ’t-o-t’ pathways exhibit higher energy barriers of 334 to 628 meV. In general, the migration barriers of Li+ increase as more V atoms gather around the", "page": 18, "position": 0}

These results are in line with the activation energies obtained by MD simulations and previous theoretical studies5 that the facile migration of Li+ across opposing ’t-o-t’ pathways results in high rate capability of DRX-Li3+xV2O5 anode. In previous stud- ies,5 Li+ hopping via 0-V sites is the only mechanism that was considered while our results show that Li+ migration in 0-V, 1-V and 2-V sites is facile. Similar results have also been observed in LTO anodes that the transportation of Li+ in face-sharing octahedral-tetrahedral motif contributes to fast kinetics.43 Conclusions A major conclusion from this work is that the lithium insertion mechanism in Li3V2O5 depends greatly on the initial Li/V disorder. For highly ordered Li/V arrangements with lower energies, Li insertion occurs via a redistribution mechanism with the formation of highly distorted structures and accompanied by large volume changes. This is consistent with previous DFT results, but inconsistent with experimental observations for the DRX-Li3V2O5 electrode.5 In contrast, Li/V disorder leads to Li inserting primarily into the tetrahedral sites, while retaining a cubic-like structure with small volume changes. The MC-predicted voltage proﬁle based on this latter mechanism is also in much better agreement with the experimental voltage proﬁle. The Li+ insertion mechanism and transport depends on the local environment around each tetrahedral site and the distribution of sites. Our results show that Li+ in 0-V sites are the most energetically favorable and have the lowest migration barrier and ≥2-V sites are highly energetically unfavorable.

The highest experimentally-realized lithiation state is Li5V2O5 (∼Li1V0.4O), which approximately corresponds to the full occupancy of the most energetically favored 0-V sites and about 0.77 occupancy of the 1-V tetrahedral sites. Hence, we can surmise that the inability of DRX- Li3+xV2O5 to reach the theoretical V2+ limit of Li6V2O5 is due to the lack of low energy sites for further Li insertion. The above analysis suggest that one potential avenue to tune the electrochemical proper- ties of the DRX anode is by varying the Li:V ratio in [Li1–xVx]octO. Increasing the Li:V ratio would increase the fraction of 0-V/1-V tetrahedral sites, but at the price of increasing the V oxidation state and hence, the anode voltage. Conversely, lowering the Li:V ratio would decrease lithiation capacity but also decrease the anode voltage. The optimal ratio would depend on the speciﬁc application, for example, whether a high rate or a high energy density anode is prioritized.
