However, pristine graphene is not suitable for most electrochemical devices, where defect engineering is crucial for its performance. We demonstrate how boron doping of graphene can alter its reactivity, electrical conductivity and potential application for sodium and aluminium storage, with the emphasis on novel metal-ion batteries. Using DFT calculations, we investigate both the influence of boron concentration and the oxidation of the material, on the mentioned properties. It is demonstrated that the presence of boron in graphene increases its reactivity towards atomic hydrogen and oxygen-containing species, in other words, it makes B-doped graphene more prone to oxidation. Additionally, the presence of these surface functional groups significantly alters the type and strength of the interaction of Na and Al with the given materials. Boron-doping and oxidation of graphene is found to increase Na storage capacity of graphene by the factor of up to 4.

Introduction Graphene is a two-dimensional material with a graphite monolayer structure and sp2- hybridized carbon (C) atoms arranged in a honeycomb-like lattice [1,2]. Due to its characteristics, such as good electric conductivity and a large surface area, graphene has attracted interest as a potential anode material. However, the fact that it’s a zero-bandgap semiconductor, along with its chemical inertness, limits its application possibilities [3–7]. Therefore, the graphene lattice is usually changed by chemical doping or by introducing covalent bonds with certain chemical groups or even molecules [8,9]. It should, however, be noted that the defects in graphene can also occur spontaneously during synthesis, and they can be sometimes difficult to predict and control [10]. The simplest modification method of pristine is chemical doping by heteroatoms, which improves the properties of pristine graphene by improving the metal-surface interaction, and adsorption and charge transfer abilities [2,4,11,12]. Heteroatoms such as boron (B), nitrogen (N), sulfur (S), fluorine (F), and phosphorus (P) are frequently chosen for this purpose since they change the bandgap and the position of the Fermi level, which depends on their concentration [4,13]. Carbon-based materials, including graphene, are widely investigated as candidates for electrode materials in metal-ion batteries (MIBs). For MIBs, the strength and the nature of interactions of the metal (and/or metal-based ions) with electrode materials are essential. Novel types of MIBs focus on metals other than Li as the electroactive species, due to the problems associated with Li-ion batteries [14] and Li abundance in general. These other metals include Na and Al, as they have small mass and radius, and high abundance in Earth’s crust. Additionally, further advantages of Al are its three-electron redox property and low flammability. However, both Na and Al interact with pristine graphene relatively weakly [15], resulting in low voltages of hypothetical novel MIBs with graphene as the electrode material. Thus, chemical functionalization is needed to boost graphene’s Na and Al storage capacity. Some reports of Al-ion batteries, which use carbon-based electrodes can already be found in the literature [16,17]. Boron-doped graphene is an especially good candidate for doping of graphene since B-", "page": 1, "position": 0}

B-graphene also has, similarly to pristine graphene, a very low or non- detectable total magnetization [12,20]. For now, B-graphene has primarily found its place in energy-related applications, such as batteries and supercapacitors [21,22], but there are also studies where it is used as a gas and optical sensor material [23,24] and in the biomedical field of study [25]. For example, Ling and Mizuno used first-principles calculations to demonstrate that the sodiation of boron-doped graphene preserves its structural integrity, avoids formation of dendrites and allows for approx. 2 times the capacity of the graphite anode in Li-IB and approx. 2.5 times higher than hard carbon in Na-IB [26]. Recently, Yiqun et al. demonstrated that the cathode based on boron-doped reduced graphene oxide displays a high Al-storage capacity and outstanding long- term stability [27]. In this study, we continue our previous work [28], where it was shown that the introduction of dopants into oxidized graphene, or controlled oxidation of doped graphene can enhance Na storage capabilities of the material, with boron found to be a very suitable dopant for this purpose. Thus, we investigate the effects of different concentrations of boron as a dopant in graphene on its properties, which are of importance for electrochemical applications. First, we focus on the reactivity of the material towards H, O and OH, and next we investigate the adsorption of Na and Al onto bare and oxidized boron-doped graphene, to explore the possibility of using such modified graphene surfaces in novel energy storage devices. 2. Computational details In order to carry out the DFT calculations, open-source program packet Quantum ESSPRESO [29,30] was used. GGA and PBE functionals were used as part of this package. Since the adsorption of sodium and aluminium on graphene-based materials was investigated, dispersion interactions need to be included by utilizing DFT-D2 correction [31]. The kinetic energy cut-off of plane waves was set at 36 Ry and the density cut-off was set at 576 Ry. Spin polarization was included in all", "page": 2, "position": 0}

Boron-doped graphene was constructed by replacing one, two, or three carbon atoms with boron, obtaining graphene with 1.85, 3.70, or 5.56 at.% of B, respectively. To evaluate the stability of boron-doped graphene, the binding energy (Eb) of boron at the vacancy sites is used. The binding energy of the nth (n∈{1,2,3}) substitutionally introduced boron atom is calculated as: Eb(nth B) = E(C54−nBn) − E(C54−nBn−1) − E(B) (1) where E(C54−nBn) stands for the total energy of graphene doped with n atoms of B, E(C54−nBn−1) the total energy of graphene doped with n−1 atoms of B and a vacancy at the site where the nth B will be introduced, and E(B) the total energy of an isolated boron atom. Since the adsorption of atomic hydrogen, atomic oxygen, hydroxyl group on C54−nBn was also investigated, their corresponding adsorption energies (Eads) were calculated using the following formula: Eads(A) = Esubs+A – Esubs − EA (2) where Esubs+A, Esubs, and EA stand for total energies of the optimized adsorbate@substrate system, bare substrate (C54−nBn), and isolated adsorbate atom/group (A = H, O, or OH), respectively. The most stable O@C54−nBn and OH@C54−nBn structures were further used as models of oxidized C54−nBn. Finally, adsorption of Na and Al on bare C54−nBn and its oxidized forms (O@C54−nBn and OH@C54−nBn) were investigated, while the strength of their interaction with the substrate was estimated in terms of differential and integral adsorption energies. The differential adsorption energy (Eads,diff) was calculated as: Eads,diff (M) = Esubs+mM – Esubs+(m−1)M – EM (3) where “subs” can be C54−nBn, O@C54−nBn or OH@C54−nBn, while Esubs+mM stands for the total energy of the chosen substrate with m atoms of metal M adsorbed (i.e. m is the number of atoms M, M = Na or Al). Similarly, Esubs+(m−1)M stands for the total energy of the chosen substrate with m−1 atoms of metal M adsorbed.

Graphical representations of all the graphene structures in this paper were made using VESTA [33]. 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Graphene doping by boron Pristine graphene, C54, was used as a starting model. Its optimization resulted in C−C bond length of 1.43 Å, in agreement with previous studies [12,34,35]. B-doped graphene was modelled by replacing n carbon atoms by boron, as described in the Computational Details section. While the position of the first boron atom can be chosen arbitrarily, it is necessary to perform additional calculations to find the optimal positions of the second and the third boron atom relative to the first one, or the first and the second one, respectively. In the case of C52B2 systems, we find that energetically least stable configuration is the one where the two B atoms are next to each other (Fig. 1). The systems become more stable as the two B atoms separate, and the optimal structure corresponds to the state where they are one across of the other, on the opposite sides of the same C4B2 hexagon (Fig. 1). A similar pattern was found upon the introduction of the third boron atom – the dopant atoms are one across of the other, on the opposite sides of one hexagon, while it is optimal to have two boron atoms inside one hexagon. The first boron atom (the case of C53B) is found to incorporate into the graphene lattice with the binding energy of –12.90 eV and C−B bond length of 1.49 Å, in agreement with our previous studies [12,36]. When more B atoms are introduced, the binding energies follow the trend: Eb(1st B) < Eb(2nd B) < Eb(3rd B), i.e. the first B is bound the strongest. The differences in their Eb are up to 6.2%.

For the full range DOS plots please see Fig. S1. It is well known that pristine graphene is a semimetal with a zero-band gap [20]. This was also observed here, and it is also shown that doped models behave as conductors. This is very important for the materials’ potential electrochemical purposes.

When investigating H adsorption (Fig. 3, top), the C-top sites were found to be the most favourable ones. For the B-doped surfaces, carbon that is the closest to boron is the one where H prefers to adsorb. This is in agreement with some previous research [12,37]. We find that with the increment of boron percentage in the system, the H adsorption energy decreases, i.e. H is bound more strongly. For pristine graphene the energy of H adsorption is –0.79 eV, while for, C51B3 it’s –2.06 eV.

The preferred site is the bridge site, which in the case of pristine graphene implies the site between two carbon atoms. In the investigated cases of B-doped graphene the preferred bridge site is C−B bridge. The energy of adsorption behaves in the same way as for the H adoption – boron percentage and adsorption energies of O are negatively correlated, the lowest energy being –4.30 eV for O@C51B3. The adsorption of OH (Fig. 3, bottom) gave similar results as in previously done research [12] – OH is binding via creating a C−O bond in the case of pristine graphene, and a B−O bond in the case of C54−nBn. When there are two boron atoms in the model, the adsorption to each one of them gave similar results with the more stable one having the binding energy of –2.21 eV and B−O and O−H bond lengths of 1.52 Å and 0.98 Å, respectively. However, for the C51B3 structure, it is most favourable for the OH group to adsorb on top of the boron atom that is in the middle, obtaining the binding energy of –2.21 eV and the same bond lengths as in C52B2. It is also interesting to note that, unlike the cases where adsorption of H and O was investigated, the most stable model with adsorbed OH is not the C51B3 structure but C52B2. The bond lengths do not vary much when increasing the number of boron atoms. It is also noted that the re-hybridization from sp2 to sp3 occurs in all the cases upon H, O or OH adsorption, meaning that the models lose their initial planarity. Obviously, all the investigated adsorbates bind more strongly to B-doped graphene than to pristine graphene, with the strength of the interaction rising with B percentage. This means that the introduction of B into the graphene lattice results in enhanced reactivity of the material towards H, O and OH. The increased reactivity towards H is of significance for the possible applications of such materials for hydrogen", "page": 7, "position": 0}

The increased reactivity towards H is of significance for the possible applications of such materials for hydrogen production and storage. The adsorption energy of atomic hydrogen is used as one of the basic descriptors for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity of the material. In fact, metal-free substitutionally B-doped graphene (1.85 at.% of B) was previously demonstrated to have significantly higher HER activity compared to defective graphene and glassy carbon, with HER onset potential around −0.3 V vs. RHE (Reversible Hydrogen Electrode) [38]. This value agrees well with the calculated hydrogen binging energy on B-doped graphene (~ −2.1 eV, Fig. 3). Moreover, from the herepresented results, it is clear that the HER active sites are not the B site, but the carbon atoms adjacent to the dopant sites, whose activity is rendered by B incorporation into the graphene lattice.", "page": 7, "position": 1}

The adsorption trends of H, O and OH on C54−nBn models: the relationship between the adsorption energies and the number of boron atoms n in the system. For boron-containing models, the optimized adsorption structures are given for each system. On the other hand, enhanced reactivity of C54−nBn towards O-containing groups signals that boron doping makes graphene more prone to oxidation, i.e. that O-groups will be more stable on the surface containing B, than the pristine one. This is very important from the aspect of metal interaction with such surfaces, which is crucial for applications of materials in metal-ion batteries. It is known that the oxygen-containing groups on graphene can play a very important role in that case, allowing for stronger interaction of chosen metal with the surface [33,35]. However, there is a risk of the O-group interacting “too strongly” with the metal and detaching from the surface irreversibly. Therefore, the stabilization of O-groups on graphene by its doping with B could be a good strategy for better performance of graphene-based materials in metal-ion batteries. Another important question, when it comes to electrochemical applications, is the electrical conductivity of the material. The electronic structures of C54−nBn upon adsorption of H, O and OH are given in Fig. 4. It can be seen that oxidized forms of C54−nBn (i.e. C54−nBn with O and OH adsorbed) act as conductors, making them good candidate for further research.

Metal adsorption Sodium is known to adsorb on pristine graphene at the C6-hollow site, with the adsorption energy of −0.93 eV [15]. Aluminum also adsorbs to hollow site on pristine graphene, with the adsorption energy amounting to −1.09 eV [15]. The reported energies vary depending on the computational approach (especially the chosen dispersion correction) and the size of the supercell. Regarding the adsorption of Na onto an oxidized (nondoped) graphene it is known that Na can directly interact with OH group, resulting in its detachment from the basal plane and NaOH phase separation [39]. We confirm all the mentioned facts regarding pristine graphene here, and additionaly, investigate the adsorption of sodium and aluminum onto C54−nBn, O@C54−nBn and OH@C54−nBn. The calculated metal adsorption energies on pristine graphene are found to be −0.85 eV and −1.26 eV, for Na and Al, respectively. When it comes to OH@C54, we find that both Na and Al adsorption result in metal hydroxyde phase separation. On the other hand, for O@C54 there is no detachment of the O-group, and we find that the adsorption energy of Na is −1.54 eV, and of Al −3.84 eV. In case of C54−nBn, the metal can occupy various top, bridge, or hollow adsorption sites.

Here we have shown only the representatives of the three main groups of adsorption geometries. All optimized structures of Na and Al adsorption on the investigated (oxidized) B-doped graphenes can be found in SI, Figs. S2 and S3. Fig. 5. Examples of different outcomes of the metal adsorption on top of the obtained models, for the case of Al: Al adsorbed at O@C53B (left), Al at O@C51B3 (middle) and Al at non-oxidized C53B (right). The first outcome is the cases where the metal atom is adsorbed on the same side of the basal plane as O or OH. In these cases, the metal atom interacts directly with the oxygen-containing group. Most of the investigated systems behave like this. In the second outcome, adsorbed Al or Na is on the opposite side of the basal plane from oxygen. This was only found for C51B3 models with an adsorbed oxygen atom. It can be explained by the combination of high dopant concentration and the presence of O-group, which significantly alter the planarity and charge of the surface. Because of this, it is easier for the metal atom to approach the other side of the plane. In both cases, the adsorbed metal occupies a hollow site on the opposite side from Oads. This is similar to the case of Na adsorption on corrugated doped graphene [40]. The third outcome represent the cases where the new phase emerges upon the adsorption of the metal. This happens in three cases: Na@OH@pristine graphene, Al@OH@pristine graphene, and when OH is bounded on top of the C53B, after the adsorption of Al. Therefore, these new phases represent the formation of metal hydroxyde. These models were not considered further since the formation of a new phase is not favourable for electrochemical purposes.

Grey isosurfaces indicate charge loss, while the yellow ones indicate charge gain. The isosurface values are ±0.002 eV/Å. It can be clearly seen that in all the cases the metal atoms are the ones that lose their charge and transfer it either completely to the graphene basal plane (cases of non-oxidized surfaces), or partially to oxygen and partially to the basal plane (cases of oxidized surfaces). The only exception when it comes to the oxidized surfaces is the already mentioned M@O@C51B3 (Fig. 6, top right), where M adsorbs on the opposite side of the basal plane from O, so that no charge transfer from M to O is found. According to Löwdin charges, Na transfers 0.65-0.75 e to the substrate in all cases, while Al transfers 0.46-0.52 e to the substrate. In order to avoid forming a metal precipitate, the interaction energy between metal and substrate needs to be higher than the cohesive energies of metals [41]. Thus, one of the main points of interest was comparing the absolute value of calculated adsorption energies with cohesive energies of Na 1.113 eV atom–1, and Al 3.39 eV atom–1 [42,43], as in Fig. 7. It can be seen that in the case of sodium, only one system has an energy lower than the cohesive energy and that’s O@C54. On the other hand, for aluminium half of the systems, not counting the ones where a new phase emerges, do not fulfil this condition. This is intuitive since Al has higher cohesive energy compared to Na. The systems where the precipitation of Al does not occur are O@C54, O@C53B, O@C52B2, OH@C52B2, and OH@C51B3. For electrochemistry purposes “the intermediate” adsorption energy is the one that is preferable, meaning that it is high enough for metals not to precipitate but the adsorption is not so strong that it becomes irreversible.", "page": 11, "position": 0}

For the substrates without pre-adsorbed O or OH, the absolute value of the adsorption energies of the sodium and aluminium increases with the increment of boron atoms in the structure up to a point where there are two boron atoms, and then it decreases again, making the C52B2 model the one with the most exothermic adsorption energy for both metals. The same trend is observed for Na when O is pre-adsorbed on the surface. However, this is not the case for Al where the highest absolute value of the adsorption energy is for the O@C52B2 structure. When OH is bonded to the surface, for both metals the absolute value of the adsorption energy increases with the percentage of boron. Another important point is determining whether the systems are conducting. They need to be conducting to be used electrode materials.

Next, we investigated how the presence of boron dopant atoms in different concentrations, as well as the presence of O/OH groups on the surface, affect the adsorption capacity for Na and Al (Fig. 9). We compare the calculated differential adsorption energies of each added Na to its cohesive energy and find that up to 4 Na can be adsorbed onto C51B3, O@C53B and O@C52B2.

Conclusion DFT calculations were utilized to investigate the influence of boron dopant concentration and surface oxidation on the potential for Na and Al storage in graphene. The obtained results demonstrated that the introduction of boron into graphene has a significant effect on its reactivity towards oxygen-containing species, rendering the material more susceptible to oxidation. Consequently, when modeling such materials, it is crucial to consider the oxidation of the B centers. In terms of electrochemical applications, the oxidation of B-doped graphene modifies its electronic structure but does not induce a bandgap. As a result, controllable doping of graphene with boron, followed by oxidation, appears to be a promising approach for enhancing electrochemical performance with respect to Na and Al storage. Specifically, this strategy optimizes the strength of the interaction between Na and Al and the graphene surface and its storage capacity, thereby opening up possibilities for applications in metal-ion batteries and energy storage in general. In both cases, the adsorbate atoms tend to bind to or near B atoms, which are additionally functionalized by surface groups such as O or OH.", "page": 15, "position": 0}
