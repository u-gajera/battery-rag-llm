However, data-driven ex- ploration and design of amorphous materials is hampered by the absence of a com- prehensive database covering a broad chemical space. In this work, we present the largest computed amorphous materials database to date, generated from sys- tematic and accurate ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) calculations. We also show how the database can be used in simple machine-learning models to connect properties to composition and structure, here specifically targeting ionic conductiv- ity. These models predict the Li-ion diffusivity with speed and accuracy, offering a cost-effective alternative to expensive density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Furthermore, the process of computational quenching amorphous materials provides a unique sampling of out-of-equilibrium structures, energies, and force landscape, and we anticipate that the corresponding trajectories will inform future work in uni- versal machine learning potentials, impacting design beyond that of non-crystalline materials. 1 arXiv:2402.00177v1 [cond-mat.mtrl-sci] 31 Jan 2024", "page": 0, "position": 0}

Compared to the stringent synthesis requirements of crystalline materials for ordered atomic arrangement, synthesizing amorphous materials is less energy-intensive as it is often done via rapid quenching or cooling. Furthermore, the rate at which a material is cooled from a liquid to a solid state can influence the properties significantly[1]. Such tunability can be leveraged to engineer a wide range of physical, chemical, and mechanical properties. As examples, bulk metallic glasses with unique magnetic properties are found in high-efficiency transformers[2, 3], amorphous alkali-aluminosilicates were made famous as the world-leading cover glass for portable electronics[4], and amorphous 2D boron nitrides are proposed for the next-gen memory solutions due to their ultra-low dielectric constant combined with excellent electrical and mechanical properties[5, 6]. Amorphous materials are also considered for various applications in energy storage. For example, amorphous anodes, particularly silicon and silicon-tin alloys, are pursued as high-capacity, lower-cost alternatives to graphite. [7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13] Furthermore, the conformal nature of amorphous materials proffers major advantages in electrode coat- ing applications[14, 15, 16, 17] and as electrolytes for all-solid-state batteries. While crystalline Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) exhibits high Li-ion conductivity, it also suffers from lithium dendrite growth through the grain boundaries [18, 19, 20]. In comparison, amor- phous LLZO exhibits lower Li-ion diffusivity but shows marked improvement in safety and cyclability[21]. In contrast, amorphous lithium phosphorus oxynitride (LiPON) shows a higher Li-ion diffusivity than its crystalline counterpart[20, 22, 23], which indicates a possible design space where ionic conductivity and safety can be optimized within an 2", "page": 1, "position": 0}

Unfortunately, measuring ionic diffusivity in inorganic (amorphous or crystalline) ma- terials is highly time-consuming, and more often than not, the inherent bulk diffusivity is masked by other factors, such as pellet densification. It is possible to obtain an estimate of the ionic diffusivity through Ab Initio Molecular Dynamics (AIMD); however, in com- parison to crystalline compounds, amorphous materials require larger unit cells to capture sufficient and representative local environments. As of writing, the only reported database is the amorphous nanoporous materials database, which includes 75 amorphous carbons, 119 polymers, and 16 kerogens. The database is curated from earlier literature[24] and covers a limited range of compositions. To meet the need to accelerate our discovery and design of amorphous ionic conductors with optimized ionic diffusivity, in this study, we present an extensive, computed amorphous database covering 5120 compositions and 79 elements generated through systematic AIMD calculations. Additionally, we demon- strate the database’s applicability in simple yet highly efficient machine-learning models to rapidly and accurately predict Li diffusivity, providing a cost-effective alternative to density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The database also opens new possibilities for improving current directions in universal machine learning potentials by providing unique information about structure-energy-force relationships far from equilibrium con- figurations. Results and Discussion Data scope The amorphous database includes two subset databases. The first one consists of 5,120 compounds, which are melted at 5000K using the MPMorph workflow. Details about the workflow can be found in Methods section. This database is here denoted as the 3", "page": 2, "position": 0}

The second database is generated from the last snap- shot structures from the 5000K and annealed at 1000K, 1500K, 2000K, and 2500K for selected compositions. This database is denoted as the ‘multi-temperature amorphous database’. Among the 5,120 compositions in the 5000K amorphous database, 3,533 com- pounds contain lithium (SI Figure 1). Figure 1 presents the proportion of each element’s occurrence within the compositions in the 5000K amorphous database, compared to its occurrence within the Materials Project database. We note that the 5000K database ex- hibits extensive coverage, providing a similar representation of compositions compared to the Materials Project. The element occurrence of the compounds in the Materials Project is shown in SI Figure 2, where there are approximately 50,000 compounds containing Li. Similarly, the element occurrence in the compositions covered in the multi-temperature amorphous database is shown in SI Figure 3. SI Figure 4 shows the ratio of the element occurrence within the multi-temperature amorphous database compared to its occurrence within the Materials Project database. We find that the multi-temperature amorphous database also effectively captures a diverse range of material compositions, ensuring a comprehensive chemical representation. Correlations between Li+ diffusivity and composition Amorphous materials exhibit short-range ordering, which is strongly dependent on the composition. For example, amorphous Al2O3 exhibits a distribution of 4, 5, and 6-fold oxygen-coordinated Al3+ units, where the distribution depends on the synthesis or for- mation conditions. Since cationic diffusion in amorphous materials has been shown to be highly correlated and dependent on bond-formation/breaking events between the cation and its anionic environment[14, 15], we anticipate that Li+ diffusion in amorphous inor- ganic materials will correlate strongly to anion specie and composition.

In the context of data coverage, we emphasize that the samples obtained from the collected group may have different sizes. For instance, there is a higher number of com- pounds containing oxygen compared to those containing sulfur, selenium, and tellurium. Similarly, there is a greater presence of compounds with fluorine compared to compounds containing chlorine, bromine, and iodine. This is demonstrated in Figure 2 and Sup- plementary Information (SI) Figure 3. A small sample size may impact the accuracy in comparing different anion groups. Therefore, our analysis focuses on compounds with larger sample sizes, ensuring that the distributions are distinct enough to yield conclusive results. 5", "page": 4, "position": 1}

We make several observa- tions of Li ion diffusivity trends within different groups in the Periodic Table. Within the halogen group, compositions that include fluorine (F) demonstrate significantly lower diffusivity and higher activation energy (Ea) compared to those containing chlorine (Cl), bromine (Br), or iodine (I). Similarly, in the chalcogen group, compositions incorporat- ing oxygen (O) exhibit lower diffusivity and a higher Ea when compared to those that include sulfur (S). Compounds containing elements from group VA group have evenly distributed Ea due to the small sample size. Compounds with tin (Sn) have slightly lower Ea compared to those with silicon (Si). These trends all follow a similar pattern such that a larger atomic radius of the anion species – corresponding to elements from a larger row number within the same group – results in lower Li activation energy (Ea) and, thus, higher Li diffusivity. Correspondingly, higher electronegativity or higher charge density leads to stronger bonding between Li and anions, resulting in higher Ea for Li diffusion. The even distribution of activation energies (Ea) among compounds containing oxyanions, as shown in the bottom distribution, may be attributable to the small sample size. In addition to the correlation between anion species and Li diffusivity, the presence of other cations can also influence Li diffusivity. SI Figure 6 depicts the average Li diffu- sivity values from the 5000 K amorphous database across compounds containing specific elements from the periodic table. Certain elements correspond to higher Li diffusivity than others. For example, there are two regions of elements that contribute to high Li diffusivity: the alkali/alkaline metals group (IA and IIA) and the right-hand side of the periodic table, encompassing groups IB, IIB, and IIIA through VIIA. For compounds con- taining elements from these groups, a trend is observable: with an increasing row number (and hence, larger atomic radius), Li diffusivity also increases. The presence of cations 7", "page": 6, "position": 0}

SI Figure 7 further illustrates the standard deviation (STD) of Li diffusivity for compounds containing specific periodic elements. Notably, compounds that incorporate elements from groups IIB and IIIA to VIA demonstrate smaller STDs when compared to compounds containing alkali elements. SI Figures 8 and 9 present similar plots for the activation barrier (Ea) of Li+, de- rived from the more limited multi-temperature amorphous dataset. Owing to the smaller sample size of the data, the distribution of elements associated with lower Li Ea is not as pronounced as the Li diffusivity distribution from the 5000K database displayed in SI Figure 6. Nevertheless, compounds containing Cl, Br, I, S, Se, Pb, Sr, Sn, In, Ba, Na, K, and Rb demonstrate lower Ea than other compounds. This observation aligns with cases of high Li diffusivity in the 5000K database, as depicted in SI Figure 6. Our analysis encompasses compounds that range from binary to ternary, quaternary, and even quinary. Consequently, Li-ion diffusivity associated with one element often cross-correlates with other elements present in the same set of compounds. This neces- sarily results in some over-counting and cooperative effects on Li diffusivity or Ea. To deconvolute these relationships, we focus on available binary LiX compounds (where X represents any species within the composition). This approach allows us to clarify the correlations between Li diffusivity and other elements. Figure 3 illustrates the correlation between the activation barrier of Li (Ea) and the properties of the X species in LiX compounds. Panel a reveals a negative correlation between Ea and the Li fraction in the composition. This observation corresponds to a similar phenomenon found in crystalline solid-state electrolyte systems, denoted ’Li stuffing’, where increased Li content improves 8", "page": 7, "position": 0}

Panel b demonstrates a strong negative relationship between Li Ea and the atomic radius of X (RX), showing that larger X species facilitates Li diffusion by providing more spacious frameworks and - in the case of anions, lowers the electronega- tivity. In SI Figure 10, the color gradient further clarifies why some large-radius points do not exhibit correspondingly small Ea: a lower Li percentage. Thus, for compounds with similar Li percentages, a larger atomic radius of X implies lower Ea. Figure 3 panel c presents an approximately linear negative correlation between Li Ea and the product of Li fraction (Li%) and atomic radius of X RX. Panels d and e explore the influence of X species’ group and row numbers on Li Ea in LiX. As the group number of X and the corresponding electronegativity difference between Li and X increase, Li Ea tends to rise due to stronger Li-X bonds, thus inhibiting Li diffusion. Although an increase in X row number generally results in lower mean values of Li Ea, the impact is not pronounced due to the wide Ea distribution within species of the same row number. Panel f highlights the trend that larger X row numbers correlate with larger atomic radii, with the hue distinguishing X species from different groups. Feature design for machine learning As previously analyzed, both compositional and elemental properties of species correlate with Li diffusivity. However, other features also directly or indirectly impact Li diffusivity. Building on the work of Sendek et al. [26], who developed a feature set to differentiate high- and low-diffusivity materials, we have expanded the feature set to include more compositional features. This approach equips the machine learning models to learn the underlying correlations between the features and Li diffusivity more comprehensively. The expanded list of features, sorted by their Pearson correlation coefficient, is provided in Table 1. The compositional features added to the feature set here include Li percentage 9", "page": 8, "position": 0}

A similar trend has been observed in amorphous coating materials for Li-ion batteries as well as crystalline solid-state electrolyte materials[14, 15, 25]. The weighted average of cohesive energy Ecoh is calculated from the cohesive energy of the ground state of the constituent elemental systems. The cohesive energy provides a useful metric for describing the average bond strength of the local units in the amorphous material. Specifically, the stronger the bonds, the harder it is for the activated bond-breaking process to occur, which underpins the diffusion process. Hence, Ecoh negatively correlates with the Li diffusivity. In addition, a few other features show a negative correlation with Li diffusivity and can be explained in terms of the packing fraction of a set of non-lithium (non-Li) atoms that are in close proximity to a central lithium (Li) atom within a specified radius. We here denote these features as i) set-of-non-Li-atoms packing fraction (SPF), ii) set-of-non-Li-atoms neighbor count (SNC), iii) Li neighbor count (LNC), iv) Li bond ionicity (LBI), and v) density. These structural features also show a strong negative correlation with Li diffusivity, as when the non-Li atoms are parking closely and form a tight structural motif framework, it is harder for Li to diffuse.

Two ensemble learning models, Random Forest (RF)[27] and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XG- Boost) [28], were employed to learn the temperature-dependent diffusivity. The parity plots comparing the DFT calculated Li diffusivity and ML-predicted Li diffusivity for both training and test data are shown in Figure 4. We observe that both algorithms achieve coefficients of determination (R2) close to 1, very low mean absolute error (MAE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), as annotated on the plots. Five-fold cross-validations have been used to assess the performance and the generalization ability of these two models via Scikit-learn[29]. Both RF and XGBoost measure feature importance, which indicates the relative significance of a particular feature in diffusivity prediction. The top 10 most relevant features identified from RF and XGBoost models are shown in Figure 4 c and f, respectively. Somewhat trivially, both models rank temperature as the most important feature for predicting the diffusivity at different temperatures. Further, while the orders of the important features predicted from RF and XGBoost may differ, both models share similar highly ranked features: average atomic volume (AAV), Li percentage in the compositions (Li%), the ratio (RBI) of average Li bond ionicity (LBI) with average bond ionicity of set-of-non-Li-atoms (SBI), average Li neighbor count (LNC), etc. The definitions of features can be referenced to Table 1, SI, and Ref [26] for details. Finally, we developed a descriptor for Li+ diffusivity using the sure independence screening and sparsifying operator (SISSO) method [30]. The SISSO model training and prediction results are shown in 5.

However, for the test dataset, when the dimension increases from 1 to 4, the RMSE does not decrease monotonically; instead, it reaches the minimum when the dimension is 3, indicating overfitting beyond this point. As a result, we finalized our SISSO model at the 3-dimensional level. The analytical equation for the three-dimensional model is as follows: (1) d DLi = 4.4 × 10−4 · T · SPF + Li% PF −2.1 × R2· q B·R m −Li LLB LLB −LNC −0.28 × (Li% −SBI) × (SDLI −RLi R ) −0.67 The first term of this equation has demonstrated a satisfactory prediction for Li diffu- sivity (DLi), with positive correlations to temperature (T) and Li percentage (Li%) and a negative correlation to the structure’s packing fraction (PF). This aligns with the Pearson correlation coefficients sign, indicating that a higher Li percentage, elevated temperature, and looser packing fraction tend to augment Li diffusivity. The SPF and PF ratio also shows a positive correlation with DLi. The equation’s second term reveals a negative cor- relation between DLi and an artificially designed synthetic term ( ¯R2 · q ¯B· ¯R ¯m −Li) with the same unit as diffusivity. In this term, R, B, and m symbolize the weighted average of the atomic radius, bulk modulus, and atomic mass, respectively, for the non-Li-atoms compo- sition. As such, it logically follows that for the neighboring atoms of Li, a larger atomic radius and higher bulk modulus of their corresponding elements make the diffusion of Li more challenging. This negative correlation also depends on the difference between Li-Li bonds and Li-neighbor counts (LLB-LNC). While the second and third terms marginally improve the prediction for DLi, the first term primarily determines the overall trend. 16", "page": 15, "position": 0}

For 245 samples of amorphous compositions, the distribution of R2 of RDF comparison is plotted in Figure 6 c, where 91% of samples exhibit a R2 > 0.85, 85% of samples show R2 > 0.9, and 68% of samples manifest R2 > 0.95. The parity plot of structure feature comparison is shown in Figure 6 d with a decent R2 of 0.95. The scales of the structure features have a wide range; the parity plots with different scales can be found in SI Fig- ure 11. At all ranges, the M3GNet MD calculations can reproduce the AIMD-calculated structures. Therefore, we find that M3GNet is able to generate reasonable amorphous structures and calculate structure features as inputs for the SISSO model to predict Li diffusivity. However, while M3GNet is able to reproduce the Li diffusivity as shown in SI Figure 12a decently well for the temperature range from 1000K to 2500K, it fails to reproduce AIMD-calculated Li diffusivity at high temperatures (5000K). Therefore, it is suggested that M3GNet be used as a surrogate for AIMD calculations to generate amorphous structures and then used to calculate structure features for the SISSO model to predict Li diffusivity. By employing M3GNet-based molecular dynamics (MD), the calculations achieve a significant speedup of approximately 2000 times (in CPU hours) compared to traditional AIMD methods for diffusivity calculation. 17", "page": 16, "position": 0}

This database provides a robust platform for various streamlined machine-learning models, enabling rapid and accurate predictions of ionic diffusivity, here demonstrated for Li+ and rele- vant for applications such as protective coatings and solid-state electrolytes. Universal potentials such as M3GNet and CHGNet, which are predominantly trained on crystalline relaxation trajectories, significantly accelerate calculations compared to traditional AIMD methods and are found to perform well in structure generation but less so for providing ionic diffusivity data.

A tentative volume is then used to execute another 4 ps NVT AIMD run, ensuring the energy and density have converged. If convergence is achieved, a 20 ps AIMD “production” run is conducted using this volume. If not, the workflow iteratively rescales the volume until a value that ensures energy and density convergence is identified. This converged volume is then employed for the 20 ps production run. As shown in Figures 7a, the 5000 K NVT runs have so far generated amorphous structures for more than 5000 compositions.

Ten structures are sampled every 2 ps for DFT relaxation and static calculation, with their corresponding formation energy serving as the amor- phous limit to predict synthesizability, following the method proposed by Aykol et al. [33]. Machine learning potential workflow The M3GNet model developed by Chen et al. [31] offers an alternative surrogate model for AIMD computations, enabling the generation of amorphous structures and computation of Li diffusivities across various compositions. This surrogate model has been incorporated into the MPMorph workflow, serving as the calculator for energy and force. The imple- mented version can be accessed at https://github.com/Tinaatucsd/mpmorph/blob/ 20", "page": 19, "position": 0}

Random forest and XGBoost models For model development, we utilized random sampling to divide the multi-temperature dataset into training and test sets. The training data constitutes 85% of the total data, with the remaining 15% reserved for testing. The specific settings for XGBoost models are n estimators = 200, max depth = 4, n jobs = 6, and cross-validation score = negative root mean squared error. Default values are used for all other hyper-parameters of the XGBoost model and the Random Forest (RF) model implemented in the scikit-learn package. SISSO model A number of SISSO models[30] with increasing complexities were trained, and their pre- diction performances are shown in Figure 5. Some of the key input settings for SISSO training include the dimension of the descriptor desc dim=5; the Number of scalar features nsf=43; The parameters used to control the feature complexity rung=2 and maxcomplex- ity=5; The operator set considered include addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/), exponentiation such as (2), (3), (6),(−1),(exp),(exp-),(log).
