Here, to explore alloying properties, we constructed a neural network potential (NNP) of Au-Li binary systems based on density functional theory (DFT) calculations. To accelerate construction of NNPs, we proposed an eﬃcient and inexpensive method of structural dataset generation. The predictions by the constructed NNP on lattice parameters and phonon properties agree well with those obtained by DFT calculations. We also investigated the mixing energy of Au1−xLix with ﬁne composition grids, showing excellent agreement with DFT veriﬁcations. We found the existence of various compositions with structures on and slightly above the convex hull, which can explain the lack of consensus on the Au-Li stable phases in previous studies. Moreover, we newly found Au0.469Li0.531 as a stable phase, which has never been reported elsewhere. Finally, we examined the alloying process starting from the phase separated structure to the complete mixing phase. We found that when multiple adjacent Au atoms dissolved into Li, the alloying of the entire Au/Li interface started from the dissolved region. This paper demonstrates the applicability of NNPs toward miscible phases and provides the understanding of the alloying mechanism. DOI: I.

In Li-ion batteries (LIBs), Au is shown to form high-Li-concentration sta- ble alloy phases at low voltages in addition to the low alloying/dealloying potential. This implies that Au is a promising candidate for an anode electrode material in LIBs [5]. Moreover, thin-layer Au inserted at the inter- face of the Li-anode and a solid electrolyte can suppress void formations, resulting in enhanced cyclability and re- duction of interface resistance [6, 7]. In novel non-volatile memory devices, the amount of Li at the interface of the Au cathode and Li3PO4 solid electrolyte controls switch- ing behavior [8, 9]. These aspects highlight the signiﬁ- cance of atomic scale-based studies of Au-Li structural properties and to what extent the alloying proceeds in materials design and development of electrochemical de- vices. Experiments using thermal analysis and X-ray mea- surement report the observed Au-Li phases to be α (17 to 40 at.% Li), Au5Li4, β (47 to 56 at.% Li), δ (62.5 to 65.5 at.% Li), AuLi3, and Au4Li15 [1]. Electrochemical measurements and theoretical calculations identify the ∗shimizu@cello.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp † watanabe@cello.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp AuLi3 and Au2Li phases as the stable alloy phases, and Au3Li5, Au2Li3, and Au5Li3 as the metastable phases [2]. Another theoretical work based on density functional theory (DFT) calculations presents Au3Li, AuLi, AuLi2, and AuLi3 as stable phases at 0 GPa [4]. The available stable phases stored in the Materials Project (MP) [10] database are Au3Li, AuLi, AuLi3, and Au4Li15. Dis- crepancies among the previous studies seen above arise from the intrinsic complexity of miscible alloy materi- als.

Furthermore, high computational costs loaded in a theoretical investigation over a wide compositional space contribute to the lack of consensus on the stable Au-Li phases. Conventional theoretical studies on alloying properties of other materials also employ DFT calculations to obtain the mixing energies of various compositions and to draw phase diagrams [11–13]. However, in most cases, research studies focus on a few stable phases owing to the afore- mentioned formidable computational costs of a compre- hensive search over a wide range of compositions at the ab initio level. Alternatively, classical molecular dynam- ics (MD) simulations using empirical interatomic poten- tials are able to take into consideration various computa- tional conditions; however, the accuracy of this approach is limited by the quality of the empirical interatomic po- tentials, which is often insuﬃcient. In recent years, ma- chine learning (ML) interatomic potentials, e.g., neural network potential (NNP) [14], Gaussian approximation potential (GAP) [15], and spectral neighbor analysis po- tential (SNAP) [16], have been gaining much attention because of their lower computational costs by several or- der of magnitude while achieving comparable accuracy arXiv:2008.05094v1 [cond-mat.mtrl-sci] 12 Aug 2020", "page": 0, "position": 2}

Particularly, ML potentials have been successfully ap- plied to binary and ternary alloy systems [17–21]. The NNPs of the Cu-Pd, Cu-Ag, Pd-Ag, and Cu-Pd-Ag systems reproduce defect and formation energies and phonon properties well in comparison to DFT calcula- tions [17], wherein an eﬃcient way of constructing multi- element NNPs are proposed, so-called stratiﬁed NN. The NNPs also have been applied to Al-Mg-Si alloys [18], Li- Si alloys [19], and Pd-Si alloys [20], where all NNPs ac- curately predict physical properties comparable to DFT results. Moreover, the Ni-Mo interatomic potential con- structed using SNAP has demonstrated that the pre- dicted phase diagram agrees well with the experiment, as well as the DFT-level prediction of various physical prop- erties [21]. The ML potentials have also been applied to simulate Li-ion diﬀusion in amorphous-Li3PO4 [22] and in Li10GeP2S12 and Li7La3Zr2O12 [23], and to simulate the Li intercalations in carbon [24] anodes. These poten- tials were able to accurately reproduce their correspond- ing DFT quantities and exhibited better performance in comparison to empirical potentials. As far as our literature search is concerned, ML potential-based investigations on the Au-Li binary sys- tem have not yet been reported. Given their ability to reliably reproduce the diﬀerent ab initio quantities at lower computational cost, ML potentials may be able to oﬀer some resolutions on the above-mentioned discrep- ancies in this system. Despite its successes in predict- ing alloy properties, ML potentials are not without chal- lenges. One such challenge is the proper generation of structural datasets needed for training the NNP, which is often achieved through ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations. The reliability of NNP strongly depends on the randomness of structural features of the dataset, which in turn requires long simulation runs. To the best of our knowledge, a robust method of generat- ing and preparing datasets for NNP training has not yet been developed.

In the present study, we constructed an NNP for the Au-Li binary system in an eﬃcient and inexpensive way of structural dataset generation, which we used to inves- tigate its alloying properties. The accuracy of the NNP was corroborated by calculating the equation of state and phonon dispersions of some representative Au-Li alloy structures and comparing them with DFT results. From the mixing energies of Au1−xLix, we found that there were several structures at various alloy compositions that lay on or slightly above the convex hull, which could ex- plain the discrepancies among the previously reported alloy phases. We also found a new stable Au-Li alloy phase that has not yet been reported in the literature. In conjunction, we present a new and eﬃcient method of structural dataset generation for NNP training, which allows an inexpensive construction of accurate NNPs. This paper is organized as follows. Section II describes the computational conditions of DFT and NNP, and the procedure to construct the NNP. In Sec. III, we present the results of predicted physical properties using the con- structed NNP. The stable phase search and alloying pro- cess of the phase separated structure are also provided in Sec. III. Finally, conclusions are presented in Sec. IV. II. METHODOLOGY A. DFT calculations We ﬁrstly performed DFT-based AIMD calculations using the following structures to generate a temporal structural dataset for NNP construction: face centered cubic (FCC) Au, body centered cubic (BCC) Au, BCC Li, FCC Li, ordered FCC Au3Li (32 atoms/supercell), BCC AuLi (54 atoms/supercell), and rocksalt AuLi3 (128 atoms/supercell), as well as Au/Li superlattices of BCC Au0.5Li0.5 (96 atoms/supercell) and FCC Au0.5Li0.5 (160 atoms/supercell). The supercells of these structures are shown in Fig. 1 schematically. We carried out constant temperature (NV T-ensemble) AIMD simulations with 1 fs time step for 1 ps. The initial temperature was set to 300 K and linearly increased up to 2000 K", "page": 1, "position": 1}

The supercells of these structures are shown in Fig. 1 schematically. We carried out constant temperature (NV T-ensemble) AIMD simulations with 1 fs time step for 1 ps. The initial temperature was set to 300 K and linearly increased up to 2000 K (at 1.7 K/fs) to obtain largely random struc- tural features. Considering the high computational costs of AIMD calculations, further structural generations was conducted using NNP-based MD simulations and sub- sequent static DFT calculations were performed for the extracted structures. For DFT calculations, we used the generalized gra- dient approximation with the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof functional [26], the plane wave basis set (500 eV cutoﬀ energy), and the projector augmented wave method [27]. Brillouin zone integration was performed using the sam- pling technique of Monkhorst and Pack (5 × 5 × 5 and 5 × 5 × 1 sampling meshes for cubic cells and rectangular cells, respectively) [28]. We used Vienna Ab initio Simu- lation Package (VASP) software [29, 30] for all the DFT calculations. B. NNP construction We adopted high-dimensional NNP [14] to describe the interatomic potential of Au and Li atoms. In this scheme, the information of atomic structures is encoded as the values of symmetry functions (SFs) and is related to the energy contribution of each atom, Ei, via the neural net- work. The total energy of the system is then described by the sum over the energy contributions of the respec- tive atoms (E = P i Ei). Subsequently, the forces along the atomic coordinates α = x, y, z can be expressed as Fαi = −∂E/∂αi = −P ν ∂E/∂Gν × ∂Gν/∂αi, where ν labels the type of SFs. We used the radial (G2) and angular (G3) SFs in the following forms. Gi 2 = X j̸=i e−η(Rij−Rs)2fc(Rij), (1)", "page": 1, "position": 2}

The set of hyper-parameters used in the present study are shown in Section S1 and Table S1 in Supplemen- tary Materials. We used 6 and 18 kinds of radial and angular SFs, respectively, for each elemental combina- tion. The combinations for Au atoms include Au-{Au, Li} and Au-{Au-Au, Au-Li, Li-Li} for radial and angu- lar SFs, respectively. Similarly, the combinations of SFs for Li atoms include Li-{Au, Li} and Li-{Au-Au, Au-Li, Li-Li}. Thus, the total number of input nodes (i.e., val- ues of SFs) is 2 × 6 + 3 × 18 = 66 per atom. The SF values were normalized within the range of [−1:1] prior to passing through the NN. Based on the total energies and atomic forces ob- tained by the DFT calculations, we optimized the weight parameters using the limited-memory Broyden-Fletcher- Goldfarb-Shanno (l-BFGS) algorithm [31] with the fol- FIG. 2.

In the beginning of the NNP training, we evaluated 50 diﬀerent, randomly assigned weight parameter sets, in which each weight value was chosen within the range of [−1:1]. Afterward, we started l-BFGS training with the smallest error weight set using energy diﬀerences, i.e., α = 1.0 and β = 0. Subsequently, we continued the training using both energy and atomic force diﬀerences using the setting α = 0.5 and β = 0.5. C. Structural dataset generation In this section, we will explain the eﬃcient method of NNP construction and structural dataset generation that we developed for the present study. Figure 2 shows the workﬂow of our NNP construction. First, we constructed a tentative NNP using the structures obtained by the AIMD calculations (please refer to Section II A for the computational conditions). Although this tentative NNP is usually less accurate and insuﬃcient for practical use, it was enough to be used for generating additional struc- tures that were added to the training dataset. To obtain these additional structures, we coupled our NNP with Large-scale Atomic/Molecular Massively Parallel Simu- lator (LAMMPS) software [32, 33] using our homemade interface and carried out NV T- and NPT-ensembles MD calculations for the structures shown in Fig. 1. In the present study, we performed 10-100 ps NNP-MD with a 1 fs time step. The temperatures were set from 300-2100 K at 300 K intervals for the Au case, 300-600 K at 100", "page": 2, "position": 1}

The maximum tem- peratures were chosen based on being several hundreds of Kelvin higher than the materials’ melting temperatures. It is worth noting that rough NNP-MD simulations are often terminated by numerical errors due to structure col- lapses as mentioned in Ref. [34, 35], wherein the training technique that can construct accurate and numerically stable NNPs was developed. To select only those structures that have diﬀerent structural features from the ones already included in the collected dataset, we performed principal compo- nent analysis (PCA) based on the SFs of each struc- ture, where 66 × N-dimensional (where N = number of atoms/structure) local atomic/structural features were reduced to 2-dimensional values, i.e., ﬁrst and second principal components (PC1 and PC2). Having similar PC values means that those structures have similar struc- tural features. In fact, structures resembling each other can be found frequently in MD trajectories. We calcu- lated SFs for 1% of structures extracted from the NNP- MD trajectories. Then, we chose a speciﬁc number of structures by calculating the distances of neighboring FIG. 4.

As an example, Figure 4 shows the structures corresponding to the maximum and minimum PC values in rectangular FCC Au0.5Li0.5. The maximum PC1 corresponds to the phase separated structure. Conversely, at the minimum PC1 value, the Au and Li atoms were completely mixed. Both the maximum and minimum PC2 show the partial mixture of Au and Li atoms, which is reasonable because their PC1 values were located near the origin. The struc- tures wee more disordered as the PC2 value decreased, although the diﬀerence is rather ambiguous compared to PC1 cases. After PCA, we subsequently performed static DFT calculations for the new structures to obtain the to- tal energies and atomic forces. These were then used to update our dataset and retrain our NNP. We performed this cycle iteratively until we could achieve an accurate NNP. We generated 8696 structures in total, including 1973 Au, 1900 Li, 949 Au3Li, 992 AuLi, 929 AuLi3, 971 rectangular BCC Au0.5Li0.5, and 982 rectangular FCC Au0.5Li0.5 structures. However, we found that at low-Au- concentration alloys, the calculated mixing energies using the NNP seriously deviated from the DFT veriﬁcations. Therefore, we further added 589 Au dilute alloy struc- tures, i.e., Au1Li31, Au1Li53, and Au1Li127, obtained by the procedure explained above.

In their method, NNPs with diﬀerent network architectures con- structed by the same dataset are used to predict energies for a large number of structures (generated for instance by NNP-MD). A large diﬀerence in predicted energies of a same structure among NNPs indicates that its atomic features are missing in that dataset. In addition, Li and Ando applied this scheme to the on-the-fly sampling technique [37]. Compared with these previous methods, the present approach needed to construct only a single NNP. The lower computational costs for the training pro- cess would be the advantage against the above methods. III. RESULTS & DISCUSSION A. Au-Li binary system NNP Using the 9285 structures mentioned in the previous section, we constructed NNPs for the Au-Li binary sys- tem. We examined cutoﬀdistances of 5, 7, and 9 ˚A with the NNs consisting of 2 hidden layers and 10 or 20 nodes per hidden layer. The obtained root-mean-square-error (RMSE) values are summarized in Section S1 and Ta- ble S2 in Supplementary Materials. We used a ran- domly chosen 10% of the structures in the dataset as the test/validation data. We found that all the con- structed NNPs predicted nicely both the DFT total en- ergies and atomic forces. The RMSE values are com- parable to or even better than the previous studies [14, 19, 22, 34, 38, 39]. Note that the good prediction performance of the NNP with a cutoﬀdistance of 5 ˚A sug- gests the insigniﬁcance of long-range interaction in Au- Li systems. Considering the tradeoﬀbetween reliability of longer cutoﬀdistances and computational costs, we used the 7 ˚A cutoﬀdistance and [66-10-10-1] network structure hereafter. The RMSE of total energies and atomic forces in this setting were 1.53 meV/atom and 23.1 meV/˚A for the training dataset and 1.46 meV/atom and 22.9 meV/˚A for the test dataset, respectively.

Figure 5 shows the comparison between DFT and NNP on the total energies and atomic forces.

In addition, the learning curves of the total energies and atomic forces are shown in Fig. S1. The mean-square-error (MSE) values monotonically decreased for both total energies and atomic forces, which indicates that no overﬁtting oc- cured. Note that the preceding 968 (α = 1.0, β = 0.0) and 7933 (α = 0.5, β = 0.5) iterations were performed ahead of the last training curves shown in Fig. S1. FIG. 5.

The DFT and NNP results agreed well on the minimum vol- ume and energy: the maximum diﬀerences were smaller than 0.1 ˚A3/atom and 3.78 meV/atom. The bulk mod- uli were also accurately predicted within a 10% diﬀer- ence, wherein the deviations mainly originated at the compressed structures. Detailed results on ﬁtting to the Birch-Murnaghan equation are given in Section S3 and Table S3 in Supplementary Materials. FIG. 7. Comparison of phonon bands and densities of states obtained by DFT and NNP for (left) FCC Au and (right) BCC Li. Next, we performed phonon calculations for FCC Au, BCC Li, FCC Au3Li, BCC AuLi, and rocksalt AuLi3 structures based on DFT and NNP using phonopy soft- ware [40]. We used the same supercell size as shown in Fig. 1 and 0.05 ˚A displacements to calculate the force constants. Note that we used 0.02 ˚A displacements for the AuLi3 case to circumvent the appearance of imagi- nary frequencies around the X-point. Figure 7 shows the phonon band structures and the corresponding phonon densities of states (DOS) of FCC Au and BCC Li calculated by DFT and NNP. We found excellent agreement between the DFT- and NNP- obtained phonon modes and the peak structures of phonon DOS. These phonon features could also be found in other studies [41–43]. Similarly, Figure 8 shows the phonon bands and the corresponding phonon DOS of FCC Au3Li, BCC AuLi, and rocksalt AuLi3. The acous- tic modes have been well predicted by NNP while the optical modes of Au3Li show a slight discrepancy around the Γ-point. However, all the phonon modes match in the AuLi case. This may be attributed to the large number of Au:Li = 1:1 structures included in the training dataset. The phonon bands of AuLi3 show rather large discrepan- cies, which is probably due to the relatively sparse sam- pling of this composition (cf., Fig. S2 especially around the origin).

Note that we obtained imaginary frequencies for BCC Au and FCC Li phonon bands, which would be reasonable consid- ering the instability of these structures (not shown). This veriﬁes the accuracy of our NNP as well as its capability to reproduce lattice parameters and phonon properties. C. Phase stability of Au-Li compounds As mentioned in the Introduction, the stable Au-Li al- loy phases diﬀer among the previous research [1–4], which arises from the intrinsic complexity of miscible alloy ma- terials and the expensive computational costs. Here, uti- lizing the constructed NNP, we examined the mixing en- ergies of Au-Li with ﬁne composition grids. We used the ordered structures of Au3Li, AuLi, AuLi3, and Au4Li15 as the base structures (cf., Fig. 1 and Fig. S4 in Supple- mentary Materials), and Au and Li atoms were randomly replaced for the sake of compositional variations. Note that we replaced Au and Li at intervals of 1 and 4 atoms, respectively, for Au3Li, AuLi, Au4Li15, and AuLi3 base structures. Each structure was ﬁrst equilibrated by an NPT ensemble MD simulation for 200 ps at T = 500 K. Our choice of T = 500 K is justiﬁed by the ﬁnding that this value seemed high enough to facilitate the mi- gration of atoms to reach stable conﬁgurations. This was then followed by an NV T and subsequently NV E en- sembles MD simulations for 200 ps each with the same temperature. Lastly, we fully optimized the structures (including lattice vectors and volume optimization) us- ing the conjugate gradient method with 10−3 meV and 1 meV/˚A of the total energy and atomic forces", "page": 5, "position": 1}

As veriﬁcation, we checked the total energies of resulting structures using static DFT calculations. The mixing energies were calculated by Emix = E(Au1−xLix) −{(1 −x)E(Au) + xE(Li)}, where E is the energy per atom of the composition designated in the parentheses. Figure 9 shows the calculated mixing energies using the NNP and static DFT calculations. The squares, circles, triangles, and inverse triangles correspond to Au3Li, AuLi, AuLi3, and Au4Li15 base structures, re- spectively. The ﬁlled symbols indicate the so-called con- vex hull points, which are connected by the solid lines. The resulting mixing energies show good agreement be- tween NNP and DFT over the whole compositional space. While one exception exists at the convex hull point with x = 0.531, the extremely small energy diﬀerence of the order of 5.80 meV/atom at this point is indistinguish- able. From the mixing energy proﬁles, we found that Au3Li, AuLi, AuLi3, and Au4Li15 consisted of the con- vex hull, as is the case in the MP. In addition, we found Au0.469Li0.531, Au0.406Li0.594, and Au0.344Li0.656 as the hull points. The structures of these three phases are shown in Fig. 10. The common neighbor analysis method [44] identiﬁed that Au0.469Li0.531 and Au0.406Li0.594 have BCC and FCC crystal structures, respectively. Con- versely, Au0.344Li0.656 had the laminated structure of two layers of FCC and HCP along the a-axis. The radial distribution functions (RDFs) clearly show that Au0.469Li0.531 simply replaced a few Au and Li atoms, keeping the AuLi crystal structure. Although the ﬁrst peaks of Au0.406Li0.594 and Au0.344Li0.656 were located close to that of Au3Li, the attenuations of subsequent peaks are indicative of their rather amorphous-like struc-", "page": 5, "position": 2}

In addition to the 7 convex hull points, we also found several points located slightly above the hull over the entire compositional space. These com- positions may appear in a speciﬁc experimental condition as meta-stable phases. We also performed the mixing energy calculations for the previously reported stable phases, i.e., Au2Li, Au5Li3, Au2Li3, Au3Li5, and AuLi2, starting from the provided space group information [2, 4]. The resulting mixing energies of Au5Li3, Au2Li3, and AuLi2 were lo- cated at 3.38, 6.04, and 4.97 meV/atom below the con- vex hull of Fig. 9, respectively, while Au2Li and Au3Li5 were 15.1 and 3.28 meV/atom higher than the convex hull, respectively, for the NNP case. Contrastingly, for all ﬁve compositions, the mixing energies obtained by DFT were located below the convex hull (please refer to Section S4 and Fig. S6 in Supplementary Materi- als for details). The mixing energies of Au2Li, Au5Li3, Au2Li3, Au3Li5, and AuLi2 were 1.58, 5.88, 4.16, 5.41, and 3.91 meV/atom lower than the convex hull lines at the corresponding composition ratio, respectively. How- ever, the subtle diﬀerences in mixing energies in the order of a few meV/atom could be easily buried by circum- stances and/or numerical accuracy. Thus, observing a part of the original phase is unavoidable. The discrep- ancy among previous studies mentioned earlier can be understood from the above reasoning.

As demonstrated above, our constructed NNP can be used over the entire range of binary alloy compositions, despite our training dataset including only a limited num- ber of Au-Li ratios, x. The precise investigation of mixing energy reveals the compositions that were not present in the previous studies. However, despite the ﬁne intervals of x, some crystal structures, inaccessible by the systems used in this work, exist. In fact, the ﬁve previously re- ported crystal structures were not covered in the search of Fig. 9. Further consideration, such as a diﬀerent num- ber of atoms per supercell, may enable us to draw a more accurate phase diagram. We shall leave this to our future studies. Next, to clarify the atomic-scale picture of the alloying process, we carried out NNP-MD (NPT at T = 500 K) simulations starting from the phase-separated structure, consisting of 10 atomic layers (32 atoms/layer) of FCC Au and Li using the Au lattice constant (Fig. 11(b)). Figure 11(a) shows the total energy proﬁle along the simulation time, and (b)-(e) show the MD snapshots to- gether with the atomic energy proﬁles. The colors in- dicate the magnitude of atomic energies along with the relative atomic positions. We found that at 4 ps, a single Au atom dissolved into the bulk Li (Fig. 11(c)). This occured due to the slightly larger energy gain of Au dissolving into Li than the Li", "page": 6, "position": 1}

The atomic energies of Au and Li are separately shown in the right-hand-side of each snapshot using relative atomic positions. The colors correspond to the magnitude of the atomic energies. dissolving into Au, which is corroborated by the mixing energies (cf., Fig. 9). This was followed by continued Au alloying into the Li until around 80 ps, where the total energy reached a plateau (Fig. 11(a)). At this plateau, Li mixed with Au over the entire Li bulk region while 6 layers of Au remained intact (Fig. 11(d)). The cell volume gradually decreased by reducing the length of the c-axis, which is attributed to the smaller optimal volume of alloys (cf., Figs. 6 and S3). The alloying was reinitiated at ca. 100 ps with the emergence of a second plateau in the total energy proﬁle. At 200 ps, complete alloying and equilibration (cf., Fig. 11(e)) was reached. The solution of Au atoms into Li at the initial stage of allying is a probabilistic process, and it proceeds inde- pendently at the both Au-Li interfaces. When multiple adjacent Au atoms dissolved into Li, the alloying of the entire interface started from the dissolved region. This corresponds to the steep energy decrease from ca. 4 to 30 ps as shown in Fig. 11(a). In the present case, the dissolu- tion of the lower interface initially took place. The upper interface follows from the inﬂection point of the energy proﬁle at ca. 12 ps. Note that the initial alloying process using 128 atoms/layer with 10 atomic layers of FCC Au and Li model is shown in Section S5 in Supplementary Materials. In terms of atomic energies, atoms located at the in- terface had lower values (Au: −3.71 eV, Li: −2.02 eV) compared to those of bulk region (Au: −3.28 eV, Li: −1.89 eV) at the initial structure. Atoms at the second layer from the interface, conversely, had higher values (Au: −3.23 eV, Li: −1.84 eV). This", "page": 7, "position": 0}

Atoms at the second layer from the interface, conversely, had higher values (Au: −3.23 eV, Li: −1.84 eV). This shows that the Au-Li sharp interface will spontaneously form an alloy. While thermal oscillation caused the atomic energy ﬂuctuation at the bulk region, e.g., 41.0 meV at 4 ps and 51.3 meV at 80 ps, the interface atoms had much lower energies. Once Au atoms mixed with Li atoms, the atomic energies de- creased further. A major part of atomic energy change by alloying was absorbed into the Au section. We shall also leave this point for future work. As demonstrated above, due to the high stability of Au-Li system, Au and Li atoms spontaneously mixed in the simulations within a few hundred picoseconds, which is a noticeably short period compared to the operating time of ionic devices. This alloying property, in other as- pects, leads to the stabilization of interfaces of secondary batteries using a Li anode (cf., e.g., Refs. [6, 7]). On the other hand, controlling the amount of Li introduced into Au must be a signiﬁcant factor for developing devices using ion conduction, such as VolRAM [8]. IV. CONCLUSIONS We constructed a neural network potential (NNP) for Au-Li binary systems based on density functional the- ory (DFT) calculations. We used a total of 9285 struc- tures, including pure Au and Li, ordered Au3Li, AuLi, and AuLi3, dilute Au alloys, and Au/Li superlattices as our dataset. We eﬃciently generated these structures us- ing NNP-based MD simulations, where unique structures were identiﬁed by principal component analysis based on symmetry functions. The predicted lattice parame- ters and phonon properties obtained by the NNP agree well with those from DFT calculations. We also inves- tigated the mixing energy of Au1−xLix, showing consis- tency with the DFT results over a wide range", "page": 7, "position": 1}

We successfully reproduced the convex hull points of Au3Li, AuLi, AuLi3 and Au4Li15, which are reposited in the Materials Project database as the stable phases. Additionally, we found three new alloy composi- tions of Au0.469Li0.531, Au0.406Li0.594, and Au0.344Li0.656, consisting of the convex hull. We further veriﬁed the previously reported phases of Au2Li, Au5Li3, Au2Li3, Au3Li5, and AuLi2 as stable phases. For compositions where there are discrepancies in stability among previous studies, we found that a small energy change of several meV/atom can alter whether or not they become stable phases. This is considered to be the origin of the discrep- ancies. Considering a vast search space and marginal en- ergy diﬀerences among alloy compositions, inexpensive", "page": 7, "position": 2}

Finally, we examined the alloying process starting from the phase separated structure to the complete mixing phase using our relatively large system. We found that at the initial stage of alloying, a single Au atom tends to dissolve into the Li region. Furthermore, we determined that when multiple adjacent Au atoms dissolve into Li, the alloying of the entire Au/Li interface starts from the dissolved region. In this study, we successfully constructed an accurate NNP via the proposed workﬂow. This would help to ac- celerate applications of ML interatomic potentials toward more complicated systems.
