Recently, the electrochemical nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR) using electricity generated from renewable sources has attracted widespread attention. However, the complex reaction pathway of NO3RR leads to the formation of many undesirable by-products. Herein we successfully prepared a mixed (FeMo)2C catalyst with good electrocatalytic NO3RR, having a NH3 yield of 14.66 mg h-1 cm-2 and an FE of 94.35 % at low potential -0.3 V vs RHE. DFT calculations show that the presence of Fe in Mo2C lattice changes the reaction mechanism, decreasing the potential barrier to be overcome from 1.36 to 0.89 eV. In addition, mixed Fe-Mo carbide facilitates the adsorption of intermediates and promotes NH3 desorption, facilitating NO3− reduction to NH3. In addition, (FeMo)2C was used as cathode for Zn-NO3 battery to generate electricity, producing ammonia at the same time, with a power density of 3.8 mWcm-2 and an NH3 FE of 88 %. This work describes a new synthesis method for mixed metal carbides and provides a promising strategy for NH3 production. 1. Introduction Ammonia (NH3) is among the chemicals produced in the largest quantities. In addition to its established use as fertilizer and in the chemical industry, novel potential large scale application related to its role as carbon-free transportation fuel or liquefiable hydrogen storage chemical are being seriously considered. The energy density (4.32 kWh L-1) comparable to that of hydrocarbons and its high hydrogen content (17.65 %), together with its boiling point, makes NH3 among the best chemicals for its use as fuel or hydrogen carrier. This perspective makes of interest to develop novel efficient NH3 preparation procedures to complement Haber-Bosch synthesis and that could be implemented on site without the need of a very large infrastructure. This scenario has motivated a current interest in the electrochemical nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR), since this process could use renewable electricity and will be aligned with the current electrification of the chemical processes. Compared to N2 reduction reaction, NO3RR presents several advantages including higher", "page": 1, "position": 0}

Selective NO3RR to NH3 is a complex process that requires the transfer of eight electrons and the corresponding number of H+ through a multistep reaction mechanism that can result in the formation of several undesirable by-products. [3, 4] In addition, the efficiency of NO3RR can be considerably decreased by the occurrence of concurrent hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). [5-7] Therefore, although there are several recent reports in the literature describing efficient NO3RR, [8-12] there is still room for improvement regarding Faradic efficiency, easy to prepare electrocatalysts based on abundant elements that can operate at high current densities forming selectively NH3 at high rates. It is known that transition metal carbides may have d orbital center energy similar to those of noble metals, and that their unoccupied d orbitals can overlap with those of adsorbates promoting catalytic reactions on their surfaces. In this regard, it has been shown that Mo2C is an efficient electrocatalyst for the N2 reduction reaction to NH3, due to the high N2 adsorption capacity on this material combined with a catalytic hydrogenation activity. [13-15] In this regard, a common strategy to further increase the activity of electrocatalysts is doping with appropriate heteroatoms. [16, 17] Adequate doping can tune the electronic states on the catalyst surface, therefore, adjusting the adsorption strength of the catalyst to reactants and intermediates to the optimal values. As an example of doping in NO3RR, it has been reported that Fe doping of Co3O4 increases the efficiency of NH3 by enhancing NO3-adsorption and inhibiting HER. [18] On the other hand, anchoring Fe atoms on Co3O4 avoids corrosion and surface oxidation of iron-based catalysts that are typically responsible for the poor stability of these electrocatalysts. [19, 20] Inspired by this precedent, herein we report the electrocatalytic activity for NO3RR of a Fe- doped Mo2C catalyst. X-ray absorption measurements and spherical aberration-corrected transmission electron microscopy (AC-HAADF-STEM) with single atom resolution show that this Fe-doped Mo2C material (FMC) contains single-atom Fe embedded into the Mo2C lattice.

Experimental Section 2.1 Chemicals and reagents All chemical reagents were purchased commercially and employed without any further purification. Deionized water (MilliQ) was obtained via IQ 7000 purification system from Merck.

Ultrapure MilliQ water was used in all experiments. Aqueous chitosan solutions were prepared by magnetic stirring for 30 min 0.3 g of this polymer in 50 mL ultrapure water adding 300 uL of CH3COOH to assist dissolution. This solution was impregnated with (NH4)6Mo7O24*4H2O (309 mg, 0.2 mmol) and FeCl2 (177.5 mg, 1.4 mmol) by previously dissolving separately these two salts in 15 ml MilliQ water each with the assistance of ultrasounds until complete dissolution. Then the two metal salt solutions were dropped consecutively into the chitosan hydrogel solution. After 60 min stirring, the Mo-Fe impregnated chitosan hydrogel was place in an autoclave and submitted to hydrothermal reaction at 175°C for 20 h. The resulting suspension was filtered and the brown solid was thoroughly washed with MilliQ water and dried at 50 oC overnight. The resulting dry powder was put in a ceramic crucible in an electric tubular furnace under 100 mL/min Ar flow and pyrolyzed at 800 °C for 2 h, heating from the ambient temperature at a rate of 3 °C/min. The sample resulting from the pyrolysis was named as FMC.", "page": 3, "position": 0}

The electron microscope is equipped with the STEM unit and high-angle annular dark field (HAADF) image detectors. Ni and Mo analyses were measured by inductively coupled plasma- optical emission spectrophotometry (ICP-OES, Varian 715-ES, CA, USA). Specimens were prepared by depositing onto a carbon-coated copper TEM grid one micreodrop of the material previously dispersed in ethanol by sonication and allowing ethanol to evaporate at room temperature. 1H NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker AV400 (400 MHz) spectrometer using known concentration DMSO as the internal standard.

All electrochemical measurements were performed under the Ar atmosphere. The electrocatalyst was previously deposited on a freshly polished glassy carbon by dispersing the solid material in ethanol containing 1 wt.% Paraloid as binder. The catalysts loading on the electrodes was adjusted to 1 mg/cm2, approximately. The supported catalysts, Hg/HgO (1 M NaOH), Pt wire and 0.1 M KOH + KNO3 were used as work electrode, reference electrode, counter electrode and electrolyte, respectively. LSV tests were conducted at a scan rate of 5 mV s-1 in the three-electrode system. The chronoamperometry tests were conducted at various applied potentials in a H-type cell of 28 mL capacity with electrolyte separated by a Nafion 117 membrane. The voltage and current was set with a Gamry potentiostat (Interface 5000E). All potentials in this work refer to RHE, E(RHE) = E(Hg/HgO) + 0.14 + 0.059pH, where pH of the measurements was 13.

The specific detection methods were presented in Supporting information. 2.5 Computational method All calculations were performed using spin-polarized density functional theory (DFT) as implemented in the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP). [23-25] The Perdew-Burke- Emzerhof (PBE) functional with a plane-wave cutoff energy of 500 eV was used. For structural optimizations, the Brillouin zone was sampled using a 5 × 5 × 1 k-point grid based on the Monkhorst-Pack scheme, centered at Gamma. A vacuum space of 1.5 nm in the z direction (perpendicular to the basal plane) was used to avoid interactions between periodic images. The convergence criteria for the force on each atom was set to 0.02 eV/Å, while the electronic structure energy convergence criteria was 10-5 eV. The Grimme D3 method with Becke- Johnson parameters [26] were employed to account for Van der Waals interactions.

First, an aqueous solution of equimolar amounts of (NH4)6Mo7O24 and FeCl2 metal salts n 15 ml of MilliQ water was prepared and added into another aqueous solution of chitosan dissolved with the aid of some acetic acid. The mixture was heated in an autoclave at 175 oC for 20 h to obtain a hydrogel. Subsequently, the resulting hydrogel containing well-dispersed metal ions into the chitosan fibrils were submitted to pyrolysis at 900 oC, for 2 h. Finally, FMC/CB were obtained by ultrasonicating the mixed solution of FMC and carbon black (CB) for 4 h. The role of CB is to increase the electrical conductivity of the electrocatalyst layer and to act as binder. Inconsistent electrochemical measurements were observed in the absence of CB additive due to electrocatalyst detachment. Figure 1a illustrates the preparation procedure. The XRD of the relevant sample is shown in Figure 1b. FMC is composed of a mixture of three separate phases corresponding to Fe3Mo3C, Mo2C as major components and Fe metal as very minor component. Unexpectedly, the sonication process to introduce carbon black (CB) allows a spontaneous crystal phase separation, the resulting FMC/CB containing only Mo2C according to PXRD. No Fe-containing species could be detected in the PXRD of the resulting FMC/CB. Furthermore, careful inspection of the XRD (Fig. 1c) shows that the main peaks of Mo2C in the 34-41° undergo a shift to higher angles of +0.05° in FMC and this shift further increases to +0.1° in the resulting FMC/CB. These shifts in PXRD are indicating the occurrence of a gradual doping that incorporates an heteroatom in the structure of Mo2C. [28] Therefore, a reasonable hypothesis to explain these PXRD data is that Fe atoms from the disappearing Fe3Mo3C phase are partially incorporated into the Mo2C lattice due to the action of the extended periods of high- power ultrasounds (700 W, 4 h) that will cause also the dissolution of Fe3Mo3C in the deionized water even at low temperature (0 oC).

Chemical analysis by ICP-OES of the aqueous phase after the sonication and the resulting FMC/CB powder is consistent with this proposal with most of the Fe being present in solution, but also in FMC/CB (Table S1). The PXRD patterns of FC/CB, FC, MC/CB and MC have been also measured, and they are presented as Fig. S1. The morphology of the samples was analyzed by TEM and SEM. TEM image of FMC show that the solid is composed of agglomeration of particles (Fig. S2). Note that N doping derives from chitosan precursor composition and should not play any major role in the process compared to the electrocatalyst.

Its corresponding line profiles for HAADF intensity analysis (Fig. 1g) present that the Fe atoms are dispersed by replacing the Mo atomic positions or being located between the Mo2C (101) planes. Notably, the images show the absence of Fe nanoparticles or clusters in the FMC/CB sample and the atomic dispersion of Fe element can be observed in the scanning transmission electron microscopy energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (STEM-EDS) (Fig. 1f and Fig. S6). The valence state of Mo and Fe can be determined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis. Mo3d of MC/CB can be deconvoluted in two sets of peaks with binding energies of 228.7 and 232.7 eV (Fig. 2a), which are attributed to Mo carbide and oxidized Mo species, respectively. It is worth noting that the binding energy of the Mo carbide peak of FMC/CB is shifted towards lower values from 228.7 to 228.25 eV, indicating that Fe atoms are giving electron density to the Mo atoms. Accordingly, the Fe2p peak of FMC/CB exhibits a slight shift towards higher binding energy values compared to FC/CB, due to the electron density donation of Fe atoms to Mo (Fig. S7). This effect of Fe on Mo in XPS has been previously reported. [29, 30] The Fe K-edge X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) measurements of FMC and FMC/CB were further performed to investigate the oxidation number and coordination states. FMC features a series of characteristic absorption peaks similar to those of Fe7C3 [31] at 7112 and 7130-7150 eV (Fig. 2b), indicating that the Fe local structure in FMC closely resembles that of Fe carbides. Furthermore, the Fourier-transformed (FT) spectrum of FMC (Fig. S8-9) reveals prominent coordination peak at 1.44 Å associated with the first-shell Fe-C scattering, which is consistent with the XANES results.

This suggests that most of the iron is present in islands of Fe carbides, whereas truly mixed FeMo carbides are less populated. In comparison with FMC, the k2χ(k) oscillation curve of FMC/CB attenuates noticeably slower as it approaches higher k value in the k-space (Fig. 2c-d). Rigorous fitting analysis determines a well-defined Fe-Mo contribution in the nearest neighbor of the Fe center. Furthermore, the indicated Fe-Mo bond length of 2.96 Å is equivalent to the Mo-Mo bond length (2.95-3.01 Å) of Mo2C (PDF#35-0787).

Electrocatalytic NO3RR performance In light of these evidences, we carried out a series of electrochemical measurements to determine the electrocatalytic NO3RR performance of the samples in a nitrate-containing electrolyte. The electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) was initially estimated based on measurements of the double-layer capacitance. As shown in Fig. S10, FMC/CB exhibits a larger ECSA Cdl of 28.4 mF/cm2 than the other samples. Furthermore, linear sweep voltammogram (LSV) plots shown in Fig. 3a indicate that all samples show a significant current density increase when the electrolyte contains NO3- in comparison with inert electrolyte. Especially, FMC/CB incorporating Fe atoms into the Mo2C lattice displayed the highest current density at low potential (more than 50 mA/cm2 at -0.3 V vs RHE).", "page": 10, "position": 0}

Based on the previous LSV data, chronoamperometry (CA) measurements were carried out at various applied potentials to quantitatively assess the NO3RR performance of the samples determining NH3 yields and FEs. The results are presented in Figure 3b that compares the performance of FMC/CB, FC/CB and MC/CB for the NO3RR in the potential range from −0.1 to −0.5 V. Obviously, FC/CB exhibits a relatively high FE of by-product NO2- at low potential, while the occurrence of HER can be effectively avoided at high potential. In contrast, although MC/CB exhibits lower FE of NO2- at low potential, a large proportion of by-product H2 is produced. Interestingly, FMC/CB just combines the advantages of FC/CB and MC/CB without their disadvantages, exhibiting the highest NH3 FE over a wide potential range. In addition, the onset potential of FMC/CB was as low as -0.1 V vs RHE, and showed the highest FE of 94.35% at -0.3 V, with the corresponding NH3 yield reaching 14.66 mg h cm -2 (Fig. 3c). It is worth mentioning that the FE of NH3 formation was always higher than 85% in the potential window of the measurement. In addition to using colorimetric methods for quantitative analysis of NH3 (Fig. S11 and S12), 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy was also used to quantify NH3 (Fig. S13). The coincidence between the two quantification methods was remarkable, thus re-confirming the validity of the experimental data. The comparison of the electrocatalytic NO3RR performance here measured for FMC/CB with those of reported electrocatalysts is summarized in Table S3. This literature survey clearly reveals that FMC/CB exhibits superior NH3 yield and FE than those electrocatalysts previously reported in the literature. Considering that industrial wastewaters may differ in a wide range of NO3- concentrations, FMC/CB was also screened as electrocatalyst using electrolytes containing different NO3- concentrations (Fig. S14).

For that reason, we have performed a stability test to FMC/CB, monitoring the current density and NH3 FE upon continuous -0.3 V vs. RHE applied bias for 24 h. As can be seen in Fig. 15 in SI, nearly constant current density and NH3 FE were observed. Moreover, the LSV of the FMC/CB electrode prior and after the stability test is also presented as Fig. S15 b, demonstrating a notable stability during this operation for this time period. In order to further highlight the stability of FMC/CB, the XRD patterns of FMC/CB after the stability test has been also recorded and compared with that of the fresh sample (Fig. S16 in SI).

DFT calculations DFT simulations were performed to elucidate the NO3RR mechanism, and to investigate the origin of the difference in the activities of MC, FC and FMC. On pure MC, the reaction starts with the adsorption of *NO3-, which is favorable, the anion resulting strongly bound, with a calculated adsorption energy of -1.14 eV (Fig. 5a). Then, a first protonation occurs forming *NO3H which is more stable than the precursors by 0.16 eV. Water elimination leads to the formation of *NO2, which is strongly stabilized, lying at -2.89 eV. Protonation of this intermediate leads to *NO2H formation, which is the potential-dependent step (PDS) of the whole reaction, of which the maximum reaction free energy is 1.36 eV at -0.33 V vs standard hydrogen electrode (SHE), followed by the subsequent exergonic water elimination to obtain *NO, which is strongly stabilized, with an energy of -3.48 eV. From the *NO intermediate, two pathways can be followed, namely either the protonation of the nitrogen atom leading to *NHO or the protonation of the oxygen atom leading to *NOH. Both pathways are thermodynamically uphill, requiring an energy of 1.15 and 1.25 eV to be formed, respectively. From *NOH, the subsequent water elimination to obtain *N is strongly exergonic, at -3.74 eV. The subsequent protonation to *NH and *NH2 are isoenergetic, and the final protonation to *NH3 is exergonic. On the other hand, the formation of *NHO leads to the protonation of the oxygen atom to obtain *NHOH, from which water elimination can occur to obtain *NH and eventually *NH3, which is strongly adsorbed to the surface with an energy of -1.23 eV. Introducing Fe in the MC structure (FMC) results to three major changes in the pathway for ammonia reduction (Fig 5a). First, the *NO2H intermediate (which was the PDS for the undoped surface) has not been found to be stable on this interface.

Secondly, the presence of Fe in the structure moves the PDS from the previous *NO2H formation to the generation of the *NHO intermediate from *NO, the last species having an energy value of 0.89 eV. Finally, while on the pristine surface both pathways from either *NOH or *NHO could be followed due to their close energies, now the *NHO pathway is the most probable, since this intermediate has been found to have a lower energy compared to the alternative *NOH possibility with an energy difference of 0.5 eV, making the *NOH pathway no longer available. Thus, from *NHO a second protonation and subsequent water elimination affords *NH, from which strongly exergonic steps lead to the formation of *NH3. The presence of Fe as dopant has also a strong effect on the adsorption energy of NO3- and NH3, with values that are almost halved compared to the pristine surface, namely -0.72 eV for *NO3", "page": 14, "position": 1}

The much lower adsorption energy obtained for NH3 might hint to its ease of desorption on this surface compared to the pristine case. On the other hand, when we consider the FC surface we observe an intermediate situation compared to MC and FMC, in agreement with the experiments. Three major differences can be seen for this surface. Specifically, the *NO3H energy is now the less favorable among the three surfaces, with value of 0.12 eV (compared to 0.05 eV and -0.16 eV for FMC and MC, respectively), suggesting a more sluggish reaction. This can be rationalized considering the high NO3- adsorption energy, of -2.35 eV. Secondly, the *NO2H intermediate is once more observed, as for the MC surface, but with an energy value difference from *NO of 0.73 eV which, albeit lower than for MC, still requires a high energy input to be overcome. Finally, the formation of the *NHO intermediate from *NO is now the PDS of the whole pathway, with an energy difference value of 0.95 eV, higher than for FMC by 0.06 eV. As for FMC, the *NOH pathway from *NO oxygen protonation is not accessible, due to the high energy required to obtain the *NOH intermediate. Interestingly, the protonation of *NHO to *NHOH leads to the isoenergetic dissociation of the species into *NH and *OH on the surface, making this step less favorable than on both FMC and MC surfaces. The comparison of reaction pathways, for MC (a) FMC (b) and FC (c) interfaces at different applied potentials of 0 and -0.33 V, were shown in Fig. S17.", "page": 15, "position": 0}

(a) Gibbs free energy reaction pathway for the NH3 formation on MC, FMC and FC interfaces, at an applied potential of -0.33 V; Density of states (DOS) on the 3d orbitals for Mo (in MC) (b) and Fe (in FMC) (c) metal centres and on the 2p orbitals of NHO. The experimental enhancement in electrocatalytic activity observed for the FMC surface can, thus, be explained as follows. The PDS of the whole pathway changes when Fe is present, leading to a decrease in barrier to be overcome from 1.36 eV to 0.89 eV going from MC to FMC. Moreover, if we compare now the two *NHO intermediates, it is observed that while when Fe is present the energy required to reach this intermediate is 0.89 eV, on the MC surface the energy is increased to 1.15 eV and on FC is 0.95 eV. This is a direct result of enhanced adsorption caused by the upshifted d-band center for the pristine MC surface (Fig. 5b-c). In fact, the d-band energy center has been found at -0.98 eV for the FMC system, and is shifted up to -0.31 eV for the pristine MC surface. The main idea is that the closer to the Fermi energy the metal d-band center is, the stronger the adsorbate-metal interaction is, due to a lower occupation of antibonding states. This is also confirmed by the Bader charge analysis, from which the charge transfer (CT) for selected adsorbed intermediates can be obtained. For the", "page": 16, "position": 0}

Finally, we considered the hydrogen reduction reaction (HER) over the three surfaces. For all three surfaces, the HER is unfavorable compared to the NO3RR. In fact, we observe Gibbs free energy of 1.03, 0.76 and 0.39 eV for the FC, FMC and FC respectively, suggesting that there is little or no competition between the two reactions, and the favored process is the ammonia production. 4. Conclusion In this work, we successfully incorporate Fe in the structure of Mo2C forming a really randomly distributed Fe-Mo carbide (FMC). The resulting FMC exhibits an excellent electrocatalytic activity for the production of ammonia via direct electroreduction of nitrate. The process is successful over a wide concentration range. FMC reaches a NH3 yield of 14.66 mg h cm -2 with an FE of 94.35% at low potential -0.3 V vs RHE. DFT calculations show that the presence of Fe uniformly distributed in the Mo2C lattice changes the relative energy of the reaction intermediates and it is responsible for a diminution of the potential barrier to be overcome from 1.36 eV for pristine MC to 0.89 eV for FMC. In addition, the presence of Fe in the Mo2C structure facilitates the adsorption of intermediates and promote the desorption of NH3, thereby accelerating the reduction of NO3− to NH3. This work provides a new synthesis method for the preparation of mixed Mo carbides and opens up new avenues for collaborative site catalysts. In addition, the synthesized FMC is a suitable cathode for a novel rechargeable Zn-NO3 battery in which in the discharge process the electrons of NO3RR are used to generate electricity, while producing ammonia at the same time, reaching a power density of 3.8 mW/cm2 with a FE to NH3 of 88 %. In the recharge process FMC promotes the OER. The present work first uncovers a convenient sonochemical process to prepare truly mixed Fe-Mo carbide and it shows the excellent electrocatalytic activity of the", "page": 17, "position": 0}
