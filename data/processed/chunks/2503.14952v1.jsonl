In this work we investigate the eﬀect of Mg substitution on the electrochemical and electronic properties of La2−xMgxNi7 materials. The mechanical alloying technique is used to produce a series of La2−xMgxNi7 alloys (x = 0.00, 0.25, 0.50 and 0.75). The X-ray diﬀraction measurements indicates multi-phase character of the samples with majority (La,Mg)2Ni7 phases of hexagonal Ce2Ni7-type and rhombohedral Gd2Co7-type. Electrochemical measurements show how the maximum discharge capacity (Cmax) increases with Mg concentration and that reach the highest value of 304 mAh/g for La1.5Mg0.5Ni7 (x = 0.5). The experimental eﬀorts are followed by the density functional theory (DFT) calculations performed with the full- potential local-orbital minimum-basis scheme (FPLO). To simulate chemical disorder we use the coherent potential approximation (CPA). The calculations are focused on the La1.5Mg0.5Ni7 composition with the highest measured value of Cmax. Additionally, several other structures is considered as reference points. We ﬁnd that hexagonal and rhombohedral structures of La2Ni7 have almost identical total energies which is in a good agreement with a coexistence of both phases in the samples. The calculated site preferences of Mg in both Ce2Ni7-type and Gd2Co7-type La1.5Mg0.5Ni7 phases are consistent with the previous experimental data. Furthermore, the valence band of the nanocrystalline La1.5Mg0.5Ni7 sample is investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The experimental XPS are interpreted based on the corresponding spectra calculated with DFT. 1.

Introduction Metal hydrides (MHx) are one of the most important alternatives for hydrogen storage applications and have a big potential to solve several energy and environmen- tal issues [1]. Metal hydrides can reversibly absorb and desorb hydrogen at ambient pressure and temperature. The microcrystalline hydride materials are conventionally prepared by arc or induction melting and subsequent an- nealing. The hydriding-dehydriding properties of metal hydrides can be improved by introduction of metastable phases and formation of nanocrystalline structures. It can be achieved through the application of a non-equilibrium processing technique, like for example mechanical alloying (MA) [2, 3]. From a perspective of industrial application, an important advantage of the MA process is the fact that the MA allows for production of large quantities of the material, keeping relatively low costs. ∗Corresponding author Email address: werwinski@ifmpan.poznan.pl (Mirosław Werwiński) The recently investigated metal hydrides are the ternary microcrystalline compounds (RE-Mg)2Ni7 (RE = rare-earth metals) [4, 5, 6, 7, 8]. Their hydrogen storage properties proved to be better than the characteristics of the corresponding binary compounds ABn (2 ≤n ≤5) [4]. (RE-Mg)2Ni7 alloys with La or Ce are characterized by high hydrogen capacity, moderate hydrogen equilibrium pressure and relatively inexpensive constituent elements. An open question remains the inﬂuence of Mg substitu- tions in place of RE on the structural, electrochemical and electronic characteristics of (RE-Mg)2Ni7 alloys. This work continues our previous research on La-Mg- Ni alloys and composites [9, 10, 11]. An objective of this study is to investigate the inﬂuence of Mg concen- tration on the electrochemical and electronic properties of La2−xMgxNi7 materials. The series of La2−xMgxNi7 al- loys (with x = 0.00, 0.25, 0.50 and 0.75) is produced by the MA technique. The experimental eﬀorts of materials preparation and characterization are followed by theoreti- cal studies based on the density functional theory (DFT). The (La,Mg)2Ni7 systems have been investigated by DFT before. Crivello et al. [12] presented a systematic study Preprint submitted to Elsevier March 20, 2025", "page": 0, "position": 1}

In the next paper Crivello et al. [6] present a systematic DFT study on distribution of hydrogen in La2Ni7, Mg2Ni7 and La1.5Mg0.5Ni7 hosts, however the calculations were lim- ited to the Ce2Ni7 prototype. In both mentioned works the Mg alloying was modeled based on the ordered com- pound method. Furthermore, as the surveys focus on the systems stability, no results of valence band investigations were presented. The valence band of isostructural hexag- onal La2Co7 has been shown before. [13] 2. Experimental and Computational Details This sections covers the details of preparation of La2−xMgxNi7 samples and reference elemental thin ﬁlms. The applied characterization techniques, which are X- ray diﬀraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and electrochemical measurements are also de- scribed. Finally, the computational parameters of ab initio calculations are given. 2.1. Materials Preparation For preparation of the samples we used the La powder – grated from rod (Alfa Aesar, 99.9%), Mg powder (Alfa Aesar, -325 mesh, 99.8%), and Ni powder (Aldrich, 5 µm, 99.99%) were used. La2−xMgxNi7 (x = 0.00, 0.25, 0.50, and 0.75) alloys powders were prepared by the MA and an- nealing process. The MA was performed using the SPEX 8000 Mixer Mill. A protective argon atmosphere was ap- plied. Elemental powders (La, Mg, Ni) were weighted, blended and poured into vials in glove box (Labmaster 130) ﬁlled with controlled argon atmosphere (O2 < 2 ppm and H2O < 1 ppm). A composition of starting materials mixture was based on a stoichiometry of an ideal reaction. However, due to oxidation of La and Mg the content of theses element was increased by 8 wt%. The amount of La and Mg extra addition (8 wt%) was determined dur- ing our basic research (not shown here), in order to obtain after MA process and annealing, materials with chemi- cal composition as close as it is", "page": 1, "position": 0}

The amount of La and Mg extra addition (8 wt%) was determined dur- ing our basic research (not shown here), in order to obtain after MA process and annealing, materials with chemi- cal composition as close as it is possible to stoichiometry of an ideal reaction. In all cases the MA process lasted for 48 h in argon atmosphere. In all cases the as-milled materials were heat treated in high purity argon atmo- sphere at 1123 K for 0.5 h. Furthermore for the refer- ence reasons in XPS characterization the standard La, Mg, and Ni thin ﬁlms with thicknesses of about 200 nm were prepared at room temperature using computer-controlled UHV magnetron co-sputtering [14]. Ni and Mg (La) tar- gets were sputtered using DC and RF modes, respectively. The base pressure before the deposition process was lower than 5 × 10−10 mbar. As a substrate we used Si(100) wafers with an oxidized surface to prevent a silicide for- mation. Therefore we applied a special heat treatment in ultra high vacuum (UHV) before deposition in order to obtain an epitaxial SiO2 surface layer [15, 16]. The dis- tance between sputtering targets and substrate was about 220 mm. Typical sputtering conditions are listed in Tab. 1. The chemical composition and the cleanness of all layers was checked in situ immediately after deposition. The samples were transferred to an UHV (4 × 10−11 mbar) analysis chamber equipped with XPS, Auger electron spec- troscopy (AES) and ion gun etching system.

Structural Characterization The crystallographic structures of the La2−xMgxNi7 samples were investigated at room temperature using the Panalytical Empyrean XRD with Cu Kα1 (λ = 1.54056 Å) radiation. The conditions of XRD measurements were: voltage 45 kV, anode current 40 mA and 2 Theta range 20°–80°. 2.3. Electrochemical Measurements Mechanically alloyed and annealed materials, in nanocrystalline form, with 10 wt.% addition of Ni pow- der, were used to form metal-hydride electrodes. Mate- rials were pressed (1050 MPa) with nickel nets acting as current collector to 0.5 g pellets. The diameter of each electrode was 8.0 mm and the weight was approximately 0.3 g. Initial activation was carried out by soaking of the electrode in 6 M KOH for 24 h at room temperature. Electrochemical measurements were made using the Multi- channel Battery Interface ATLAS 0461 and ATLAS 0961. Studies were done in an open three-compartment glass cell, using a much larger NiOOH/Ni(OH)2 counter elec- trode and a mercury oxide (Hg/HgO/6 M KOH) reference 2", "page": 1, "position": 2}

All electrochemical measurements were carried out in deaerated 6 M KOH solution prepared from pure KOH and 18 MΩ/cm water, at temperature of about 293 K. Cycle stability (Rh) of materials was evaluated by capacity retaining rate after n cycle: Rh = (Cn/Cmax)×100%, where Cn and Cmax are discharge ca- pacities at the n-th cycle and maximum discharge capacity, respectively. 2.4. XPS Measurements The XPS spectra were measured at room temperature using the SPECS EA 10 PLUS energy spectrometer with Al-Kα radiation of 1486.6 eV. For the XPS valence band measurements we used a step size equal to 0.05 eV. The en- ergy spectra of the electrons were analyzed by a hemispher- ical analyzer (FWHMMg−Kα equals 0.8 eV for Ag 3d5/2). Calibration of the spectra was performed according to Baer et al. [17]. The emission spectra of La, Mg and Ni were measured immediately after the sample transfer from the preparation chamber in a vacuum of 8 × 10−11 mbar. The 4f7/2 peak of gold was situated at 84.0 eV and the Fermi level was located at binding energy 0 eV. The sur- face layer with impurities (∼10 nm) of the studied bulk nanocrystalline samples could be removed using a SPECS ion gun etching system. We have used 3 keV Ar+ ion beam that was incident at an angle of 45° to the surface of the sample [18]. The measurements were conducted following routine backing procedures (T = 440 K) of the analysis chamber which made possible reaching a base vacuum of 4 × 10−11 mbar. Details of the XPS measurements can be found in Refs. [14, 19, 20]. 2.5.

The utilized FPLO5.00 version of the code is the latest public version allowing for the calcula- tions within coherent potential approximation (CPA) [23]. The CPA was used to computationally model a chemi- cal disorder as introduced to crystal structures of La2Ni7 by substituting Mg on La sites. The form of CPA im- plementation in the FPLO5 prevents us from applying full-relativistic scheme and allows to use only a scalar- relativistic one. Nevertheless, the constituent light ele- ments (La, Mg, Ni) and the scope of this study justify the application of this approach. Moreover, the additional full relativistic calculations made by us conﬁrm this as- sumption. For all calculations we use the local density approximation (PW92) [24], optimization of the basis, 163 k-mesh and convergence criterion of charge density 10−6. One exception is the La1.5Mg0.5Ni7 in Ce2Ni7-type struc- ture for which we had to limit the k-mesh down to 63. Although the hexagonal La2Ni7 undergoes an antiferro- magnetic transition at TN = 51 K [25], we consider only non-magnetic models as consistent with the non-magnetic states of the samples in room temperature. The theoret- ical photoemission spectra were obtained from the calcu- lated densities of electronic states convoluted by Gaussian with a half-width (δ) equal to 0.6 eV and scaled using the proper photoelectronic cross-sections for partial states [26]. This method we have successfully used before to calculate photoemission spectra of CeRh3Si2 and UGe2 [27, 28]. The intention for convolution by Gaussian is to mimic a lifetime of hole states, an experimental broadening from instrumental resolution and thermal eﬀects. The value of δ = 0.6 eV is selected as close to the value identiﬁed for the spectrometer used for measurements.

The activation capability of an alloy electrode is related to the change of the internal energy of the hydride system before and after hydrogen absorption [5]. The electrochemical properties of the alloy depends on multiple factors, involving its crystal structure, phase composition and microstructure. Most of the electrodes display maximum discharge capacity (Cmax) during the ﬁrst three cycles. Cmax is increasing with Mg content to reach the highest value (304 mAh/g) for x = 0.5 (La1.5Mg0.5Ni7). Further increase of Mg concentration causes decrease of Cmax. The same tendency was observed in pressure-composition-temperature (PCT) tests [11]. The degradation of discharge capacity in La-Mg-Ni alloys originates from forming and increasing of Mg(OH)2 and La(OH)3 surface layers. These oxides hinder the hydrogen atoms from diﬀusion in or out in alkaline solutions [38].

It is due to the phase composition of this material. In La1.25Mg0.75Ni7 alloy, except the main (La,Mg)2Ni7 phase, the LaNi5 phase is observed, which possesses much higher electrochemical cycle stability than (La,Mg)2Ni7 phase [39]. Taking into account the Cmax, a sample with the most promising composition is La1.5Mg0.5Ni7 (x = 0.5) and further investigations presented in this work will focus on it. 3.3. XPS Measurements It has been shown that the formation of metal hydrides follows the rules of semi-empirical models [40, 41], which characteristic parameters depend on the features of the valence band.

Instead of investigating the whole range of La2−xMgxNi7 compositions with the XPS, we fo- cus on the La1.5Mg0.5Ni7 sample which, among the inves- tigated series, exhibited the highest value of discharge ca- pacity (Cmax = 304 mAh/g). As reference we study with XPS also the bulk nanocrystalline La2Ni7 sample and in situ prepared La, Mg and Ni thin ﬁlms. The XPS spectra of the elemental thin ﬁlms suggest that the main contri- bution to the La2Ni7 and La1.5Mg0.5Ni7 valence bands comes from the 3d electrons of Ni. The full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the La2Ni7 and La1.5Mg0.5Ni7 va- lence bands are about 2.7 eV and 2.2 eV, respectively. The narrowing of the La1.5Mg0.5Ni7 valence band could be ex- plained by increase of amount of the La oxide phase in the surface layer. This concept will be investigated in the next section covering the ab initio results. Note, that the XPS signal originates mainly from the surface layer (3– 5 nm) [18, 42]. Furthermore, in Ref. [18] we showed that La atoms segregate to the surface of the nanocrystalline LaNi5-type alloys and form stable oxides under ambient conditions.

Therefore, the valence band of the nanocrys- talline La1.5Mg0.5Ni7 is narrower compared to that mea- sured for the La2Ni7 alloy. Theoretical XPS valence bands calculated for perfect crystalline materials without segre- gation and oxidation eﬀects are practically the same, see Sec. 3.4.2. Furthermore, looking from other perspective, such an additional surface oxide layer could inﬂuence hy- drogen absorption and electrochemical properties of the studied material, as has been recently reported for the well deﬁned Mg/Pd bilayers with La interlayer [43]. 3.4. Density Functional Theory Calculations In DFT calculations, similar like in the XPS measure- ments, we focus on the La1.5Mg0.5Ni7 sample with the highest Cmax instead of considering the whole concentra- tion range of Mg. It has been shown that the inhomo- geneous La1.5Mg0.5Ni7 sample consists, among others, of La1.5Mg0.5Ni7 in Ce2Ni7-type and Gd2Co7-type phases, LaNi5 and La2O3, see Tab. 7. Furthermore, for the neigh- boring composition (LaMgNi7) Crivello et al. [12] sug- gested an energetically stable state with LaNi5 phase co- existing with MgNi2. The above observations are the rea- son why we decide to investigate theoretically the several phases mentioned above. That list has been extended by the reference phases: Ce2Ni7-type and Gd2Co7-type of La2Ni7 and fcc Ni. This analysis is designed to answer the questions of the energetic stability of the particular phases and to better understand the electronic properties and the nature of La1.5Mg0.5Ni7 valence band (studied in this work also by XPS). The basic structural data of the considered phases are collected in Tabs. 2, 3, 4 and 5. For graphical representation of crystallographic structures see Fig. 1. 3.4.1. Site preference and phase stability Our calculations on LaNi5, La2O3, MgNi2 and fcc Ni are dedicated to resolve the measured XPS valence band of inhomogeneous samples. However nearly 90% of the La1.5Mg0.5Ni7 composition consists of Ce2Ni7-type and Gd2Co7-type phases, see Tab. 7. This is why the latter phases are the main subject of our DFT study.

Although the basic La2Ni7 phases can be simulated based on the simple ordered structures, the modeling of the systems with chemical disorder is more demanding. Previously the La2−xMgxNi7systems with Mg have been modeled based on the ordered compound method [6, 12]. In this work the chemical disorder introduced by Mg substitution on La sites is considered based on the coherent potential approx- imation (CPA). One of the advantages of CPA method is that it allows for any arbitrary concentration and not only x = 0.5, 1.0 or 1.5. We have applied the CPA before to model Nb and Ti substitutions in YCo2 [44]. Experimental observations of phase composition indi- cate about 46 wt.% shares of hexagonal Ce2Ni7-type and rhombohedral Gd2Co7-type phases in our La2Ni7 samples, see Tab. 7. The formation of signiﬁcant amounts of both phases suggests small energy diﬀerence between them, which ﬁnds a conﬁrmation in nearly identical heats of for- mation calculated by Crivello et al. [12] for La2Ni7 in two above structure types. So good energy balance between both types of structures comes form a close relationship between them, consisting both of LaNi2 and LaNi5 unit blocks [12]. The total energy comparison made by us indi- cates that both structure types have nearly the same total energies with a small preference of about 10 meV/atom in favor of Gd2Co7-type which is in good agreement with the previous results [12]. Furthermore, the total energy comparison between hexagonal and rhombohedral phases of La5Ni19 [7] indicates a very small preference of about 1.4 meV/atom in favor of hexagonal phase. The above re- sults of small energy diﬀerences together with the heats of formation calculated by Crivello et al. [12] suggest that in the whole La-Ni-Mg system might be diﬃcult to ﬁnd preference of hexagonal or rhombohedral-type structures.

[12] suggest that in the whole La-Ni-Mg system might be diﬃcult to ﬁnd preference of hexagonal or rhombohedral-type structures. In La1.5Mg0.5Ni7 samples with 25% doping of Mg on La sites also occur hexagonal Ce2Ni7-type and rhombohe- dral Gd2Co7-type phases. In order to describe site pref- erences for Mg, both structure types have to be consid- ered. Zhang et al. [45] determined from Rietveld analysis that the Mg atoms are located only on the 4f La1 sites (in Laves unit blocks LaNi2) of hexagonal La1.5Mg0.5Ni7 phase (Ce2Ni7-type), see Tab. 3. The same conclusions were drawn once again by Denys et al. [37]. The beneﬁ- cial conditions for Mg substitution on La 4f1 site (∆E ∼ 60 meV/atom) were also predicted with DFT [12]. We have once again attempted to determine the Mg site prefer- ences in La1.5Mg0.5Ni7 (Ce2Ni7-type), but this time based on the CPA models. We consider Mg atoms located at 4f1 sites, 4f2 sites or randomly distributed between them. Our total energy calculations show that the most stable conﬁg- uration is when the Mg atoms are located at La 4f1 sites, and the least probable is random distribution of dopants between 4f1 and 4f2 sites. The diﬀerence in total en- ergy between these conﬁgurations is about 70 meV/atom, which is relatively large value and suggests rather strong preference, even above room temperature. For Gd2Co7-type phase of La1.5Mg0.5Ni7 Zhang et al. [34] determined experimentally that Mg atoms prefer to occupy the La2 6c2 sites, however together with mi- nor tendency towards the La1 6c1 sites, see Tabs. 4 and 5. Based on the DFT calculations Crivello et al. [12] also indicated for Gd2Co7-type phase of La1.5Mg0.5Ni7 the 6c2 sites preference of Mg (∆E ∼60 meV/atom). In case of La1.5Mg0.5Ni7 sample our diﬀraction reﬁne- ment indicates 16% of Ce2Ni7-type and 72.9% of Gd2Co7- type phase, see Tab. 7. Previously Zhang", "page": 6, "position": 2}

Concluding, the La2Ni7 and La1.5Mg0.5Ni7 phases are stable in both hexagonal Ce2Ni7-type and rhombo- hedral Gd2Co7-type structures. In La1.5Mg0.5Ni7 phase the Mg site preferences are 4f1 in hexagonal and 6c2 in rhombohedral structure types. These two ground state La1.5Mg0.5Ni7 structures, together with two La2Ni7 struc- tures will be considered in the next section devoted to the analysis of the valence band. 3.4.2. Valence band analysis Our valence band DFT calculations are dedicated both as (1) interpretation for experimental XPS and (2) self- standing results shedding light on the electronic structure of the La1.5Mg0.5Ni7 and at the same time ﬁlling the gap in understanding of the system. The valence bands of both La2Ni7 and La1.5Mg0.5Ni7 phases in hexagonal Ce2Ni7- type and rhombohedral Gd2Co7-type structures are pre- sented in Fig. 6. There is not much diﬀerences between the densities of states (DOS) calculated for hexagonal and rhombohedral phases. The main part of the valence bands start in each case about -5.0 eV and ﬁnish soon after Fermi energy (EF). In every case two main maxima (at -2.3 and -0.8 eV) and characteristic sharp peak around EF are ob- served. The main contributions to the valence bands come from the Ni 3d bands, see Fig. 7(a), and resemble the va- lence band of the bcc Ni, see Fig. 7(d). As Mg atoms have one less valence electron than La ones the substitution of Mg in place of La in La2Ni7 slightly depopulates the valence band. In terms of rigid band approximation the Fermi level (EF) of La1.5Mg0.5Ni7 shifts a little bit left towards the higher binding energies, see Figs. 7(b) and (c). It is observed that the Ni atoms in La1.5Mg0.5Ni7 have about 0.4 less of 3d electrons per band than in La2Ni7. In case of La2Ni7 even a small change in valence band occupation may signiﬁcantly af- fect the conduction properties of the material, as the sharp peak", "page": 7, "position": 0}

In case of La2Ni7 even a small change in valence band occupation may signiﬁcantly af- fect the conduction properties of the material, as the sharp peak is located at the Fermi level. In fact, the Mg sub- stitution in La1.5Mg0.5Ni7 reduces the value of DOS(EF) from about 30 to 11 states/(eV f.u.) for hexagonal Ce2Ni7- type structure and from about 29 to 14 states/(eV f.u.) for the rhombohedral Gd2Co7-type structure. These values of DOS(EF) correspond to the parameter γ in linear term of speciﬁc heat of 72 and 25 mJ/(mol K2) for hexagonal and 68 and 34 mJ/(mol K2) for rhombohedral structure, re- spectively. The above values of DOS(EF) and γ consist mainly of contributions from Ni electrons (above 95%). In Fig. 5 we present the measured XPS valence band spectra of bulk nanocrystalline La2Ni7 and La1.5Mg0.5Ni7 alloys. As the XPS resolution is limited the observed spectra are rather fuzzy.

This number is much bigger than experimental 2.2 eV for La1.5Mg0.5Ni7 sample and from theory we can conclude that the narrowing of experimental XPS of La1.5Mg0.5Ni7 in respect to La2Ni7 cannot be explained based on the sin- gle phase arguments.

However, the eﬀect of narrowing can be related to the presence of the oxide phase La2O3, which valence band showed in Fig. 6(g) is noticeably narrower from the remaining Ni compounds. In fact, the presence of 3.1 wt.% of La2O3 phase have been observed in La1.5Mg0.5Ni7 sample. The theoretical XPS spectra presented in Fig. 7(e) were obtained from the partial DOS’s convoluted by Gaussians with a half-width δ equal to 0.6 eV. For smaller δ the XPS spectra would reveal more features of valence band, see Fig. 7(f). The broadening parameter δ of our XPS equipment is how- ever only about 0.4–0.5 eV. Therefore, the double-peak structure observed in theoretical XPS for δ = 0.3 eV, see Fig. 7(f), could not be directly observed experimentally, see Fig. 5.

The broaden- ing of the experimental valence band of the nanocrystalline La2Ni7 alloy could be explained by a strong deformation of the nanocrystals in mechanically alloyed and heat treated samples [46]. For such nanocrystalline samples the inte- rior of the nanocrystal is constrained and the distances be- tween atoms located at the grain boundaries expanded. In Ref. [20] we have compared the XPS valence bands of me- chanically alloyed bulk nanocrystalline LaNi4.2Al0.8 and high-purity poly- and nanocrystalline LaNi4Al thin ﬁlms. For this case we have also observed the valence band broad- ening in the thin ﬁlm and bulk nanocrystalline material in relation to the polycrystalline sample. 4. Summary and Conclusions We studied the eﬀect of substitution La by Mg on electrochemical and electronic properties in La2−xMgxNi7 phases. The experimental preparation and character- ization part was followed by the detailed DFT study. First, the series of La2−xMgxNi7 samples (with x = 0.00, 0.25, 0.50 and 0.75) was obtained by mechanical alloying. Next, they were characterized by XRD, XPS and electro- chemical measurements. We concluded that the resultant La2Ni7 samples have the multi-phase character and con- sist mainly of Ce2Ni7-type and Gd2Co7-type structures of (La,Mg)2Ni7, with minor contributions of LaNi5 and La2O3 phases. Best electrochemical properties (maximum discharge capacity) were identiﬁed for La1.5Mg0.5Ni7 sam- ple. This composition was then a subject of the XPS in- vestigations covering the valence band and reference sam- ples of La, Mg, Ni and La2Ni7. The main contribution from Ni electrons to valence band was established.

The main contribution from Ni electrons to valence band was established. The observed narrowing of the La1.5Mg0.5Ni7 valence band in respect to La2Ni7 is supposed to be caused by increase of the lanthanum oxide phase concentration. With DFT calculations we focused also on the La1.5Mg0.5Ni7 sam- ple, although we considered also the other phases identi- ﬁed by XRD in our multi-phase samples. Our ab initio analysis was intended to investigate the energetic stabil- ity of the La2−xMgxNi7 phases and to provide informa- tion on the La1.5Mg0.5Ni7 valence band. In face of lack of experimental data, ﬁrst we determined the atomic po- sitions for Gd2Co7-type La2Ni7-phase by structure opti- mization. We identiﬁed the Gd2Co7-type phases as only slightly more stable than the Ce2Ni7-type for both La2Ni7 and La1.5Mg0.5Ni7 phases. For modeling of the Mg substi- tution in La1.5Mg0.5Ni7 phases we used the coherent po- tential approximation. We conclude from calculations that the Mg atoms prefer to occupy La 4f1 sites for Ce2Ni7-type La1.5Mg0.5Ni7 phase and the La 6c2 positions for Gd2Co7- type phase. These results stay in good agreement with the previous experimental and theoretical statements. The stability analysis was followed by the valence band investi- gations – primarily dedicated to interpret the experimental XPS spectra.
