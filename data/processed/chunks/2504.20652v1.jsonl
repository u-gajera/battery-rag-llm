This study explores the two-dimensional, 18-crown-6-like N8 structure (2D-N8) as a promising electrode material for next-generation rechargeable post-lithium batteries. We thoroughly investigated the pristine N8 structures, focusing on their stability and performance metrics. Our analysis revealed remarkable structural stability across the board. Additionally, electronic calculations indicated a small band gap of 0.54 eV for the N8 monolayer, suggesting fa- vorable electronic properties for battery applications. When we evaluated a series of metal ions as adsorbates, we found that the pristine N8 monolayer achieved an impressive storage capacity of 1675 mAh/g for sodium (Na) and magnesium (Mg) ions, highlighting its potential for effective ion storage.

Introduction Developing renewable and environmentally friendly energy sources is es- sential, as fossil fuel resources are finite and harmful to the ecosystem [1, 2, 3]. Rechargeable batteries represent a promising choice in the current energy storage landscape, as they must meet high-energy-density, safety, and afford- ability requirements. Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) were first introduced to the market in 1991 by Sony Corp., quickly gaining popularity due to their impressive features, such as extended cycle life and high energy density [4, 5]. The scarcity of lithium reserves restricts the application of lithium-ion bat- teries and drives their costs. Furthermore, the theoretical specific capacity of graphite, frequently used as the anode material in LIBs, is 372 mAh/g, below the demand for most practical applications [6]. Thus, the importance of post- lithium ion batteries, including sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) [7], potassium ion batteries (KIBs) [8], magnesium ion batteries (MgIBs) [9], and calcium ion batteries (CaIBs) [10] should not be overlooked. Sodium and potassium are located directly below lithium in the periodic table, which means these three elements have similar chemical properties. Their abundance in Earth’s resources and lower extraction cost compared to lithium make them promis- ing candidates for use in next-generation battery systems [11]. Magnesium and calcium batteries tend to have a more stable electrochemical profile, which can lead to improved safety [12, 13]. Because they usually operate at lower standard electrode potentials, the risk of dendrite growth may be lower. The electrochemical performance of post-lithium ion batteries at the electrodes is somewhat limited due to the larger atomic radii of post-lithium metals, resulting in a relatively lower storage capacity, poorer ionic diffu- sion, and larger volume changes in the anode [14]. Consequently, designing new electrode materials with high energy density, storage capacity, and ion mobility is crucial while exhibiting negligible expansion and contraction for post-lithium-ion batteries. Two-dimensional (2D) materials exhibit significant advantages as poten- tial cathode candidates compared to conventional materials [15]. This is because of their extensive specific surface area, multiple adsorption sites, and outstanding mechanical strength. Currently, a variety of abundant 2D electrodes, including borophene [16], silicene [17], phosphorene [18],", "page": 6, "position": 0}

This instability can negatively affect the overall lifespan and performance of the battery. Although black phosphorene exhibits excellent rate performance and a high specific capacity, significant volume variation during the charge and discharge processes hinders its practical use [23]. Incorporating transition metals tends to increase the molar mass of electrode materials, potentially reducing the specific capacity. WSe2 and MoS2 as transition metal dichalco- genides suffer from low electronic conductivity, thus deteriorating their low charge mobility. Finally, the adsorption capacity and diffusion barrier of multivalent ions are significantly influenced by the terminal groups on MX- enes, which affect the theoretical capacity and the charge/discharge rates of batteries [24]. Therefore, there is a strong demand for 2D electrode ma- terials that demonstrate exceptional overall performance. Developing such materials for metal-ion batteries continues to be a significant challenge. Polynitrogen-containing materials, characterized by high nitrogen con- tent and unique structural properties, have attracted increasing attention in energy storage and conversion due to their high energy density and ease of electron transfer [25]. However, one of the notable drawbacks of polynitrogen- containing materials is their instability. A proven approach to improving the stability of polynitrogen compounds is to create a nitrogen network that in- corporates both N-N and N=N bonds and to develop nitrogen-rich alloys with other elements [26]. Strengthening the interactions between metal cations and anionic polynitrogen structures can lead to the development of novel high-energy density materials. Recent advances in synthetic methodologies have facilitated the design and optimization of polynitrogen compounds, re- vealing their intriguing physicochemical properties, such as high stability, energetic output, and tunable reactivity [27, 28, 29, 30]. In 2017, by Steele and Oleynik [31] the new P6/mcc KN8 compound was predicted at 70 GPa by evolutionary algorithms and the methodology of func- tional density theory. More recently, Wang et al. [32] claimed that the usage of noble gas and high pressure may stabilize the nitrogen to form crown- shaped structures known as 18-crown-6-like-N8. It was demonstrated that the 2D-N8 layers persist to ambient pressure on decompression after the", "page": 7, "position": 0}

[34] extended the first investigation by predicting the new structures of porous polynitrogen that accommodate metal ions. The structure was designated as 2D-N8, derived from the predicted high-pressure stable layered compound XeN8 at 100 GPa [33]. The resulting structures of a covalent nitrogen monolayer 2D-N8 consist of a ring containing six N=N units and six three-coordinated nitrogen atoms in sp3 hybridization. Motivated by the previous theoretical predictions and experimental real- ization, the present study aims to perform comprehensive calculations of the geometry, stability, and electronic properties calculation of the 2D-N8 struc- ture. The adsorption characteristics of metal ions commonly used in battery applications will be specifically examined. Subsequently, the adsorption en- ergies of the Li, Na, Mg, K, Ca, S, and Zn metals in the pristine 2D-N8 structure will be investigated. The studied system’s theoretical storage ca- pacity (TSC) and open-circuit voltage (OCV) with adsorbed metals will be evaluated. Finally, the calculated migration energy barriers for the metals will be analyzed. The paper is organized as follows. Sec. 2 contains computational details and formulas used for all property predictions, including stability check, elec- tronic properties, and evaluation of battery material performance.

Electronic structure calculation parameters Geometric and electronic properties of the pristine and boron-doped 18- crown-6-like-N8 structures before and after the intercalation of the metal- ions were carried out by DFT calculations implemented in Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP) [35], using the plane wave basis set with an en- ergy cutoff of 520 eV, the projected augmented wave potentials (PAW) [36]. The generalized gradient approximation (GGA) with the Perdew, Burke, and Ernzerhof functional (PBE) is utilized for the exchange-correlation func- tional [37].

The lattice parameters of pristine N8 monolayers’ unit cell, obtained after full relaxation, were found to be a = b = 5.925 ˚A. Periodic boundary conditions were applied in two dimensions, x and y, while a vacuum region longer than 20 ˚A along the z-direction was set to avoid interactions between adjacent layers, ensuring isolation of a single layer as indicated in the unit cell representation of Fig. 1.

Dynamic and thermal calculation parameters The kinetic process of diffusion pathways and the energy barrier was calculated using the nudged elastic band method of the climbing image (CI- NEB) [41], and the intermediate images were relaxed until the forces were less than 0.03 eV/˚A. To explore the dynamic stability of the N8 monolayer, the phonon dispersion spectrum was calculated using the finite displacement method implemented in VASP. Ab initio molecular dynamics simulations (AIMD) were performed within the NVT ensemble and the Nose-Goover thermostat with a time step of 2 fs and a total simulation time of 20 ps at 500 K to evaluate the thermal stability. 2.3. Mechanical properties calculation parameters and formulas Mechanical stability was evaluated by calculating the elastic constants. The hexagonal phase of the monolayer used in the calculations is character- ized by three constants: C11=C22, which represent the material’s in-plane stiffness under uniaxial strain applied in the x or y direction; C12, which de- scribes resistance to biaxial deformation; and C66, which quantifies resistance to distortion caused by shear stress. 5", "page": 9, "position": 0}

To check the metal-ion-adsorbed thermodynamic stability the idea of a convex hull is convenient to use. For the case of a system with added ions and the fixed composition of host material, the following equation can be consequently obtained [43, 44]: Eform = (Emetal-N8 −(Ebare + x · Emetal)) /(x + 1).

Changes in entropy and volume during a half-cell reaction are often assumed to be minimal and insignifi- cant [45]. Therefore, the open-circuit voltage is calculated as the following equation: OCV = −Eads zF , (13) where z is the number of valence electrons (z = 1 for Li, Na and K, z = 2 for Ca and Mg).

Stability analysis The stability of model materials refers to the analysis and prediction of how materials behave under various conditions. It allows us to predict how a material will perform in real-world situations, such as extreme temperatures, pressures, or chemical environments, without physically testing it in all sce- narios. Here are some key aspects of the stability of the modeled materials: thermal, kinetic, mechanic, thermodynamic, and electronic. The thermal stability of the system has been checked by AIMD simula- tions at 500 K, and the variation of the potential energy during the simulation is presented in Fig. 1 a. The N8 monolayer demonstrates good thermal sta- bility. It maintains the initial configurations after 10 ps with holes similar to the equilibrium structure and preserving the bond lengths. (a) (b) Figure 2: (a) AIMD at 500 K for 2×2-cell of N8 monolayer, (b) variation of the total energy with applied uniaxial strain along the x-axis, and y-axis, and the biaxial strain along the x and y-axis. The mechanical stability is essential in designing high-capacity cathode materials. Mechanical stability focuses on how a material responds to phys- ical stresses (e.g., tension, compression, or shear). Models assess whether a material will deform, fracture, or retain its structural integrity under these forces. The pristine N8 monolayer satisfies the mechanical stability criteria of Eqs. (4)-(6). The stress-strain curves shown in Fig. 2 b, were computed to estimate the elastic constants and mechanical properties. The evaluated elas- tic constants are C11 = C22 = 621.7 GPa, C12 = 145.4 GPa, C66 = 238.1 GPa. 8", "page": 12, "position": 0}

Phonon spectra show the dynamical stability of the system. Namely, if any calculated phonon modes exhibit imaginary frequencies, it indicates that the structure is dynamically unstable. This typically might point out to distortions or phase transitions. The calculated phonon dispersions for 2D- N8 monolayer in the structure depicted in Fig. 1 possess imaginary phonon frequencies. This negative phonon mode is associated with the translational movement of the whole monolayer in the z-direction. Reduced dimensional- ity often heightens the effect of long-range interactions, making the system more susceptible to instabilities. Consequently, in 2D systems, these interac- tions can cause the phonon modes responsible for out-of-plane displacements to become less stable, leading to negative [46]. To find a dynamically stable configuration, we first constructed a layered bulk structure with a reduced plane-to-plane distance between monolayers and fully optimized it. The most energetically stable configuration was found to be in the form of twisted monolayers. This structure was confirmed to be dynamically stable with no imaginary frequencies. After that, three monolayers were surrounded by thick vacuum space as shown in SFig. 1 of Supplementary. In this case, the optimized distance between monolayers is 3.5 ˚A. The corresponding phonon dispersion curves are presented in SFig. 2 a, where positive frequencies indi- cate favorable dynamical stability. We also calculated the binding energy re- quired to exfoliate one monolayer of N8 from the constructed bulk material. The resulting binding energy, Ebinding, is minimal, equal to 0.04 eV/atom, demonstrating that the monolayer can easily be formed. In addition, we also present the phonon curves for a single N8 monolayer with an adsorbed metal ion, which, as we see in SFig. 2 b, stabilize the studied monolayer. In semiconductors and other electronic materials, the stability of elec- tronic structures is crucial. If the material’s band structure or electron configuration is unstable, it may not function correctly in electronic devices. Small-size band-gap semiconductors are promising materials for metal-ion battery cathodes. Moreover, metallic materials are desirable for both anode and cathode materials", "page": 13, "position": 0}

These bands in electronic systems are of significant interest because they imply unique and potentially transformative electronic properties. In a flat band, the energy of the electronic states is nearly constant, which means that the electrons in these states have almost no kinetic energy. This results in a high density of electronic states at the same energy, which can enhance interactions between electrons, such as those leading to superconductivity, magnetism, or other correlated phenomena. That might be the subject of further investigation. The electron localization function (ELF) (Fig. 3 b) was calculated to de- scribe electron localization in the material quantitatively. ELF values range from 0 to 1, where values close to 1 indicate strong electron localization (e.g., in covalent bonds), values near 0 correspond to delocalized electrons (e.g., in metals), and 0.5 represents the electron-gas state. The following color cod- ing is commonly used in ELF visualization. The high ELF values between the nitrogen atoms in the 2D-N8 layers indicate strong covalent bonds that stabilize its 2D structure. Thermodynamic stability describes whether a material is in its most stable state, which means that it has the lowest possible energy configuration. Computational models can help predict whether a material will remain stable or whether it might undergo a phase change or decomposition over time. N8 adsorption characteristics of Li, K, Ca, Na, Mg, S, and Zn were tested. To assess thermodynamic stability, the formation energy using Eq. (11) was calculated and plotted in SFig. 3. The formation energies versus the metal-ion content form a convex hull that connects the lowest formation energies. The structures in the convex hull represent stable configurations. It is seen that the N8 monolayer forms stable configurations with considered metal-ions. 10", "page": 14, "position": 0}

The exact positions at the maximum possible concentration for selected metal ions will be described in detail in the following sections.

In the next stage, the electrochemical efficiency of the 2D electrode material will be analyzed by carefully calculating the adsorption energies for an increasing number of metal ions on the surface of the electrode material.

In particular, one Li-ion per unit cell occupies the middle of the pores, whereas the increased ions are distributed above the surface homogeneously. Na-ions adsorption was analyzed in the same way. The main difference from Li is that the number of adsorbed ions per unit cell increases significantly as presented in Fig. 5. We see that 7 K-ions homogeneously occupy the pore between N-N bonds, forming a few layers that are located equidistant above the monolayer. At the same time, one ion occupies the position within the surface slightly below it. A similar feature was observed for Mg-ions when up to 7 ions might be effectively adsorbed.

All investigated metal-ions form thermodynamically stable structures, as confirmed by AIMD simulations at 500 K, as presented in SFig. 4. The energy evolution in time shows that the structure remains planar, preserving the initial crown-type structure. An additional aspect of the stability of the 2D-N8 monolayer is that the presence of metal ions on the monolayer leads to the dynamic stabilization of the system. As was discussed in Sec. 3.1.1 the monolayer N8 surrounded with a vacuum higher than 3.16 ˚A leads to the occurrence of imaginary frequencies. However, no negative modes are observed when metals are adsorbed (SFig. 5). 3.1.3. Adsorption of Li/Na/Mg/K/Ca metal ions and battery performance characteristics The electrochemical efficiency of electrode material in metal-ion batter- ies is mainly characterized by strong metal bonding on the material surface. In other words, the host material must exhibit strong adsorption and corre- spondingly large negative adsorption energy. The adsorption energies were calculated according to Eq. (10) and plot- ted in Fig. 6 for all the ions considered. We present the only regions with negative adsorption energies and stable configurations achieved during op- timization. The situations depicted in Fig. 5 correspond to the rightmost point on the graphs. We obtained that the pristine N8 monolayer can form a stable configuration with negative adsorption energy with a maximum of 4/7/7/7/3 ions of Li/Na/Mg/K/Ca adsorbed on one side. Interestingly, the formation energy curve for Na and Mg ends up with a plateau when a higher amount of adsorbed ions on one side with negative energy is hypothetically possible. The increased number of adsorbed ions leads to unstable structures, which can be overcome by placing the ions on the other side of the 2D-N8 mono- layer. That type of adsorption is also thermodynamically stable. Moreover, the adsorption energy comes to a plateau for an amount of metal-ions larger than 4. However,", "page": 17, "position": 0}

The calculated adsorption energy for both single monolayer and three-layered structures are the same. The OCV and TCS calculated by Eqs. (13) and (14) are presented in Fig. 6. The highest TSCs calculated for the Na and Mg ions are 1675 mAh/g. These values are much higher than for graphene (372 mAh/g [47]). The OCV range is an important characteristic since it indicates the potential of the cathode material to store metal-ions during discharging. The high mean OCV values for all metal-ions were found, which is desirable for cathode materials [48]. The described exothermic adsorption process often results in the forma- tion of metallic clusters. Indeed, during the adsorption of metal ions, the band gap completely closes as presented in Fig. 7. The DOS plot revealed the significant contribution at the Fermi level from both Li and N p-electrons. In comparison with Fig. 3 b for bare N8 density of states, it follows that the addition of the metal ion leads to an energy down-shift of the sharp peak at the bottom of the conduction band, leading to a metallic behavior. The calculation of the diffusion barrier is an essential characteristic in evaluating the performance and cycling efficiency of the charge/discharge process. Considering the most stable adsorption site for one metal ion per unit cell (shown in Fig. 1) the diffusion mechanism was investigated by calcu- lating the migration path of metal ions from one pore to the nearest neighbor by crossing the N-N bond slightly above it and demonstrated in Fig. 8.

Electronic Stability: Electronic structure calculations showed consistent band gap values, suggesting stability in electronic properties under different environmental conditions. Thermodynamic Viability: Formation energy calculations confirmed that the N8 configuration is energetically favorable compared to competing struc- tures, ensuring its viability as an electrode material. Thermal Resilience: Thermal analysis revealed that the material can with- stand elevated temperatures (up to 500 K) without significant degradation, which makes it suitable for practical applications. This comprehensive stability check indicates that the N8 monolayer excels across all examined dimensions, showcasing its promise for high-performance energy storage systems. Next, we evaluated the quantitative characteristics of the material. Our findings demonstrated that the two-dimensional N8 structure can form sta- ble adsorption complexes with various metal ions, achieving an impressive theoretical specific capacity (TSC) of 1675 mAh/g for sodium (Na) and mag- nesium (Mg) ions. This capacity corresponds to the adsorption of up to seven ions on one side of the monolayer. It highlights the material’s exceptional storage capabilities and versatility in accommodating different metallic ions, making it a strong candidate for enhancing battery performance. Furthermore, the averaged open circuit voltages (OCVs) for the exam- ined metal ions ranged from 2.05 to 3.36 eV, indicating their suitability for cathode applications. Finally, our diffusion barrier calculations revealed a minimal barrier of 1.3 eV for potassium ions (K). This suggests that fur- ther substitutions could be explored to reduce barriers and enhance the N8 monolayer’s performance characteristics. Acknowledgments The work of I.
