Marianetti† Department of Applied Physics and Applied Mathematics, Columbia University, New York, NY 10027 (Dated: July 17, 2020) Predicting the compositional phase stability of strongly correlated electron materials is an out- standing challenge in condensed matter physics, requiring precise computations of total energies. In this work, we employ the density functional theory plus dynamical mean-ﬁeld theory (DFT+DMFT) formalism to address local correlations due to transition metal d electrons on compositional phase stability in the prototype rechargeable battery cathode material LixCoO2, and detailed compar- isons are made with the simpler DFT+U approach (i.e., the Hartree-Fock solution of the DMFT impurity problem). Local interactions are found to strongly impact the energetics of the band insu- lator LiCoO2, most signiﬁcantly via the Eg orbitals, which are partially occupied via hybridization with O p states. We ﬁnd CoO2 and Li1/2CoO2 to be moderately correlated Fermi liquids with quasiparticle weights of 0.6–0.8 for the T2g states, which are most impacted by the interactions. As compared to DFT+U, DFT+DMFT considerably dampens the increase in total energy as U is increased, which indicates that dynamical correlations are important to describe this class of ma- terials despite the relatively modest quasiparticle weights. Unlike DFT+U, which can incorrectly drive LixCoO2 towards spurious phase separating or charge ordered states, DFT+DMFT correctly captures the system’s phase stability and does not exhibit a strong charge ordering tendency. Most importantly, the error within DFT+U varies strongly as the composition changes, challenging the common practice of artiﬁcially tuning U within DFT+U to compensate the errors of Hartree-Fock. DFT+DMFT predicts the average intercalation voltage decreases relative to DFT, opposite to the result of DFT+U, which would yield favorable agreement with experiment in conjunction with the overprediction of the voltage by the strongly constrained and appropriately normed (SCAN) DFT functional.

I. INTRODUCTION Strongly correlated materials, for which density func- tional theory (DFT) calculations often break down due to strong electron-electron interactions, are a challeng- ing class of condensed matter systems relevant to sev- eral important technologies [1, 2]. One example is Li ion rechargeable batteries. These electrochemical cells rely critically on a cathode material that can reversibly in- tercalate Li ions [3]. Since cathode materials typically are based on transition metal oxides to accommodate changes in oxidation state, they have an open d electron shell and are susceptible to strong correlation physics. Currently, the dominant cathode materials are based on LixCoO2 (LCO), a layered compound in which Li ions are intercalated between layers of edge-sharing Co–O oc- tahedra, as shown in Fig. 1(d) [4]. Several early theoret- ical studies that revealed signiﬁcant insight into the elec- tronic structure and phase diagram of LCO [5–8] were based on DFT [9, 10], the de facto standard for ﬁrst- principles calculations in solid-state physics and chem- istry. It is not uncommon, however, for DFT to fail to capture the physics of correlated materials due to the ap- proximation for the exchange-correlation functional [e.g., local density approximation (LDA) or generalized gradi- ent approximation (GGA)]. ∗Present address: Department of Materials Science and Engineer- ing, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL 60208 † chris.marianetti@columbia.edu While DFT calculations in many ways reliably char- acterizes LCO, there are deﬁciencies in their description. DFT (GGA) underestimates the intercalation voltage by around 0.8 V [11]. In addition, using a plane-wave ba- sis set and ultrasoft pseudopotentials, Van der Ven et al. found that LDA overestimates the order-disorder transi- tion temperature for x = 1/2 by 100 ◦C [8]. We note that the LDA linear augmented plane wave results of Wolver- ton and Zunger [7] do not show the same overestimation, though this study uses only roughly one third as many DFT calculations to parameterize the cluster expansion, in addition to performing slightly restricted structural", "page": 0, "position": 1}

We note that the LDA linear augmented plane wave results of Wolver- ton and Zunger [7] do not show the same overestimation, though this study uses only roughly one third as many DFT calculations to parameterize the cluster expansion, in addition to performing slightly restricted structural relaxations. One widely utilized approach to go beyond DFT is the DFT+U method [12], in which an explicit on-site Coulomb interaction U is added to account for the strong interactions in the d shell along with a simple mean-ﬁeld ansatz for the energy functional. However, DFT+U does not fully remedy the shortcomings of DFT and in some cases hurts the description more than it helps. DFT+U still underestimates the voltage by 0.3 V, and it can over- estimate the order-disorder transition temperature by as much as several hundred degrees [13]. DFT+U drives LiCoO2 towards a high-spin transition [14] not observed in experiments [15–17] and, unless spurious charge order- ing is permitted to occur, incorrectly predicts phase sep- aration [13, 18]. Moreover, DFT+U ﬁnds CoO2 to be an insulator in disagreement with experiment [19]. DFT+U clearly is problematic in the context of LCO. Here, we revisit the electronic structure, voltage, and phase stability of LCO using more sophisticated DFT plus dynamical mean-ﬁeld theory (DFT+DMFT) cal- arXiv:1903.10436v2 [cond-mat.str-el] 16 Jul 2020", "page": 0, "position": 2}

In this framework, the many-body DMFT approach captures the dynamical lo- cal correlations of Co d electrons embedded in the crys- tal, whereas only the static eﬀects are described within DFT+U. Total energy DFT+DMFT calculations have become an important tool for understanding structural stability of materials with electronic correlations [21–43], and our work extends this exploration to the realm of compositional phase stability. We ﬁnd that DFT+DMFT describes LiCoO2 as a band insulator with modest shifts and broadenings of the low- energy spectrum, most prominently via the Eg levels par- tially occupied via hybridization with O p states. CoO2 and Li1/2CoO2 are Fermi liquids whose T2g states are most strongly aﬀected by the interactions, with quasi- particle weight of around 0.6–0.7. DFT+DMFT, unlike DFT+U, does not strongly stabilize charge ordering in Li1/2CoO2, nor does it predict insulating behavior for CoO2 or Li1/2CoO2; in other words, DFT+DMFT sub- stantially improves the description of the electronic struc- ture. Dynamical correlations signiﬁcantly dampen the impact of U on the total energy of LCO, but more sub- stantially for CoO2 than LiCoO2, leading to a reduction in voltage as compared to DFT, whereas DFT+U yields the qualitatively opposite behavior. Given the more ac- curate strongly constrained and appropriately normed (SCAN) DFT functional overestimates the experimen- tal voltage, such a decrease in the predicted voltage is expected to lead to agreement between experimental and predicted voltage for DFT+DMFT based on the SCAN functional. Similar to the voltage behavior, the x = 1/2 formation energy prediction is signiﬁcantly aﬀected by dynamical correlations: unlike DFT+U, DFT+DMFT only weakly inﬂuences the formation energy of x = 1/2 as compared to DFT. Our results demonstrate the im- portance of dynamical correlations, missing in DFT+U, to accurately describe the electronic structure and ener- getics of correlated electron materials. II.

Select calculations are also performed us- ing the SCAN functional [51]. Given that LCO exhibits no long range magnetic order in experiment [52], the paramagnetic state is justiﬁed and we do not search for long-range magnetic order. The structures are ﬁxed to the fully relaxed spin-dependent DFT ground state struc- tures with O3 layer stacking [8], corresponding to a band insulator for x = 1 and ferromagnetic low-spin met- als for x = 0 and x = 1/2. Except where otherwise noted, calculations are performed using the ﬁxed non- spin-polarized DFT charge density, i.e., they are non- charge-self-consistent (NCSC); this is done for reasons of computational eﬃciency. We characterize the magni- tude of the error associated with charge self-consistency by directly comparing NCSC and charge-self-consistent (CSC) calculations within DFT+U, demonstrating that the error is suﬃciently small for the trends we are study- ing in this paper.

For comparison, we also perform DFT+U calculations using the projec- tor (corresponding to projection onto spherical harmon- ics within the PAW spheres [56]) correlated subspace in vasp (ldautype=4) and present all our results in terms of the U and J corresponding to this interaction model via U = USK −8JSK/5 and J = 7JSK/5 [57]. Although it has limitations such as lack of normalization [58, 59], we consider the projector correlated subspace since it is widely used. It should be noted that J is ﬁxed in all calculations, even though a range of diﬀerent U is ex- plored. We employ the fully-localized-limit (FLL) form of the double counting [60]. The total energy is converged to within ∼10 meV/f.u. for the DMFT self-consistency condition. III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION A. Electronic structure of CoO2 and LiCoO2 We begin by studying the basic electronic structure of LiCoO2 and CoO2 as a function of U, allowing for a direct comparison between DFT+DMFT and DFT+U. Corresponding results for Li1/2CoO2 are included, but these are not directly discussed until Section III C. In LCO, the ability of the oxygens to relax in the out-of- plane direction slightly distorts the CoO6 octahedra and results in a symmetry lineage of T2g →A1g + E′ g relative to cubic symmetry, though we will still sometimes refer to this manifold as T2g for brevity.

The electronic self-energy Σ on the imaginary (Mat- subara) frequency axis obtained via the CTQMC solver is shown for CoO2 and LiCoO2 in Fig. 2 for density- density interactions. The noise in the self-energy stems from the stochastic nature of the CTQMC solver, and for frequencies above 20 eV there is no noise since we utilize the analytic form of Σ in the high-frequency limit.

We note that the self-energy is well converged, particularly for low frequency. For both CoO2 and LiCoO2, Im(Σ) goes to 0 at low frequency, consistent with well-deﬁned quasiparticles and a band insulator, respectively. This indicates that CoO2 can be described as a Fermi liquid and is not a Mott insulator, consistent with experiments on CoO2 [62–64], whereas past DFT+U studies predict an insulating state [19]; as do our DFT+U results in the present study. Therefore, DFT+DMFT is providing an improved de- scription of the electronic structure of LCO. As a function of U, the magnitude of Im(Σ) increases. The imaginary part of the self-energy is essentially identical for the E′ g and A1g states, which indicates the symmetry breaking within the T2g manifold is small. The overall magnitude of Im(Σ) is moderately larger for CoO2 than for LiCoO2. For CoO2, the imaginary part of the self-energy of the E′ g and A1g states are larger in magnitude than those of the Eg states below iω ≈10 eV, which is reasonable given their respective occupancies. The opposite trend is found for LiCoO2 with a larger magnitude of Im(Σ) for the Eg states for the full range of frequency shown. This suggests that for LiCoO2 the correlations have a larger impact on the nominally-unoccupied Eg states since they are partially occupied via hybridization with O p states, whereas the E′ g and A1g are ﬁlled. For LiCoO2, in the high-frequency limit, Re(Σ) is typ- ically negative for E′ g and A1g and positive for Eg. This indicates that the static part of the correlations tend to push E′ g and A1g down in energy and Eg up in energy as is observed using DFT+U.

This leads to a higher Re(Σ) for E′ g and A1g than Eg towards zero frequency. Overall, the magnitude of the changes in Re(Σ) with U are signiﬁcantly larger for E′ g and A1g than for Eg. For CoO2, the self-energy of the Eg states has a small real part (at most 0.21 eV), which decreases and becomes negative at low frequency. The magnitude is substan- tially larger for E′ g and A1g than Eg with a maximum magnitude of 1.2 eV for U = 5.9 eV. For these states, like in the LiCoO2 case, the values are negative at high frequency (except for very low U) and become positive at low frequency.

From the low-frequency behavior of Im(Σ), we compute the quasiparticle weight Z = [1 −∂Im(Σ)/∂iω|iω→0]−1, shown in Fig. 3. This quantity is unity for U = J = 0 [Im(Σ) = 0] and is inversely proportional to the eﬀective mass arising from electron interactions. All the values decrease with U, as expected, in a roughly linear fashion. Z is always larger for LiCoO2 than CoO2, consistent with the fact that LiCoO2 is a band insulator. This eﬀect is pronounced in the E′ g and A1g states, for which the CoO2 values are 0.14–0.20 lower than those of LiCoO2. For the Eg states, the disparity is smaller, with diﬀerences of only 0.01–0.04. For CoO2, Z is larger and decreases less rapidly for the Eg orbitals compared to the E′ g and A1g orbitals.

Atomic conﬁgurations and d occupancies To further understand the detailed electronic conﬁgu- ration of CoO2 and LiCoO2, in Fig. 4 we plot the prob- abilities of the diﬀerent atomic conﬁgurations sampled by the CTQMC solver in terms of the number of d elec- trons (Nd) and the spin projection Sz. The results for U = 4.9 eV are shown as a representative example. We note that the probability distribution is symmetric about Sz = 0 since our DFT+DMFT calculations are param- agnetic (i.e., there is no long-range magnetic order). Although CoO2 and LiCoO2 are nominally d5 and d6, respectively, the probability distribution is centered at higher values of Nd for both cases due to the appreciable hybridization with O p states. For example, for LiCoO2 there is substantial time in the Monte Carlo simulation in which an electron from an O p state has hopped into an Eg orbital, leading to a d7 state. There are substantial ﬂuctuations in N as well as Sz for the Co site in both systems. For CoO2 the spin ﬂuctuations are moderately larger than in LiCoO2; there is even probability of Sz = 3/2 states. We note that these ﬂuctuations of the Co site highlight why both DFT and DFT+U struggle to capture all the physics in this system. It is also useful to examine the behavior of Nd versus U for all the methodologies employed in this work in Fig. 5. This has been shown to give insight into the behavior and impact of the double counting correction, which is purely a function of Nd [36, 65, 66]. Within DFT, one can observe that Nd is larger for the projector correlated subspace than the Wannier correlated subspace. The dif- ference is moderate for LiCoO2 (0.09),", "page": 3, "position": 1}

These values are much smaller than the nominal value of unity, which is indicative of the strong p–d rehybridization in this system [7, 67]. Nd typically decreases with U. When treating LiCoO2 with DFT+U in the Wannier correlated subspace, we ﬁnd a transition to high-spin Co at U of around 4 eV. Since Co in LiCoO2 is not high-spin in experiments [15– FIG. 4. Probability of Co atomic states with number of d elec- trons Nd and spin projection Sz for (a) CoO2, (b) Li1/2CoO2, and (c) LiCoO2. 17], we only consider the low-spin Co state to facilitate comparison with DFT+DMFT, for which we do not ﬁnd this spurious high-spin state. For LiCoO2 in the Wannier correlated subspace (the band insulator state), the de- crease in Nd with U for DFT+U is around 0.25 electrons. The inclusion of dynamical correlations (DFT+DMFT) substantially dampens this decrease to a only 0.06 elec- trons. Unlike in the Wannier case, for DFT+U in the projector correlated subspace, the decrease in Nd is small in magnitude (around 0.03 electrons) and including charge self-consistency leads to even smaller changes on the order of 0.006 electrons.", "page": 4, "position": 0}

Here, DFT+DMFT gives a small decrease in Nd of 0.04 electrons, whereas the decrease is much more substantial (0.3 electrons) for DFT+U in the Wannier correlated subspace, which de- scribes CoO2 as an insulator except for the smallest U considered. For DFT+U in the projector case, in which there is a discontinuous decrease in Nd corresponding to a metal-insulator transition, charge self-consistency damp- ens the change in Nd from around 0.1 to 0.02 electrons. The behavior of Nd versus U can further be under- stood by decomposing Nd into the components from the T2g (E′ g and A1g) and Eg orbitals, as shown in Fig. 6. We do not show the individual E′ g and A1g occupancies for brevity, but they are included in the Supplemental Mate- rial [68]. Within DFT, the Wannier correlated subspace leads to higher (lower) occupancy of T2g (Eg) by 0.13– 0.23 (0.32–0.39) electrons compared to the projector case. In DFT+U, the LiCoO2 T2g occupancy increases with U, whereas the Eg occupancy decreases more rapidly; this leads to the overall decrease in Nd. For the Wannier case, the T2g occupancy increases more rapidly with U at lower U compared to the projector case; for larger U, the occu- pancy begins to saturate close to the nominal value of 6.

Including charge self-consistency has a very small eﬀect on the occupancies of LiCoO2 in the projector case. The trends in the occupancies are the same for DFT+DMFT as in DFT+U, but the magnitude of the changes in oc- cupancy are much smaller. Within DFT+U, the CoO2 T2g occupancy is relatively constant with U in the Wannier correlated subspace, whereas the Eg occupancy decreases by 0.22 electrons. The CoO2 T2g occupancy also does not change very much with U in the projector case, though there is a discontinu- ity leading to a decrease in occupancy through the metal- insulator transition. In this case, charge self-consistency serves to slightly enhance the T2g and Eg occupancies. As in the case of LiCoO2, the changes in occupancy within DFT+DMFT are smaller than those of DFT+U with both T2g and Eg occupancies slightly decreasing by 0.003 and 0.04, respectively, over the range of U. We note that the DFT+DMFT occupancies are fairly similar to those of DFT for both CoO2 and LiCoO2. C. Electronic structure of Li1/2CoO2 Here, we discuss the electronic structure of Li1/2CoO2, which warrants extra attention due to the issue of spu- rious charge ordering which occurs in DFT+U but is not seen experimentally [69]. This known structure has an in-plane ordering of Li corresponding to a primitive unit cell with two formula units [7, 8, 70]. We perform DFT+DMFT calculations in two diﬀerent ways. First, we enforce the symmetry between the two structurally- equivalent Co sites, i.e., only a single impurity problem is solved. However, the aforementioned approach does not allow for charge ordering to spontaneously break point symmetry. Therefore, we also use a", "page": 5, "position": 1}

However, the aforementioned approach does not allow for charge ordering to spontaneously break point symmetry. Therefore, we also use a second approach where two impurity calculations are employed (i.e., one for each Co atom in the unit cell), and we only exe- cute this at U = 3.9 eV due to computational expense. Using the second approach, we do ﬁnd a stable charge- ordered state, with a diﬀerence in Nd on the two sites of 0.4 electrons, but it is slightly higher in energy than the non-charge-ordered state (by 3 meV/f.u.). Although this is a quite small energy diﬀerence, it it clear that DFT+DMFT removes the strong tendency for spurious charge ordering that is produced by DFT+U, and we proceed with our analysis of the symmetric solution. Within DFT, Li1/2CoO2 is metallic with half a hole in the T2g manifold, as can be seen from the density of states in Fig. 1(b). For DFT+U in the Wannier correlated subspace, like in the LiCoO2 case (discussed above), we ignore states containing high-spin Co found at large U; instead, we consider the low-spin ground state, a charge- ordered insulator (see Figs. 5(b), 6(b), and 6(e)).

The DFT+DMFT self-energy in Fig. 2 illustrates that Li1/2CoO2 is, like CoO2, a Fermi liquid with correlations most signiﬁcantly aﬀecting the T2g manifold. We ﬁnd a Fermi liquid up to the highest U value considered, in agreement with the metallic behavior observed in experi- ment [52, 71, 72]. The T2g quasiparticle weights, in Fig. 3 are signiﬁcantly lower than those of LiCoO2 and slightly larger than those of CoO2. This reﬂects that the elec- tronic structure of Li1/2CoO2 is closer to that of CoO2 than LiCoO2. As for the endmembers (x = 0 and x = 1), for Li1/2CoO2, Nd (Fig. 5) is larger in the projector cor- related subspace. Within DFT+DMFT, Nd decreases very mildly with U similar to the endmember behavior. Here, dynamical correlations only slightly reduce Nd (on the order of 0.02 electrons). Within NCSC DFT+U, the magnitude of the charge ordering is substantial (as much as ∼0.8 electrons) in the Wannier correlated subspace.

Total energy of LiCoO2 and CoO2 Having documented the basic electronic structure, we proceed to explore the total energy of LiCoO2 and CoO2 as a function of U, allowing for a direct comparison be- tween DFT+DMFT and DFT+U. The total energy of LCO is shown as a function of U for several methodolo- gies in Fig. 7. The two vertical dashed lines indicate the values of U for CoO2 and LiCoO2 as computed from ﬁrst principles via linear response [73]. The total ener- gies increase with U, as expected. We note that extrap- olating any of the results to U = 0 does not approach the DFT result (large purple diamond), which is simply due to the fact that we used a ﬁxed value of J for all calculations. The magnitude of the increase in total en- ergy with U is generally greater for CoO2 than LiCoO2, which makes sense since the impact of the on-site inter- action is expected to be larger for the system for which T2g is partially ﬁlled (nominally). For NCSC DFT+U in the Wannier correlated subspace, for example, over the full range of U shown the increase in energy of CoO2 is 2.4 eV as compared to only 1.8 eV for LiCoO2. For the same set of calculations using the projector correlated subspace, we ﬁnd the same trend with energy increases of roughly 2.7 eV for CoO2 and 2.3 eV for LiCoO2. We note that the individual total energies from methods uti- lizing these diﬀerent correlated subspaces (projector and Wannier) are not directly comparable, but the behavior of the total energy", "page": 6, "position": 1}

Here, for LiCoO2, we ﬁnd only very small diﬀerences (at most 9 meV/f.u.) between the NCSC and CSC total energies. For CoO2, the situation is similar with diﬀerences in to- tal energy of at most 20 meV/f.u.. The small impact of changes in charge density on the total energies suggest the ﬁxed charge density should be a reasonable approx- imation for DFT+DMFT. More importantly, we have a clear guideline on the magnitude of the eﬀect for charge self-consistency within DFT+U, and we expect this is an upper bound for DFT+DMFT calculations in which the impact will likely be dampened. Within DFT+DMFT, we ﬁnd very little impact of in- cluding the oﬀ-diagonal J interaction terms within the Eg manifold in addition to the density-density interac- tions. The magnitude of the diﬀerences is typically only around 5–15 meV/f.u. for LiCoO2 and 3–9 meV/f.u. for CoO2. This suggests that density-density interactions are likely suﬃcient to describe this class of systems. In all of the following results, we ﬁnd no signiﬁcant dif- ference in employing these two interaction forms. The DFT+DMFT results, which employ the Wannier corre- lated subspace, appear to merge with the corresponding DFT+U results in the limit of small U, as should be the case. We note again that in this limit, neither the DFT+U nor the DFT+DMFT results recover the DFT values (large purple diamonds in Fig. 7) simply because we take have taken a ﬁxed ﬁnite J value, whereas the DFT values correspond to J = 0.

We ﬁnd the general impact of dynamical correlations on the energetics is to dampen the magnitude of the in- crease in total energy with U as compared to the static Hartree-Fock treatment in DFT+U. When U is in- creased from 1.9 to 5.9 eV, the total energy of LiCoO2 increases by 1.8 eV within DFT+U as opposed to only 1.3 eV within DFT+DMFT. For CoO2, the magnitude of these energies is substantially larger with an increase of 2.4 eV for DFT+U and 1.6 eV for DFT+DMFT. By this measure, dynamical correlations decrease the energy penalty of U by 26% for LiCoO2 and 33% for CoO2. Therefore, dynamical correlations have a larger impact on CoO2 than LiCoO2. This corresponds to very large absolute diﬀerences in the energies predicted by DFT+U and DFT+DMFT. For CoO2, for example, around the linear response values of U the diﬀerence in energy is around 1 eV. This strongly suggests dynamical correla- tions, missing in the DFT+U approach, are important for accurate total energies. It should be emphasized that the diﬀerence between DFT+DMFT and DFT+U changes substantially as a function of x, and this error will therefore strongly af- fect observables. One strategy to correct errors within DFT+U calculations is to tune U to artiﬁcially low val- ues, and this can be successful if U is ﬁrst calibrated to some experimental observable. However, our work indi- cates that the errors vary strongly with composition, and therefore DFT+U studies of compositional phase stabil- ity would need to tune U as a function of doping, a far", "page": 7, "position": 1}

Below we explore the average battery voltage, where the composition dependent errors within DFT+U have severe consequences. E. Average intercalation voltage We turn our attention to the average intercalation volt- age of LCO for 0 ≤x ≤1, plotted in Fig. 8, which is a key observable for a rechargeable battery cathode. The average intercalation voltage V is computed via eV = E(Li) + E(CoO2) −E(LiCoO2), where e is the elementary charge and body-centered-cubic Li is the ref- erence electrode [6]. As has been known, DFT tends to underpredict the experimental voltage [6], in this case by around 0.7 V. The predicted voltage increases with DFT+U. In the projector correlated subspace, the value comes close to reasonable agreement with the experi- mental value (approximately 4.26 V [74]) for the largest U considered, and charge self-consistency has a negli- gible eﬀect. The voltage also becomes larger than the DFT value for DFT+U in the Wannier case, though the predicted values are appreciably smaller and do not reach agreement with experiment. In stark contrast, within DFT+DMFT, the predicted intercalation voltage is smaller than the DFT value up to the highest computed value of U = 6 eV. As compared to DFT+U, the voltage at ﬁxed J increases much more slowly as a function of U. This mainly stems from the dampened increase in energy for CoO2. For the computed values of U, the predicted voltage is only 3.39–3.45 V, a moderate amount less than that of pure DFT. The increase in V within DFT+U and general agree- ment with experiment was shown previously [73] and seemed to suggest that DFT+U is reliable for this class of materials. However, this viewpoint should be carefully scrutinized given that DFT+U is a rather crude theory, in that DFT+U is obtained from DFT+DMFT when the quantum impurity problem is solved within static mean- ﬁeld theory, neglecting dynamical correlations. There- fore, DFT+DMFT is superior in every respect.

Given that DFT+DMFT actually worsens the pre- dicted voltage as compared to DFT, we are left with the puzzling question as to why. We explore several possibil- ities. First and foremost, while DMFT should improve DFT with respect to local physics, it is possible that there are still substantial nonlocal errors within the den- sity functional employed in the DFT+DMFT functional.

As expected, increasing U within DFT(SCAN)+U causes the voltage to further increase, moving away from the experimen- tal value. We do not compute the DFT(SCAN)+DMFT results due to the computational cost, but we antic- ipate that they should have the same U-dependence as DFT(PBE)+DMFT, just as DFT(SCAN)+U and DFT(PBE)+U have a very similar U-dependence. If so, the DFT(SCAN)+DMFT voltage should be mildly de- creased compared to the DFT(SCAN) voltage, yielding reasonable agreement with experiment. Alternatively, DFT(SCAN)+U only worsens the voltage prediction, and this suggests the reason why DFT(PBE)+U per- forms well is due to the cancellations of two large and distinct errors.

Allowing for small U diﬀerences in the endmembers will result in small changes in the voltage. Similiar arguments might be made for other un- certainties in the methodology, such as the double count- ing correction, etc. We do not attempt to build a case for the most correct set of parameters in this work. It is worth noting that one early explanation for discrepan- cies in the DFT predicted voltages was the overestimated magnitude of the cohesive energy of body-centered-cubic Li within LDA [6]. However, we ﬁnd the cohesive en- ergy predicted by PBE (−1.60 eV) and SCAN (−1.59 eV) are in good agreement with experiment (−1.63 eV [77]). Therefore, the discrepancy between theory and ex- periment should stem from the energetics of the cathode material itself. F. Phase stability of Li1/2CoO2 As another test of the computed DFT+DMFT total energy, we compute the phase stability of Li1/2CoO2. The formation energy ∆E, computed as E(Li1/2CoO2)− 1 2[E(CoO2) + E(LiCoO2)], is shown in Fig. 9. We use the diﬀerence in average experimental voltage values for 0 < x < 1/2 (V−) and 1/2 < x < 1 (V+) to esti- mate the experimental formation energy for x = 1/2, via ∆E = x(1−x)(eV+−eV−) [78]. Using the data of Ref. 74, we compute ∆E of −114 meV/f.u. for Li1/2CoO2. As the formation energy has a signiﬁcantly smaller scale than the voltage, it is more sensitive to the diﬀerent method- ologies employed in this work. Furthermore, the energet- ics of NCSC calculations will be less reliable when there is a substantial rearrangement of charge. We ﬁnd a DFT value of −218 meV/f.u. NCSC DFT+U in the projector correlated subspace signiﬁ- cantly decreases the magnitude of the formation en- ergy and nearly reaches agreement with experiment at large U.

Charge self-consistency tends to destabilize Li1/2CoO2 compared to the endmembers, further low- ering the formation energy magnitude to values much smaller than experiment. While the formation energy remains negative (in agreement with the experimentally- known phase stability), we have shown previously that the more common DFT+U methodology based on spin- dependent DFT incorrectly predicts phase separation of Li1/2CoO2 in the absence of charge ordering [13]. The formation energy is also signiﬁcantly aﬀected by U using DFT+U in the Wannier correlated subspace, but in the opposite direction. In this case, the formation energy is pushed more negative to values of 260–270 meV/f.u. Given that DFT+DMFT prefers not to charge order, the errors associated with NCSC are expected to be com- parable to those estimated for the endmembers, which would still be small on this scale. DFT+DMFT shows only a small increase in formation energy with U, on the order of tens of meV/f.u. The predicted value in the range of computed U is similar to that of DFT. The DFT+DMFT error may also be associated in part with the DFT exchange-correlation functional. We also plot the formation energy using the SCAN functional, which is approximately 50 meV/f.u. higher than the PBE value. Therefore, we would anticipate the DFT(SCAN)+DMFT results to be shifted by roughly the same amount, which would be much closer to the experimental range. In sum- mary, similar to the voltage behavior, our results suggest that dynamical correlations signiﬁcantly impact the pre- dicted formation energy and that DFT+DMFT based on SCAN will lead to improved agreement with experiment. −300 −250 −200 −150 −100 −50 0 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 Formation Energy (meV/f.u.)

CONCLUSIONS We investigate the electronic structure, intercalation voltage, and phase stability of LCO with the many-body DFT+DMFT methodology and compare to DFT and DFT+U. In DFT+DMFT, LiCoO2 is a band insula- tor, while we ﬁnd that CoO2 and Li1/2CoO2 are moder- ately correlated Fermi liquids, without a strong tendency for charge ordering in Li1/2CoO2, in agreement with ex- periments. Dynamical correlations (missing in DFT+U) substantially impact the energetics of LCO by dampening the changes in total energy and Nd found via the DFT+U approach, especially for CoO2 and Li1/2CoO2. The inter- calation voltage behavior of DFT+U and DFT+DMFT are qualitatively diﬀerent, with the latter decreasing the voltage with respect to DFT; the phase stability of Li1/2CoO2 within DFT+DMFT also diﬀers starkly from DFT+U.

Our results suggest that the Hartree-Fock treatment of the impurity problem in DFT+U is insuﬃcient to accurately describe the elec- tronic structure and thermodynamics of correlated elec- tron materials. In addition, due to the strong composi- tion dependence of the impact of dynamical correlations, our results challenge the common practice of artiﬁcially tuning U within DFT+U to compensate for the errors of Hartree-Fock. Given the signiﬁcant computational ex- pense of solving the impurity problem in DFT+DMFT, the development of less computationally expensive but still suﬃciently accurate impurity solvers will be impor- tant future work to enable the study of compositional phase stability of strongly correlated electron materials.
