Uncertainty quantiﬁcation for these phase diagram predictions enables a quantitative metric of conﬁdence for guiding design in computational materials engineering. In this work, an assessment of the CALPHAD method trained on only density functional theory (DFT) data is performed for the Li-Si binary system as a case study. with applications to the modeling of Si as an anode for Li-ion batteries. Using a parameter sampling approach based on the Bayesian Error Estimation Functional (BEEF-vdW) exchange-correlation. By using built-in ensemble of functionals from BEEF-vdW, the uncertainties of the Gibbs Free Energy ﬁtting parameters are obtained and can be propagated to the resulting phase diagram. To ﬁnd the best ﬁtting form of the CALPHAD model, we implement a model selection step using the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) applied to a speciﬁc phase and speciﬁc temperature range. Applying the best selected CALPHAD model from the DFT calculation, to other sampled BEEF functionals, an ensemble of CALPHAD models is generated leading to an ensemble of phase diagram predictions. The resulting phase diagrams are then compiled into a single-phase diagram representing the most probable phase predicted as well as a quantitative metric of conﬁdence for the prediction. This treatment of uncertainty resulting from DFT provides a rigorous way to ensure the correlated errors of DFT is accounted for in the estimation of uncertainty.

We ﬁnd that each method of propagating the uncertainty can lead to diﬀerent phases being identiﬁed as stable on the phase diagram. For example, the phase Li4.11Si at 300K is predicted to be stable by all functionals using the second and third method, but only 15% of functionals predict it to be stable using the ﬁrst method. From the phase diagram, we have also determined intercalation voltages for lithiated silicon. We see that the same phase can have a distribution of predicted voltages depending on the functional. In combination, we can generate a better understanding of the phase transitions and voltage proﬁle to make a more analysis-informed prediction for experiments and the performance of Si-anodes within batteries. INTRODUCTION The prediction of phase diagrams and phase transfor- mations are important for many energy applications, es- pecially in Li-ion batteries.1 Computational prediction of equilibrium phase diagrams using density functional theory has been used successfully to predict the ther- modynamics of intercalation electrodes.1,2 However, the prediction of equilibrium phase diagrams involves vari- ous sources of uncertainty: uncertainty associated with numerical predictions of density functional theory, choice of the exchange correlation functional,3 uncertainty as- sociated with the choice of a model for describing the thermodynamics of the system such as cluster expansion4 and uncertainty associated with ﬁtting the parameters of the chosen model.5 Quantifying the uncertainty is important as this could lead to vastly diﬀerent conclusions on the identiﬁed sta- ble phases and the associated thermodynamics.6 The challenge associated with systematic uncertainty quan- tiﬁcation and propagation through a model has lim- ited the application of these methods to calculation of phase diagrams (CALPHAD).

Using this in conjunction with a Monte-Carlo sampling scheme determined the posterior probability distribution. In a recent work, Honarmandi et al. performed a thor- ough evaluation of uncertainty of CALPHAD model pa- rameters and the resulting phase diagrams of Hf-Si bi- nary system.9 A large source of uncertainty within these predictions stems from the choice of the exchange correla- tion functional for DFT calculated data.3,10–12 Bayesian error estimation capabilities of the BEEF-vdW exchange correlation function has been used to quantify uncer- tainty associated with a variety of DFT-predicted ma- terial properties.13–16 In this work, we implement model-parameter selection through the use of Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) arXiv:2003.13393v1 [cond-mat.mtrl-sci] 23 Feb 2020", "page": 0, "position": 2}

Within this work, we use the ensemble of func- tionals from BEEF as a sampler for the generation of CALPHAD models in order to propagate the uncertainty from DFT to the ﬁnal prediction of phase diagrams. We assume that every phase diagram of diﬀerent function- als from BEEF can provide potentially useful informa- tion as it samples the predictions of a point in exchange- correlation space. The BIC model selection method is applied for each chosen solid phase in our Li-Si binary system and a speciﬁc temperature range of 200K-450K. We implement a Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) model selection step to determine best model from a 10-parameter CALPHAD model space.

The inset picture shows the results of RMSE corresponding to diﬀerent models. METHODS To compute the energy of each structure, the Projector Augmented Wave method of Density functional theory, as implemented in GPAW36, was used. The exchange correlation potential was treated at the genearalized gra- dient approximation level using he Bayesian Error Es- timation Functional with van der Waals (BEEF-vdW)3. For each structure, the atomic positions were ﬁrst relaxed to a maximum force of 0.03 eV/˚A, and the computed en- ergy at various volumes was ﬁt to a vinet equation of state37 using either 7 or 9 diﬀerent volumes depending on the diﬃculty of ﬁtting the equation of state for the ensemble of functionals. Using the ﬁtted properties of the equation of state, a Debye-Grunessen theory analysis38 was used to incorpo- rate vibrational properties and predict the Gibbs free en- ergy as a function of temperature as the Debye model is a reasonable approximation that yields ﬁnite temperature thermodynamics of suﬃcient accuracy16. This process was repeated for the ensemble of 2000 non-self consistent exchange-correlation functionals within the BEEF-vdW model space framework, but not every functional can lead to successful result (see computational details of Suppli- mentary Information). Next, to best ﬁt the predicted Gibbs energy curve for each phase, we employ model selection through the use of BIC. The BIC was chosen as it tends to penalize com- plex models more heavily, giving preference to simpler models in selection than the Akaike information crite- rion (AIC)39 especially for a small number of training points. The Gibbs energy of the pure element i in phase Φ, namely the Gibbs energy function used within CAL- PHAD modeling, is adopted in this work as the following equation40: G0,Φ i (T) = GΦ i (T) −HSER i = a + bT + cTlnT + dT 2 + eT −1 + fT 3 + gT 7 + hT −9 + iT 4 + jlnT (1) In this equation, the Gibbs energies of the pure solid (Li)-bcc, (Si)-diamond and all stoichiometric compounds are described with", "page": 2, "position": 0}

In previous work incorporat- ing uncertainty within phase diagram predictions, as discussed above, Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling approach has conventionally been used to ob- tain plausible optimum values and uncertainties of the parameters9,45. This propagation of uncertainty assumes that the errors in the prediction of two materials from DFT are independent of one another. It is well known, however, that the errors of DFT predictions contain correlated, systematic prediction errors. Thus, within this work, we utilize BEEF as a sampler of GGA-level exchange-correlation potential space to understand the correlated uncertainty of the underlying ab initio thermo- dynamics data and its eﬀect on the ﬁnal prediction.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION A sample BIC model selection for Li15Si4 within the 10-parameter model space for the temperature range 200K-450K is shown in Figure 1, with the BIC model selection of all other materials available in the Supple- mentary Information. In this case, the lowest value of the BIC corresponds to a 6 parameters model, while for other materials the number of parameters varied from 5 to 7 as can be seen in Table II along with the speciﬁc model chosen. Although the number of parameters chosen is consistent with the number commonly used in the liter- ature about CALPHAD, diﬀerent phases have diﬀerent speciﬁc combinations of parameters rather than a ﬁxed set of parameters as is conventionally used.

However, in the uncertainty phase diagram, we consider all of the diﬀerent prediction re- sults from the BEEF ensemble so that we can predict the occurrence probability of one phase point. At one phase with increasing temperature, if c-value also increases, the phase is stable at high temperatures, otherwise, the phase is stable at low temperatures. For example, we can say that solid Li is stable at low temperatures and Li12Si7 is very unlikely to be stable according to the c-value of the UQ phase diagram. In the previous uncertainty phase di- agram found in literature,9,45 only the uncertainty range of a speciﬁc phase is given. Therefore, in this uncertainty phase diagram, it can not only give the uncertainty range but also give the occurrence probability compared with the uncertainty phase diagrams in P. Honarmandi et al’s work9. Hence, this kind of uncertainty phase diagram can help determine a better phase prediction and under- stand the process of phase transition of a system better. When we consider the composition of mixing phases or the correlation between two adjacent predicted sta- ble phases even all predicted stable phases, the former method is not enough, especially when trying to predict the exact phase mixture at compositions that are not a distinct phase. To do this, we utilize two additional methods that consider the occurrence of pairs together, as well as the occurrence of a the full set of phases on a hull. For the pairs of phases case in Li-Si system, sim- ilarly, we deﬁne the c-value as the normalized number of times a functional predicts a pair of phases to occur at a given temperature.

We can see when temperature is below 300K, phase with x in range between 0 and 0.196 will be pre- dicted as the mixing of solid Li phase and solid Li4.11Si phase with the maximum probability 0.75. With temper- ature increasing, this prediction will not change but the maximum c-value will decrease, whose physical meaning is that the solid Li phase may disappear because of the melting point. As for a phase with x in the range be- tween 0.196 and 1.0, it is predicted to be the mixing of solid Li4.11Si phase and solid Si phase with the maximum c-value 0.6 or a bit higher during the temperature range from 200 to 450K. For the case of comparing ﬁnal predicted convex hulls in Li-Si system, we deﬁne the c-value as the normalized number of times a functional predicts a speciﬁc convex hull of phases to occur at a given temperature. That is the number of appearance times of a convex hull of FIG. 6. Voltage prediction for the Si-anode system. At each x in LixSi, we show the probability density function as a countour and the optimal BEEF prediction as a solidblue line represents.

The green and pink lines are from the experimen- tal measurements of T.D. Hatchard et al. and M.N. Obrovac et al.48,49 phases in the ensemble of phase diagrams divided by the number of functionals of an ensemble. Though there are 13 phases in Li-Si system, there are just 27 kinds of valid convex hulls predicted by the functionals of the ensemble, after removing convex hulls with a small probability(less than 0.05), there are just 6 kinds of the valid convex hull to be considered. Among them, there are just 2 convex hulls shown with max probability when x in range 0 to 1 and T in range 200 to 450K. The speciﬁc c-value of each convex hull of phases for each temperature is shown in Figure 5(a). Figure 5(b) shows the corresponding phase diagram. The crossing points of each horizontal T line and blue lines represent the predicted stable phases be- long to the convex hull appearing with maximum proba- bility at that temperature. For the phases between blue lines, the deeper the color, the bigger the c-value. We can see when the temperature is below 400K, the convex hull including stable solid phase Li, solid Li4.11Si, and solid Si will be predicted appearing with the maximum c-value. Speciﬁcally, this prediction stays as 0.58 when T is be- low 300K, but with temperature increasing, the c-value will decrease, as the solid Li phase is predicted to disap- pear because of melting. When T increases from 400K to 450K, the convex hull including stable solid phase Li4.11Si and solid Si will be predicted appearing with the maxi- mum c-value but the value decreases. As for phase with x in range between 0.196 and 1.0, it is predicted to be the mixing of solid Li4.11Si phase and solid Si phase with equal c-value of the convex hull it belongs to.

In order to visualize these various predictions, the results at each composition were binned into a histogram with 0.066 V bin width. This then generates a probability distribu- tion function at every composition with is then plotted as the contour map in Figure 6. From this ﬁgure, we see the maximum intercalation potential predicted with maximum probability varies slightly from the the BEEF optimal but give the range that includes the experimental data well. We can see here, diﬀerent functionals can not only predict diﬀerent phase transition but also predict diﬀerent energy diﬀerence, both of them will inﬂuence the prediction of voltage. The same phase transition (namely the same pair of phases) may have huge voltage predic- tion diﬀerence because of the huge diﬀerence of energy diﬀerence between two phases from diﬀerent functionals. And diﬀerent phase transition (namely diﬀerent pairs of phases) may have very close voltage prediction. If we just consider the c-value of phase, we may get better phases transition prediction; if we just consider the probability density of voltage, we may get better voltage proﬁle pre- diction. By using both in combination, we can have a better understanding of the phase transitions and volt- age proﬁle to make a better prediction for experiments and the performance of the Li-Si system within batteries. CONCLUSION In this work, we employed model selection using the BIC to determine the best model from a list of inde- pendently generated models for a speciﬁc phase and spe- ciﬁc temperature range using DFT-data and the Debye- Grunessen model. A sampling of GGA-space within the DFT data is carried out using the built-in error estima- tion capabilities of the BEEF-vdW exchange correlation function. Using this, we determine the uncertainty asso- ciated with Li-Si binary system, an important candidate Li-ion battery anode. We carry out three diﬀerent ap- proaches to uncertainty quantiﬁcation for the Li-Si phase diagram. These three methods include various levels of statistical correlation between the prediction of phases.

We believe that quantifying the un- certainty will provide a more detailed assessment of the possible phase diagram and one particular use is to iden- tify the regions of largest uncertainty to guide the most useful experiment to be done for the most information gain related to the phase diagram.

COMPUTATIONAL DETAILS First, we use Quantum Espresso (QE) to relax cells of Li-Si system. Since the product of the number of k points and the lattice parameter (angstrom) in each dimension should be larger than a certain threshold, which depends on the system. Usually, for insulator or semiconductor, it can be as low as 20; for metal, it should be larger than 30. According this, we choose k-points for Li, Si, Li15Si4, Li22Si5, Li21Si5, Li13Si4, LiSi, Li7Si2, Li12Si7, Li17Si4, Li4.11Si, Li7Si3 as (9 9 9), (4 4 4), (3 3 3), (2 2 2), (2 2 2), (3 2 6), (3 3 5), (3 2 6), (4 2 2), (2 2 2), (6 1 2), (4 4 2). The etot conv thr is 1.0E-4, the forc conv thr is 1.0E-3. The ecutwfc is 78.3, the ecutrho is 355. We also use Li.pbe-s-kjpaw psl.0.2.1.UPF and Si.pbe-n- kjpaw psl.0.1.UPF from database http://www.quantum-espresso.org/pseudopotentials. In this work, we ﬁnished the calculation without the use of Hubbard U. All density functional calculations were performed using the Projector Augmented Wave- function as implement in real space within the GPAW software with a grid spacing of 0.16 ˚A, the K-points for per cell is the same with the value we take in QE calculation. Using the ﬁtted properties of the equation of state, a Debye-Grunessen theory analysis1 was used to incorporate vibrational properties and predict the Gibbs free energy as a function of temperature. This process was repeated for the ensemble of 2000 non-self consistent exchange-correlation functionals within the BEEF-vdW model space framework. But not all of the 2000 functionals provided suﬃcient energy-volume data to ﬁt an equation of state, only 1385 out of 2000 functionals are successful. 2", "page": 10, "position": 0}
