Nonetheless, the microscopic mechanisms of Li-ion transport in Li3PS4 are far to be fully understood, the role of PS4 dynamics in charge transport still being controversial. In this work, we build machine learning potentials targeting state-of-the-art DFT references (PBEsol, r2SCAN, and PBE0) to tackle this problem in all known phases of Li3PS4 (α, β and γ), for large system sizes and timescales. We discuss the physical origin of the observed superionic behavior of Li3PS4: the activation of PS4 flipping drives a structural transition to a highly conductive phase, characterized by an increase of Li-site availability and by a drastic reduction in the activation energy of Li-ion diffusion. We also rule out any paddle-wheel effects of PS4 tetrahedra in the superionic phases–previously claimed to enhance Li-ion diffusion–due to the orders-of-magnitude difference between the rate of PS4 flips and Li-ion hops at all temperatures below melting. We finally elucidate the role of inter-ionic dynamical correlations in charge transport, by highlighting the failure of the Nernst-Einstein approximation to estimate the electrical conductivity. Our results show a strong dependence on the target DFT reference, with PBE0 yielding the best quantitative agreement with experimental measurements not only for the electronic band-gap but also for the electrical conductivity of β- and α-Li3PS4. I. INTRODUCTION The growing demand for portable electronic products and electric vehicles has stimulated the creation of en- ergy storage systems that offers better safety and higher energy density than current Li-ion battery systems[1].

While commercial Li-ion batteries use organic liquid elec- trolytes and additives to achieve a high working volt- age [2, 3], these materials pose safety concerns due to their flammability and susceptibility to thermal runaway [4, 5]. To address these issues, researchers are develop- ing all-solid-state batteries (ASSBs) with inorganic solid electrolytes (SEs) to provide a sustainable solution for energy storage, exploiting their expected longer lifespan and improved energy efficiency [6, 7]. Many families of SEs have been considered and studied during these years [8–10]. Sulfides are recognised as uniquely promising ma- terials due to their remarkable mechanical stability and room-temperature ionic conductivity [11–16]. In partic- ular, the family of lithium thiophosphates (LPS), with its archetypal Li3PS4 compound, is widely recognised as one of the most promising family of sulfide electrolytes and it has been the subject of many experimental and computational studies [1, 17–27]. Li3PS4 has three main polymorphs: α-Li3PS4 (with space group Cmcm [28]), β-Li3PS4 (Pnma) and γ- Li3PS4 (Pmn21). Whereas the γ polymorph is the most stable at room temperature, it also exhibits low room- temperature ionic conductivity (≈3 × 10−7 S cm−1 [20]). The system transforms into the metastable β- † These authors equally contributed to this work ∗michele.ceriotti@epfl.ch polymorph at 573 K and then into the α-polymorph at 746 K [20]. Despite their great relevance, in the past years computational studies have been limited by the use of empirical potentials [23, 24] and ab-initio molec- ular dynamics (AIMD) [22], based on density functional theory (DFT) with generalised gradient approximation (GGA) [29, 30]. The former can provide useful mech- anistic insights, but fail to correctly predict the activa- tion energies of the conductive phases [23] and are inher- ently limited in their accuracy and transferability. Quan- tum mechanical approaches, on the other hand, are more accurate but they are burdened by a higher computa- tional cost, which hinders their applicability to realistic systems.

Quan- tum mechanical approaches, on the other hand, are more accurate but they are burdened by a higher computa- tional cost, which hinders their applicability to realistic systems. For example, recent studies based on AIMD- PBE simulations attributed the superionic conductivity of glassy 75 Li2S–25 P2S5 and that of bulk β-Li3PS4 to the presence of fast cation-polyanion correlations – the so-called paddlewheel effect [31, 32]. While providing ev- idence of this effect, the simulations carried out in these works are clearly limited in the simulation times and sys- tem sizes they can achieve, potentially leading to unphys- ical outcomes. In the last decade, the advent of machine learning has allowed the construction of interatomic potentials possessing quantum mechanical accuracy at a cost that is only marginally higher than that of classical force fields [33–45]. Machine learning potentials (MLP) rely on the construction of physically-motivated representa- tions to predict a given target property. In particular, representations of atomic configurations should preserve key physical symmetries: global translational and rota- tional invariance, as well as invariance with respect to the permutation of atoms of the same chemical species [46].

Sketch of the α, β and γ phases of Li3PS4, showing the difference of the relative alignment of the PS4 tetrahedra along reference (010) crystallographic planes (here numbered between 1 and 6 for clarity). The γ structure has all tetrahedra aligned along the [100] direction for all this set of planes, while the β structure has the tetrahedra aligned along both the [100] direction and the [¯100] across each plane. Finally, the α phase has a staggered ordering: the tetrahedra are aligned along [100]/[¯100] for the planes that are numbered with even/odd numbers. Smooth Overlap of Atomic Positions (SOAP) [47] used in combination with appropriate regression schemes has facilitated the development of ML potentials for simulat- ing a variety of materials properties via extensive finite- temperature thermodynamic sampling [25, 26, 48–58] Notable examples of the use of MLPs to study the ionic conductivity in solid-state electrolytes are the Gaussian Approximation Potential (GAP) for lithium thiophos- phate developed by Staacke et al. [26] and the Deep Neu- ral Network (DNN) for Li10GeP2S12-type compounds de- veloped by Huang and coworkers [59]. Both these studies were able to characterize the diffusion properties of their respective target compounds, and overcome some known limitations of AIMD, namely the small size and the short simulation times that are accessible by this type of mod- elling. Despite these important breakthroughs, two main aspects are still missing to provide a comprehensive study of transport properties in this class of materials. First, the accuracy of the aforementioned potentials is limited to the GGA level of theory, due to the choice of the ref- erence DFT functional (PBE and PBEsol) for the cal- culation of the training set structures. While this is a standard choice for performing first-principles calcu- lations in solids, the relatively small number of refer- ence single-point calculations (usually a few thousands) that are needed to reach the desired target ML accuracy enables the use of more accurate references, like meta- GGA and hybrid functionals [60, 61].

To our knowledge, no systematic study comparing different DFT references exists up to date for this class of materials. Secondly, these studies neglect the contribution of inter-ionic cor- relations to the electrical conductivity, and its relation with polyanion rotations. In this work, we train three MLPs to investigate the physical mechanisms of charge transport in Li3PS4 and their effect on the electrical conductivity in its stable polymorphs. Each potential is trained over datasets com- puted at a different level of theory: GGA, metaGGA and hybrid functionals. In particular, we use the Perdew- Burke-Ernzerhof functional revisited for solids (PBEsol) [29, 62], the regularized version of the strongly con- strained and appropriately normed (r2SCAN) functional [63] and the PBE0 functional [64]. We explore the temperature dependence of the ionic conductivity of Li3PS4 showing that different functionals predict differ- ent critical temperatures for the onset of the conductive regime, which is roughly associated with the onset of a structural phase transition. We also elucidate the impor- tance of including the effects of the interionic correlation in the conductivity, by computing it with the full Green- Kubo (GK) theory of linear response [65, 66], instead of the Nernst-Einstein approximation commonly employed in the literature. Overall, we find that the PBE0 func- tional gives the best quantitative agreement with existing experimental measurements of the ionic conductivity of β-Li3PS4. Furthermore, we relate the onset of the superi- onic phase of the Li3PS4 compound with the PS4 flipping dynamics and find that discrete P-S flips induce a struc- tural phase transition from the non-conductive γ to a mixture of the β and α structures, that cannot be fully resolved at the size and time scale of these simulations.

Finally, we de- tect a second transition to a disordered phase with freely rotating polyanions at even higher temperatures that we attribute to the melting of the PS3− 4 sublattice. Both the transition to the conductive phase and the Li3PS4 melt- ing appear as peaks of the heat capacity and are thus associated with separate first-order phase transitions of this material. II. METHODS A. Training set construction and validation of the ML models We construct the training set for the ML models in an iterative fashion. A starting dataset of structures is generated by running NVT Car-Parrinello Molecular Dy- namics [67] with the PBEsol functional [62] as provided by the Quantum ESPRESSO package [68–71], for a set of selected temperatures (250 K, 500 K and 1000 K) and volumes. This initial dataset is then computed via more converged single-point DFT calculations with the PBEsol functional. Further details can be found in the Supporting Information. As a next step, we fit a preliminary MLP on this dataset and run finite-temperature Molecular Dynamics (MD) with i-PI [72] over the entire temperature range of interest (between 200 and 1000 K). Among the uncorre- lated structures generated in the resulting trajectories, only a subset consisting of the most diverse ones accord- ing to the Farthest-Point Sampling (FPS) method [73] is selected and recomputed using DFT. This active-learning loop, consisting of the regression of an MLP, MD simu- lations and re-calculation of a set of structures by DFT, allows us to extend the dataset until the model is deemed sufficiently accurate and robust. In order to generate datasets for the ML-SCAN and ML-PBE0 models, we select via FPS a subset of snapshots out of the whole PBEsol dataset and we use a two-level machine learning (2LML)", "page": 2, "position": 0}

In order to generate datasets for the ML-SCAN and ML-PBE0 models, we select via FPS a subset of snapshots out of the whole PBEsol dataset and we use a two-level machine learning (2LML) scheme [74] to train accurate potentials from a minimal number of expensive r2SCAN or PBE0 calcula- tions. The 2LML is a specific case of the general multi- level machine learning scheme, and consists in: training a ML model on the large PBEsol dataset, then comput- ing energy and forces at the r2SCAN (PBE0) level and finally training a new ML potential on the difference be- tween the ML-PBEsol predicted energies and forces and the true r2SCAN (PBE0) references [74, 75]. The final datasets consists of 2400 structures for the ML-PBEsol model, 740 for the ML-r2SCAN model and 790 struc- tures ML-PBE0 model. Within these datasets, a subset of 100 randomly selected structures is used as a test set for the ML-PBEsol model, while a subset of 40 structures is used for both the ML-r2SCAN and the ML-PBEsol model. PBEsol calculations are performed with Quan- tum ESPRESSO, while r2SCAN and PBE0 calculations are performed with VASP [76–78]. The training of all the models is performed targeting the cohesive energies to avoid offset issues induced by different pseudopoten- tials. Figure 2 shows the parity plot for the forces of the three models over their respective test sets. Table I con- tains the root-mean-square-errors (RMSE) for all mod- els, showing that our model can achieve errors similar (or better) than those obtained in other similar works [25, 26, 59].

Dynamical properties, like the mean square displacement and atomic diffusivity of Li ions, also appear to be properly reproduced by our ML potentials, as we have directly tested via MD sim- ulations of the α phase at high temperature, obtained with PBEsol ab initio potential and with its correspond- ing ML model, as reported in Sec. IV of the Supporting Information. B. Collective variables for Li3PS4 The three main polymorphs of Li3PS4 are differenti- ated by the relative orientation of the PS4 tetrahedra. In order to distinguish them and identify phase transitions in MD simulations, we construct two collective variables (CVs), based on the alignment, along the [100] direction, of the tetrahedra of the (010) planes (see Fig. 1). To this aim, we first compute the polar angle θSP, spanned by the", "page": 2, "position": 2}

In other words, the outer sum runs over P atoms that belong to a given crystallographic plane, while the inner sum runs on the four S atoms that belong to the tetrahedron centered around atom p. Whenever one tetrahedron is perfectly aligned along ±x, the cosine of one P-S angle is close to ±1, while the re- maining three have a value of cos(109.5◦) ≈−0.3338 or cos(70.5◦) ≈+0.3338 for +x and −x respectively, due to tetrahedral symmetry. We thus raise the cosine to the fifth power in Eq. (2), so that the result of the inner sum will be approximately equal to ±1. While any odd power greater that 1 would serve this scope,1 the fifth power gives the best results on preliminary tests.

III B we demonstrate that s1 completely distin- guishes the three polymorphs, as it takes on values close to +1 when the structure is similar to the perfect γ, −1 when it is similar to α and 0 when the structure is close to β or fully disordered. s2 instead measures a global alignment of the entire structure and does not resolve the β and α structure, as they both contain mixed PS4 orientations in equal proportions. Still, this CV is mean- ingful when combined with s1 as it carries information about the relative number of tetrahedra that are aligned along the positive and negative direction of the x-axis. For instance, it can distinguish between two perfect γ structures that are mirror-symmetric with respect to a (100) plane. C.

Nevertheless, its appli- cation to solid-state-electrolytes (SSEs) is burdened by systematic errors [84]: in fact, the large interatomic dy- namical correlations, both between carriers (Li+) and the solid matrix (PS43−) and among the carriers themselves, which is typical in systems with a high carrier concentra- tion like SSEs, is completely neglected by Eq. (7). The discrepancy between σ and σNE can be quantified by the Haven ratio [84–86]: HR = σNE σ (8) We redirect the reader to Sec. III D for a thorough com- parison between σ and σNE in the different polymorphs of Li3PS4. From a methodological standpoint, Eq.

These spurious effects arise for simulations run in the barycenter reference frame, where the position of the center of mass of the entire system is fixed. In practice, the difference between DLi computed in these two reference frames vanishes when the box size is increased [88]. Due to its very general formulation, the GK expres- sion of Eq.

D. ML-MD computational details We use the MLPs constructed in Sec. II A to investi- gate the physics of Li3PS4 via constant-temperature MD simulations using a combination of i-PI [72, 89], lammps [90, 91] and librascal [92]. In order to simulate the phase transitions and the charge transport in Li3PS4, we perform MD simulations in the NpT ensemble of a quasi- cubic 768-atom cell in all stable α, β and γ phases with a constant isotropic pressure of p = 0 atm for a set of tem- peratures between 200 K and 1000 K. The system’s center of mass is kept fixed during the simulations. A general- ized Langevin equation (GLE) thermostat [93, 94] is used to equilibrate the cell volume, while a stochastic veloc- ity rescaling (SVR) thermostat [95] is used to thermalize the velocity distribution of the atoms without affecting significantly the dynamical properties. The characteris- tic times of the barostat, the SVR thermostat and the MD timestep are set to 1 ps, 10 fs and 2 fs, respectively. We run these simulations long enough to ensure statisti- cal convergence of the ionic conductivity (see Sec. II C).

RESULTS In this section, we compare the results obtained with the PBEsol, PBE0 and r2SCAN functional and the cor- responding ML models, as described in Sec. II. In subsec- tion III A, we compute the electronic band structure of the β polymorph using DFT and show that the band gap predicted by the PBE0 functional is in good agreement with experiments, while PBEsol and r2SCAN consider- ably underestimate it.

Electronic band structure The Generalized Gradient Approximation (GGA) functionals offer a good compromise between accuracy and computational efficiency, making them a practical choice for a broad range of materials and systems. It is known, however, that they often fall short when it comes to accurately characterizing critical electronic properties, such as the electronic band gap, which is frequently un- derestimated in GGA, and the density of states [98–100]. In order to solve this problem, different functionals have been developed, such as meta-GGA [60] and hybrid func- tionals [61], that offer more accurate approximations of the exchange-correlation functional and are able to better describe long-range electron-electron interactions. These new functionals have enabled in more accurate predic- tions of electronic properties in a variety of different materials [101–106] and notably solid-state electrolytes [107–109]. In Fig. 3 we compare the band structure and the density of states (DOS) for the β phase com- puted with the PBEsol (GGA), r2SCAN (meta-GGA) and PBE0 (hybrid) functionals2.

B. Structural phase transitions We use the pair of CVs s1 and s2, introduced in Sec. II B, to investigate the presence of structural phase transitions appearing in the MD trajectories. As antic- ipated, s1 characterizes the mutual orientation of adja- cent (010) planes (i.e., even and odd numbers in Fig. 1) along the [100] direction. Consequently, s1 = −1 for the α phase, where the PS4 orientation of adjacent planes is antiparallel, s1 = 0 for the β phase (each plane has no net orientation of PS4 units), and s1 = +1 for the γ phase, where adjacent planes share the same orientation of PS4 tetrahedra along the positive x axis. Conversely, s2 measures the global orientation of PS4 tetrahedra and vanishes for both the α and β phases, while is equal to 1 for the γ phase. Figure 4 displays, with red dots, the evolution of the CVs across a set of MD simulations run with the ML-PBE0 model at different temperatures T, and initialized in the γ phase.

PS4 rotational dynamics and heat capacity Further insights into the rotational reorientation of PS4 planes and their relation with structural transitions can be obtained by a direct investigation of the rotational dynamics of PS4 tetrahedra, and specifically those that form [100] rows. Figure 6 shows the dynamics of the polar angles θSP, as defined in Eq. (1), for a set of four tetrahedra (row panels) that belong to the same [100] row in NpT simulations run with the ML-PBE0 model4. We also compare three trajectories initialized in the γ phase and equilibrated at T = 725 K, i.e. just below Tc = 750 K (left column); at T = Tc (central column); and above melting, at T = 900 K (right column). The four lines in the plots correspond to the dynamics of the four bonds that constitute each PS4 tetrahedron. At 725 K, only small angular fluctuations occur, with no reorientation of the tetrahedra. The average angles of the P-S bonds define the mean orientation of each tetra- hedron: as one of the P-S bonds always has an average value that is close to 0, the orientation is along the posi- tive x-axis (+x) during the entire simulation time, which is typical of the γ phase. Instead, the angles of the other three bonds oscillate around θ0 = 109.5◦(black dashed 4 The ML-PBEsol and the ML-r2SCAN models give the same qual- itative behaviour of the ML-PBE0 model.

The lower plots show the time evolution of the polar angle θSP as defined in Eq. (1) (angle with respect to the x-axis) for a set of three distinct tetrahedra forming a [100] row. Each panel represents the dynamics of the four PS bonds forming each tetrahedron.

The jump observed in the central panel of the left column corresponds to a rotation of the tetrahedron, that does not involve a re-orientation to- wards the negative x-axis. Instead, at the transition temperature (Tc = 750 K), simultaneous flips of one P-S bond from 0 to 70.5◦and another P-S bond from 109◦to 180◦correspond to the reorientations of the tetrahedra from +x to −x, consis- tently with the mechanism shown Fig. 5. Notably, these flips occur at the same instants of time for every tetra- hedron in a row (see, e.g., central column of Fig. 6 be- tween 1 and 2.5 ns), confirming that they are highly cor- related across [100] rows.

Specifically, we expect this transition to manifest in larger boxes by nucleation of ordered clusters with opposite orientation, as a result of the formation of defects with sudden changes of the PS4 orientation. We also note from panels b) of Fig. 6 that the time lag between subsequent flips is of the order of 1 ns. As we will see in Sec. III D, the presence of this long time scale will be important to elucidate the mechanism of charge transport in this material. At 900 K, the dynamics of the tetrahedra changes dra- matically and a second phase transition occurs. In par- ticular, all PS bonds across every tetrahedron span the entire range of angles between 0◦and 180◦. This suggests that, unlike the phases observed at lower temperatures, the tetrahedra are freely rotating in the simulation box. A direct inspection of the simulations indicates that this behaviour is accompanied by a melting of the system into a mixture of Li+ cations and PS43−anions (see also the P-P and P-S radial distribution functions shown in the Supporting Information, Fig. S9).

We can characterize more clearly the position of these peaks by analysing their relation with the microscopic quantities shown in panels b), c) and d). Since the first transition is associated with discrete PS4 flips, the in- crease of Cp is accompanied by a sudden change of slope of the angular fluctuations. Conversely, the transition to the molten phase occurs with a dramatic increase of both Dω and DP by one and two orders of magnitude, respectively. In other words, the action of thermal fluc- tuations at this high temperature destroys the periodic arrangement of P atoms, while the tetrahedra are still intact and can freely rotate by a rate given by Dω.

Conversely, the diffusion coefficients of panels c) and d) are physically meaningful when the simulations sample sufficiently many configurations with displaced P atoms and rotated PS4 anions. They are thus not well defined if the MD simulations are not fully ergodic [111].

Ionic conductivity and Haven ratio The ionic conductivity, σ, is the crucial property to identify promising solid-state electrolytes. As discussed in Sec. II C, the GK theory of linear response, in its HE formulation, gives us an efficient and statistically robust method to obtain an estimate of σ from equilibrium MD simulations at any target temperature. The upper panels of Fig. 8 shows the temperature de- pendence of the ionic conductivity at zero pressure for a set of NpT simulations that start from the ideal α, β and γ polymorph. Imperfect ergodicity, and the con- straints on cell shape, make simulations dependent on the initial conditions. Even though simulations can only be considered converged within the stability range of each phase and target functional, results outside this range still report useful information about their behavior when metastable. Thus, results are shown for every target functional and for all temperatures where the ionic con- ductivity is non-zero within the errorbars. All the ML models predict the γ/α phase to be the least/most conductive, while the β phase has intermedi- ate values of σ over a wide temperature window (up to 600-800 K depending on the model). This result is in agreement with previous computational studies [26, 112] and experimental measurements of the ionic conductiv- ity [20, 28] on the known crystalline phases of Li3PS4. The negative slope of the profiles of σ with respect to the inverse temperature is typical of the Arrhenius plots. In fact, since lithium-ion diffusion occurs via thermal activation, one can mathematically relates the Nernst- Einstein conductivity σNE with the activation energy of the Li-hopping process. In particular, higher negative slopes correspond to higher activation energies. The γ (α) phase is thus not only the least (most) conductive phase but also the one that has the largest (smallest) activation barrier for lithium diffusion. The high-temperature ends of the conductivity profiles of Fig. 8 (for T < 670 K for ML-PBEsol, T < 880 K for ML-r2SCAN and T < 770 K for ML-PBE0) give us additional insights.

The γ (α) phase is thus not only the least (most) conductive phase but also the one that has the largest (smallest) activation barrier for lithium diffusion. The high-temperature ends of the conductivity profiles of Fig. 8 (for T < 670 K for ML-PBEsol, T < 880 K for ML-r2SCAN and T < 770 K for ML-PBE0) give us additional insights. While the curves related to the three phases clearly span different conductivity ranges and show different slopes at low temperatures, this dif- ference is not noticeable any more at high temperatures and the conductivity and the activation energies all ap- proach the values of the α phase, with a characteristic kink that is most visible for simulations initialized in the γ phase. The critical temperature at which this kink oc- curs depends on the reference functional. This is a clear effect of the structural transition studied in Sec. III B and further investigated in Sec. III C by an analysis of the PS4 rotational dynamics. In other words, the PS4 flips that induce the transition from the γ polymorph to the partly-ordered β-α structure are responsible for the changes of the ionic conductivity due to the larger avail- ability of hopping sites for Li-ions [20], as well as a reduc- tion of the Li-hopping activation barrier. This conclusion is also highlighted by simulations of the β and α phases at low temperatures, that show large σ although PS4 flips are suppressed and librations are weak. To quantify the reduction of the activation energy due to the structural transition, in Table III, we report the activation energies that are fit to the Nernst-Einstein conductivities below and above the transition temperatures of each model (see Sec. X of the Supporting Information for additional de- tails). The effect of the transition is remarkable, as we observe a reduction of the activation energies of up to a factor of 6 depending on the reference DFT functional. Furthermore, the activation energies are very small above the transition, with values ranging between 0.25 and 0.32 eV. These values are very close to the values", "page": 9, "position": 1}

Furthermore, the activation energies are very small above the transition, with values ranging between 0.25 and 0.32 eV. These values are very close to the values observed for the α phase and smaller than the β phase (see Table IV), indicating a superionic behavior. In contrast, we note that the transition to the molten salt, that we observed for T > 800 K in Sec. III C has practically no effect on the conductivity profiles. This analysis, combined with the results of Secs. III B and III C, also allows us to rule out any paddle-wheel effect, whereby PS4 motion is time-correlated with Li- hopping and increases Li-ion diffusion. In fact, due to the different rates of PS4 flipping (≈one every ns) and Li-ion hopping (≈one every ps) even at large temper- ature right below melting, the two mechanisms cannot be related. This point is strengthened in Fig. S12 of the Supporting Information, showing the fast and linear in- crease of the mean square displacement of lithium ions in the simulation at 750 K of Fig. 6 over a 30-ps time window. Instead, the interaction between Li-ion diffusion and PS4 libration, which share the same time scale, may be important, as we have directly inspected in Sec. III E by analyizing the local contributions to σ stemming from the interaction between Li and S ions. The lower panels of Fig. 8 show the temperature depen- dence of the Haven ratio, HR, computed using Eq. (8). As anticipated in Sec. II C, this coefficient quantifies the discrepancy between σ and σNE.

This effect is most pronounced in the α phase, where HR ≈0.4 below melting, meaning that the NE estimate underestimates the GK conductivity by more than a factor of two. At high temperatures, the Haven ratio slightly increases, indicating that the ma- terial becomes disordered. This might be a result of the phase transformations of the solid matrix, which we expect to weaken the interionic correlations. Still, the Haven ratio never exceeds 0.8, even at 1000 K for any of the ML models studied.

In the case of the β phase, the ML- r2SCAN and ML-PBE0 predict an activation energy that is greater than the one computed with the ML-PBEsol model, but overall the values are close to the experimen- tal results. For the α phase the activation energies are particularly close to the experiment. These last results are remarkably good in particular when comparing them with the prediction of the classical empirical potential re- cently introduced by Forrester et al [23]. For this model, the activation energy for stoichiometric α-Li3PS4 is much larger (0.40 eV) than the experimental result and similar to the value of the β phase. The empirical potential also predicts the α phase to be only slightly more conductive than the β phase for all temperatures.

E. Spatial correlations In this last section, we investigate the role of local cor- relations in determining the full ionic conductivity by computing the spatial dependence of the integral of the partial cross-correlation functions, ILiA, between lithium atoms and other atomic species A = Li, P, S. However, before we start this analysis, it is necessary to make a few technical considerations. While the total conductiv- ity does not depend on the frame of reference, due to the charge neutrality of the simulation cell, the value of any partial correlation does depend on it, as we show in the SI. For instance, in the reference frame of the matrix, all the Green-Kubo integrals of the partial correlation between Li and the other species (P and S) vanish. In contrast, in the reference frame of the center of mass of the entire system the solid matrix recoils due to the dif- fusion of the center of mass of Li atoms (see SI). To carry out our analysis, we choose the reference frame where the center of mass of the PS solid matrix remains stationary, e.g. P i∈P,S vi = 0 at every instant. This choice is moti- vated by the fact that this reference frame is in principle the same in which the lithium diffusivity, entering the NE relation, Eq. (7), should be computed. Moreover, this is the most natural choice for a battery, since in this refer- ence frame the solid matrix of the battery is not moving. To study the", "page": 11, "position": 0}

Moreover, this is the most natural choice for a battery, since in this refer- ence frame the solid matrix of the battery is not moving. To study the spatial dependence of the integral of the correlation functions we perform a Gaussian kernel den- sity estimation (KDE) [116] of the correlation functions: ILiA(r) ≡ P i∈Li P j∈A R ∞ 0 Cij(t, r) dt P i∈Li P j∈A ¯wij(r) (13) Cij(t, r) ≡1 3 ⟨vi(t) · vj(0) wij(0, r)⟩ (14) wij(t, r) ≡ 1 √ 2πς2 exp h −(rij(t)−r)2 2ς2 i (15) where i runs over all Li atoms and j runs over all the atoms of type A; wij(t, r) is a Gaussian weight with width ς, which we set to 0.33˚A; ¯wij(r) is the time average of wij(r) over the whole trajectory. The connection between Eq. (13) and the ionic conductivity of Eq. (5) is readily established. In fact, within the KDE, Ω NLiNA X i∈Li X j∈A ¯wij(r) ≈ ς→0 4πr2 gLiA(r), (16) where gLiA(r) is the radial distribution function between the Li and the species A. Therefore, the integral over r of ILiLi(r) plays the role of the correction to the NE relation that is needed to recover the full GK conductivity: σ −σNE ∝ Z ∞ 0 ILiLi(r)gLiLi(r)4πr2dr (17) Fig. 9 shows ILiA(r) for different values of r. The most relevant correlations come from the Li-Li and Li-S inter- actions, while the correlations with the P are compatible with zero for any r. As expected, for large r all the corre- lations become compatible with zero. The oscillations in the correlations functions follow, as expected, the peaks in the radial distribution function gLiA(r) (lower panel), and show that only the first shell of Li atoms and the first two of S atoms are important for the conductivity.

The oscillations in the correlations functions follow, as expected, the peaks in the radial distribution function gLiA(r) (lower panel), and show that only the first shell of Li atoms and the first two of S atoms are important for the conductivity. The correlation of the first shell of Li is strongly positive in agreement with Ref. [117], where it was shown that the hopping of Li atom in one direction facilitates the movement of the other Li in the same direction. IV. CONCLUSIONS In this work, we have presented a computational study of lithium ortho-thiophosphate via multiple ma- chine learning models, targeting DFT references of in- creasing accuracy, and elucidating the critical role of PS4 flips and phase transitions in determining the observed superionic behavior of Li3PS4. We find that all the ML models predict two distinct phase transitions. First, we observe a transition from the γ to a partly ordered phase with both β and α alignments, that cannot be fully re- solved at the time and length scale of the MD simulations. While this limitation does not allow to provide a predic- tion of the full phase diagram of Li3PS4, we identify the presence of collective PS4 flips as the driving mechanism. Secondly, we observe the melting of the system into its constituent Li+ cations and PS3− 4 polyanions at elevated temperatures (>800 K). Both these transitions are asso- ciated with drastic changes in the rotational dynamics of the PS4 groups as a function of the temperature and appear as distinct peaks of the heat capacity. We also compute the ionic conductivity of Li3PS4 in all its stable polymorphs and elucidate the importance of", "page": 11, "position": 2}

We find that the interionic correlations account for consider- able deviations between the NE and the GK estimates, as quantified by a Haven ratio that is smaller than one in ev- ery polymorph at all temperatures, except for the weakly conductive γ structure at low temperatures. Notably, the Haven ratio reaches values of 0.4 in the highly conductive α-phase, suggesting that a pure NE approach can result in the underestimation of the conductivity by more than a factor of two. From a spatially-resolved analysis per- formed in the reference frame of the solid matrix, we find that most of these interionic correlations come from the first shell of Li-Li neighbors, thus indicating that a con- certed Li-ion hopping is a key aspect of charge transport in this material, in agreement with Ref. [117]. Finally, we investigate how the observed phase tran- sitions of Li3PS4 affect the ionic conductivity. We find that the occurrence of correlated PS4 flips results in a dramatic decrease of the activation energy (up to a factor of six) when the system transitions from the γ to a mixed β-α phase. Furthermore, we show that subsequent PS4 flips occur at the", "page": 12, "position": 0}

We find that the occurrence of correlated PS4 flips results in a dramatic decrease of the activation energy (up to a factor of six) when the system transitions from the γ to a mixed β-α phase. Furthermore, we show that subsequent PS4 flips occur at the time scale of nanoseconds, that is much larger than the typical time laps between two subsequent lithium ion hoppings, in agreement with Refs. [117]. We thus conclude that the sudden change in the PES of the lithium ions that is due to the rearrangement of the PS4 tetrahedra is the physical mechanism for the observed superionic behavior of Li3PS4. Crucially, this mecha- nism is fundamentally different from the one proposed in Ref. [31]. There, a characteristic paddlewheel effect was observed in AIMD-PBE simulations at elevated tem- peratures and invoked to explain the neutron diffraction measurements showing a polyanion reorientational dis- order. The AIMD simulations were however limited in size and thus showed much larger finite-size effects than the ones we observe in this work, including an artificial stabilization of the solid phase up to temperatures (1200 K) that are much larger than the nominal melting point of Li3PS4. We also stress that the paddlewheel effect itself was observed in AIMD simulations at these very high temperatures, thus likely making it an artifact of the small simulation box that was used there. The ML models that we present in this work overcome these lim- itations and offer a more natural interpretation of the experimental results. This finding also suggests addi- tional directions of research in the quest for a promising solid electrolyte and potentially a way to design new tar- get compounds. In particular, we expect that tentative modifications of Li3PS4 to stabilize its superionic phases at room temperature, by e.g. atomic substitution and amorphization, should be accompanied by a reduction of the polyanion rotational free energy barrier, that limits the spatial extension of the PS4 fluctuations.

Further developments of this work thus imply a detailed thermo- dynamic study of the phase transitions observed here and a comparison of multiple different SE compounds, with the aim of suggesting a target compound for experimen- tal synthesis. While providing these useful mechanistic insights, our ML models show a remarkable agreement with experi- ment in the prediction of a number of independent quan- tities. Specifically, the PBE0 functional provides the best agreement on the prediction of the electronic band gap, while the associated ML-PBE0 model reaches overall the best accuracy on the prediction of lithium activation en- ergies in the β and α phase, the ionic conductivities at 298 and 500 K and the melting temperature. In partic- ular, our results proved to be much more accurate than empirical potentials [23], that are often used to overcome the high computational cost of AIMD. These results and the observed dependence of the finite-temperature pre- dictions of the ML models on the DFT reference indicate the necessity of using more accurate functionals for the description of transport properties in solid electrolytes, than state-of-the-art GGA functionals. Machine learning becomes then a necessary step in modelling this class of materials, as ab-initio studies with the PBE0 functional are far beyond reach because of their very high compu- tational cost. In conclusion, we have shown how the use of machine learning potentials for a prototypical solid electrolyte captures the mechanisms of the transition to its supe-", "page": 12, "position": 2}
