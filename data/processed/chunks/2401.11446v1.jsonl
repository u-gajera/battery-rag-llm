The Li-ion insertion/de- insertion mechanism and the resulting structural changes are known to exert a severe strain on the lattice, and consequently leading to performance degradation. Here, with a view to shed more light on the effect of such strain on the structural properties of the cathode material, we have systematically investigated the pressure dependence of structural and transport properties of an LixCoO2 single crystal, grown using 5% excess Li in the precursors.

INTRODUCTION: LiCoO2 has been extensively used as a typical cathode material in lithium-ion batteries due to a high theoretical energy density and significant structural stability during insertion and removal of lithium ions [1,2]. However, severe voltage decay of lithium-ion batteries, upon extended cycling, is one of the limiting factors regarding its utilization [3]. Therefore, tremendous efforts have been undertaken in recent years to understand the origin of the voltage fade. The delocalization of electronic states was initially suggested as a possible key factor for the voltage fade [4]. It was widely believed that Li extraction occurs via a solid solution reaction and structural transitions might occur during the process, impacting the electrical properties and mobility of lithium ions [4-6]. An insulator-to-metal-like transition was reported with a minor change in the lithium concentration [6]. However, a recent study, combining in- situ x-ray diffraction and ex-situ STEM measurements [7], indicates that a significant cause of this voltage fade is related to structural factors, specifically to the transformation from layered rhombohedral structure (space group R3̅m) of LiCoO2 to spinel-like trigonal (P3̅m1) structure of the completely delithiated end-member CoO2. The layered crystal structure of LixCoO2 contains edge-sharing CoO6 octahedra, separated by octahedrally coordinated Li along [001] direction. The layered structure [Fig. 1 (a)] adopts -ABCABC- (O3 phase) type stacking sequence of oxygen ions along [001] direction [7]. Upon delithiation, a collective and quasi- continuous glide of CoO6 slabs was reported to trigger a transition from O3 to O1 (having - AA- type stacking sequence of oxygen) phase, before the layered to spinel-like trigonal (P3̅m1) phase transformation. During the transition from O3 to O1, gradual angle (δ), defined as the angle between the cobalt ions along [001] crystallographic axis [Fig. 1(a)], decreases to zero, from δ ~ 9.7° for O3 phase. Moreover, during the phase transformation from the O3 to O1 phase, numerous intermediate phases, including the pseudomorphic phase of Li-Co antisites (due to the gradual migration of Co ions from the CoO6 slab to the Li sites) were reported to", "page": 2, "position": 0}

With an increase in the Li-Co antisites, a layered-to-trigonal type transition took place, in which layered LixCoO2 structure transformed in a trigonal phase (P3̅m1), which was reported to have a profound influence on the capacity fading and optimization of high-energy density for lithium-ion batteries [7]. The overall phase transition was explained in terms of a gradual angle. The reported value of gradual angle was 9.712° for x = 1, which dropped to zero for x = 0.3. In-situ x-ray diffraction results reported in ref. [7] corresponds to a quasi-thermodynamic condition on powder samples, therefore obtaining quantitative information about the phase fraction of different phases becomes difficult. Due to this complexity, thus far, conclusive evidence of the structural and electronic structure details, as well as about thermodynamic phase stability of phases with different lithium content has been lacking. In order to gain insight into these strain-induced pseudomorphic phases occurring during lithiation and de-lithiation, we investigated the effect of external pressure on the structural and transport properties of an LixCoO2 single crystal with a view to explore the possibility of pressure-driven stabilization of such phases. The LiCoO2 single crystal which was synthesized by optical zone floating technique [8], with 5% excess lithium, was subjected to high pressure to study and analyse its structural properties and electronic transport. The present study shows the co-existence of Li0.12Co0.88O disordered rock-salt phase (space group Fm3̅m), along with the main LiCoO2 rhombohedral phase (R3̅m) in the crushed single crystal sample. We observe that the gradual angle, derived from the Rietveld refinement analysis of the synchrotron diffraction data, is 9.848° at 0 GPa for the rhombohedral phase and increases to 9.994° at 10.6 GPa. An increase in resistance with decreasing temperature reveals the semi- metallic nature of the sample. The density of states N(EF) reduces and the activation energy (Ea) increases, and the derived value of piezo-resistivity increases with applied pressure.

The observed increase in the gradual angle with an increase in the pressure for the rhombohedral phase, while having a constant lithium content, also suggests a novel path where one could apply internal negative pressure by using the dopants with less ion radius at Co or Li sites to synthesize LixCoO2, for mitigating the gradual structural transition from the O3 to the O1 phase during Li insertion/de-insertion. We point out that the increase in the gradual angle must be related to the presence of intergrowth of cubic phase’s crystallographic domains in the material, thereby inducing the stabilization of the rhombohedral phase in the presence of large lattice strain due to applied pressure. We find that the relative changes in lattice parameters and volume, as a function of pressure, are small for the disordered rock-salt phase (Fm3̅m), compared to the layered rhombohedral phase (R3̅m). Our results therefore suggest the possibility of the disordered rock-salt phase Li1-xCoxO acting as a transitional phase during the Li de-insertion/insertion process to and from the layered phase and provides a rationale for the feasibility of designing such mixed phase materials for use as a cathode in lithium-ion batteries.", "page": 4, "position": 0}

Sample Synthesis: A conventional solid-state reaction method was used to create a polycrystalline sample of LiCoO2 from 99.99% Co3O4 (Alfa Aesar Inc.) and 99.99% Li2CO3 (LTS Research Labs Inc.) as precursors. Further, it was used to prepare feed and seed rods to grow a single crystal sample. The high-quality, LiCoO2 single crystals are grown in an Ar-atmosphere of 9 bar and using slow growth speeds of 1–2 mm/h, using feed rods containing 5% excess Li content by optical zone floating technique (Crystal Systems Co., Japan, FZ-T-10000-H-VII-VPO-PC) [8].

The lithium composition of grown crystals was determined using the iCAP 6300 Duo inductively coupled plasma-optical atomic emission spectrometer (ICP-AES). 2.2. High Pressure XRD: Ambient and high-pressure X-ray powder diffraction (HP-XRD) data at room temperature were collected at the Elettra Synchrotron Center (Xpress beamline), Trieste, Italy. A membrane-driven symmetric diamond anvil cell (DAC) with a culet size of 400 μm and a PACE-5000-based automatic membrane drive was used. The sample chamber for the HP-XRD was prepared by intending a 200 μm thickness 301 stainless steel metal foil to 50 μm and drilling a 160 μm hole in the center.

We find our calculated band gap with U = 1 and 3 eV to be consistent with the experimental gap (Eg ~ 2.5 [18] and 2.6 [19] eV for LiCoO2 and CoO, respectively). We used a converged plane-wave cutoff energy EGcut = 650 eV on a 4-atom primitive cell with a 6x6x6 and 8x8x8 Γ-centered Monkhorst-Pack electronic k-point mesh for LiCoO2 and CoO (spin-polarized calculation), respectively.

DISCUSSION: Now we discuss the synthesis and thermodynamic stability of the observed disordered rock- salt structure (Li0.12Co0.88O, Fm3̅m), and its potential as a high-capacity electrode material. This kind of disordered rock-salt phase has been observed (i) after mechanical alloying of LiCoO2 for a long time (~ 64 hours) [33] (ii) during the solid-state reaction, with Li2O2 and CoO mixture pressed into pellets in an argon atmosphere and pellet heated in a sealed container (maximum up to x = 0.2 in LixCo1-xO), due to the presence of a phase boundary [34]. In the present study, where the crystals grow out of the melt, the dc magnetization study indicates the presence of the disordered rock-salt phase Li0.12Co0.88O in single crystal samples (Fig. 10), where the peak corresponding to the antiferromagnetic (AFM) transition temperature for Li0.12Co0.88O phase at 251 K has been observed. The Li0.12Co0.88O phase is thermodynamically stable as the magnetization and diffraction measurements were recorded several months after the growth. Here it may be noted that the end member, CoO2, of the solid solution LixCoO2, was reported to have CdI2-type trigonal crystal structure (space group P3̅m1, lattice parameter a = 2.82, c = 4.29 Å) [35]. The crystal structure of CoO2 was reported to contain highly repulsive layers of O2-. This combined with the fact that cobalt ions in CoO2 are in a 4+ oxidation state makes it thermodynamically unstable and it transforms to CoOOH (space group", "page": 17, "position": 0}

In general, the crystal structure of the CoOx system strongly depends up on the thermodynamic relative stability of the cobalt oxidation states under different synthesis conditions, that is, oxidizing or reducing atmosphere. Recent global potential energy surface calculations [36] have revealed that CoOx has three thermodynamically stable composition under ambient conditions: (i) wurtzite CoO (P63mc, #186) (ii) rock-salt CoO (Fm3̅m, #225), (iii) spinel Co3O4 (Fd3̅m, #227), with Co3O4 being the most stable phase. Both wurtzite and rock-salt phases of CoO transform to spinel Co3O4 phase upon annealing at 240 °C under atmospheric air. Upon heating above 320 °C, under an inert, vacuum atmosphere or at high pressure [0.8 − 6.0 GPa at ambient temperature], the wurtzite CoO phase irreversibly transforms to rock-salt CoO, via a reconstructive solid-state phase transition with the breaking of Co−O bonds, having a high barrier. Although calculations show that wurtzite CoO is energetically more stable than rock- salt CoO [37] the possibility of adaptation of structural defects makes rock-salt CoO more stable, as found in experiments where wurtzite phase has only been observed in nanocrystals thus far [38]. The observed disordered rock-salt cubic phase Li0.12Co0.88O (Fm3̅m) in the present study possibly also arises due to its capacity to adopt more structural defects (Li and Co share the same site resulting in higher configurational entropy), and this feature further assists in the structural stability of the rhombohedral phase in the presence of large lattice strains. The phase diagrams of the layer-structured cathode materials for Li-ion batteries, LiMO2 (M = Ni, Co, Mn, and dopants) has recently been investigated using density functional theory calculations. Three phases, the spinel, rock-salt, and layered phases were reported to be thermodynamically stable, except for LiCoO2 where spinel phase was found to be thermodynamically unstable [39]. For Li1.2Ni0.2Mn0.6O2, a phase transformation pathway, i.e., from a layered to a spinel-like (Fd3̅m) to a disordered rock-salt phase (Fm3̅m), was described", "page": 18, "position": 0}

Historically, disordered rock-salt-type phase Li0.12Co0.88O (Li1-xCoxO-type, cubic), found in the present study, is considered as “electrochemically inactive” and expected to block lithium diffusion pathway and may result in a poor electrochemical performance. However, recent experimental and theoretical research reveals that oxides with the disordered rock salt structure have potential as high-capacity electrode materials [41]. For the stoichiometric Li-excess disordered rock-salt material Li1.211Mo0.467Cr0.3O2 [42], excellent energy density of 660 Wh kg−1 at 2.5 V, was reported, which is rarely achieved even in layered Li-transition metal oxides. The observed high energy density was ascribed to percolation of a certain type of active diffusion channels, 0-transition metal channels with no face-sharing transition metal ion, in disordered rock-salt phase, if enough Li excess is available. Moreover, intrinsic disorder on the cation lattice was reported to result in small and isotropic volume changes, as a function of Li concentration, resulting in less mechanical stress and capacity loss. Designing mixed phase materials like the one in this study therefore becomes a viable path that could result in increased structural stability despite increasing lattice strain during Li insertion/de-insertion processes.", "page": 19, "position": 0}

Arrow shows AFM transition temperature for Li0.12Co0.88O phase. Reported AFM transition for CoO is 289 K. The observed reduced temperature of 251 K is possibly due to lithium substitution at the cobalt site. Conclusion: Detailed high-pressure x-ray diffraction study using synchrotron radiation source and transport measurements are carried out on a LixCoO2 single crystal sample, grown under reducing atmosphere (high argon pressure) using the optical floating zone technique, with a view to explore the effect of lattice strain that occurs during lithiation/de-lithiation processes. The co-existence of a significant fraction of Li0.12Co0.88O cubic phase (Fm3̅m) along with the LiCoO2 rhombohedral phase (R3̅m) is observed in the crushed single crystal sample. The volume fraction of the rhombohedral and cubic phase is 60:40, which remains unchanged up to 10.6 GPa. No structural phase transition has been observed up to 10.6 GPa, indicating substantial structural stability of the two-phase material under large lattice strain. An increase in resistance with a decrease in temperature has revealed the semi-metallic nature of the sample. The derived value of piezo-resistivity increases with applied pressure.

A small polaronic hopping model has been adopted in order to explain the conduction mechanism in the insulating region and the activation energy (Ea) has been calculated by fitting SPH relation and it is found that Ea increases with increasing applied pressure. Density of states at the Fermi level level, N(EF), for various pressures has been extracted by using a 2D variable range hopping model. N(EF) is found to be decreasing with increasing pressure. The above-discussed results derived from the resistivity confirm that the semi-metallic behaviour was enhanced by the application of pressure. The obtained results can be qualitatively explained via density functional theory (DFT) and thermodynamics modelling. For the rhombohedral phase, the derived value of gradual angle [9.848° and 9.994° at 0 and 10.6 GPa, respectively], which plays a crucial role in layered-to-trigonal phase transformation upon insertion/de-insertion of Li, increases with increasing pressure. The observed increase in the gradual angle, with no change in the lithium contents, further points to the increased stability of the rhombohedral majority phase and also suggests a novel path of applying internal pressure using the dopants at Li and Co sites to synthesize LixCoO2, with a view to mitigate the layered-to-trigonal phase transformation in cathode materials for lithium-ion batteries. We also observe that the relative changes in lattice parameters and volume, as a function of pressure, are small for the disordered rock-salt phase (Fm3̅m), compared to the layered rhombohedral phase (R3̅m). Our results therefore suggest the possibility of the disordered rock-salt phase Li1-xCoxO acting as a transitional phase during the Li de-insertion/insertion process to and from the layered phase and provides a rationale for the feasibility of designing such mixed phase materials for use as a cathode in lithium-ion batteries.
