From a single molecular dynamics simulation many proper- ties relevant to diﬀusion can be obtained, in- cluding the diﬀusion path, attempt frequency, activation energies, and collective diﬀusion pro- cesses. These detailed diﬀusion properties pro- vide a thorough understanding of diﬀusion in solid electrolytes, and provides direction for the design of improved solid electrolyte materials. Here a thorough analysis methodology is devel- oped, and applied to DFT MD simulations of Li-ion diﬀusion in β-Li3PS4. The methodology presented is generally applicable to crystalline materials and facilitates the analysis of molec- ular dynamics simulations. The code used for the analysis is freely available at: https://bitbucket.org/niekdeklerk/md-analysis- with-matlab. The results on β-Li3PS4 demonstrate that jumps between bc-planes limit the conductiv- ity of this important class of solid electrolyte materials. The simulations indicate that by adding Li-interstitials or Li-vacancies the rate limiting jump process can be accelerated sig- niﬁcantly, which induces three dimensional dif- fusion, resulting in an increased Li-ion diﬀu- sivity. Li-vacancies can be introduced through Br-doping, which is predicted to result in an order of magnitude larger Li-ion conductivity in β-Li3PS4. Furthermore, the present simula- tions rationalise the improved Li-ion diﬀusivity upon O-doping through the creation of local Li-interstitials. Introduction To prevent further global warming by green- house gas emissions it is necessary to move from fossil fuels towards renewable energy sources. For transport applications other energy carri- ers, such as hydrogen and batteries, are con- sidered. Of the current technologies which can replace fossil fuels in vehicles, batteries result in the lowest greenhouse gas emissions1, especially if renewable sources are used for the energy pro- duction. However, safety concerns and the limited range of current battery electric vehicles are slowing down their implementation. Solid state batter-", "page": 0, "position": 0}

Fewer sodium containing compounds with such high conductivities are known, most likely the result of less intensive research in this area, but several have been es- tablished, including β-alumina4 and Na3PS4 5. The combination of high ionic conductivity and large electrochemical stability is challenging2,6, but electrochemical stability does not have very strict requirements. A solid electrolyte can be successful if its decomposition products are stable, have a reasonable ionic conductivity and low electronic conductivity6, similar to the functioning of solid-electrolyte interface (SEI) layers for liquid electrolytes. The complex de- mands on solid electrolytes necessitates funda- mental research towards solid electrolyte prop- erties and new solid electrolyte materials. Computer simulations are playing an impor- tant role in understanding and directing ma- terials design towards improved battery perfor- mance. For example, calculations have shown that the electrochemical stability of solid elec- trolytes is enhanced by passivating decomposi- tion products6, that strain can enhance diﬀu- sion7, how Li-ion diﬀusion can be increased in anti-perovskites8 and Na3PS4 5,9, and why bond frustration is beneﬁcial for Li-ion diﬀusion10. In solid state electrolytes the high concentra- tion of diﬀusing atoms, 31 mol/L in β-Li3PS4, can lead to complex interactions and diﬀu- sion behaviour. Diﬀusion can involve collective jumps11 and lattice vibrations9,12, which are all included in molecular dynamics (MD) simula- tions since all possible motions of ions and their interactions are taken into account. Further- more, MD simulations can show unanticipated diﬀusion behaviour13, whereas static calcula- tions (e.g. nudged elastic band and bond va- lence) are limited by the imagination of the re- searcher. To understand diﬀusion in solid state electrolytes MD simulations are thus a powerful tool, allowing the dynamic diﬀusion processes to be studied in detail. Although MD simulations have been shown to provide understanding of complicated diﬀusion processes, typically only the tracer diﬀusivity is extracted, from which an activation energy is calculated by assuming Arrhenius behaviour.

In order to make such thor- ough analysis of MD simulations more easily available we present an approach, here demon- strated for β-Li3PS4, that allows to extract the detailed diﬀusional properties based on a MD simulation and the crystalline structure of the studied material. The approach determines jump rates, activation energies, attempt fre- quency, vibrational amplitude, radial distribu- tion functions, possible collective motions, site occupancies, tracer diﬀusivity, and the correla- tion factor. The ﬁrst part of this paper describes the ap- proach that is followed to obtain the diﬀusional properties from a single MD simulation. In the second part MD simulations on β-Li3PS4 are analysed, exemplifying how the developed ap- proach helps in understanding diﬀusion in solid state electrolytes, and how this provides direc- tion to design improved solid electrolyte mate- rials.

Information from MD simu- lations After performing a MD simulation the position of all the atoms at every time step is known. Typically, this result is used to determine the tracer diﬀusivity (D∗) via the mean squared dis- placement17: D∗= 1 2dN N X i=1 ri(t) t 2! (1) where ri(t) is the displacement of a single atom, t the simulated time, N the number of diﬀus- ing atoms, and d the number of diﬀusion di- mensions.

Provided that the atomic dis- placement is signiﬁcantly larger than the vibra- tion amplitude, the tracer diﬀusivity provides a good quantitative indication of the ionic diﬀu- sion. However, to get a thorough understanding much more properties related to the diﬀusion process can be obtained from a single MD sim- ulation, including: • Amplitude of vibrations • Attempt frequency • Site occupations • Jump rates • Correlation factor • Activation energies • Collective jumps • Radial Distribution Functions Amplitude of vibrations Atomic vibrations in a crystal are the ’back and forth’ movement of an atom around a (meta)stable position. From a MD simulation the position of all atoms is known at any time, hence the direction of movement and displace- ment can be obtained. The atomic vibrations can be determined by monitoring the change in the direction of movement, and the vibra- tional amplitude is obtained by integrating the displacement of each atom until the derivative of the displacement changes sign, which corre- sponds to a change in the direction of move- ment. Doing this for all the atoms of inter- est gives a distribution of vibrational displace- ments, an example of which is shown in Fig. 1. By ﬁtting a Gaussian function to the ob- tained distribution the standard deviation in vibrational displacement can be obtained, pro- viding an estimate of the average amplitude of vibrations in the crystal.

Attempt frequency Based on (the sign of) the derivative of displace- ment the vibration time of an atom is known, from which the vibrational spectrum can be ob- tained via a Fourier transformation, shown for Li-ions in β-Li3PS4 in Fig. 2. From the fre- quency spectrum the attempt frequency can be obtained if we consider every vibration of a (dif- fusing) atom as an attempt. Thus we deﬁne the average vibration frequency as the attempt fre- quency (ν∗), which is necessary to determine the relation between jump rates and activation energies. The approach of obtaining the attempt fre- quency presented here is very diﬀerent from the usual approaches. Several deﬁnitions of the at- tempt frequency exist18, all of which require the determination of the transition state and cal- culation of the phonon spectrum for the stable and the transition state19. However, often these calculations are not performed, and a ’standard value’ of 1 ∗1013 Hz is used18,20. In comparison to other methods the present 3", "page": 2, "position": 1}

Furthermore, since the attempt frequency is obtained from a single MD simulation the in- ﬂuence of temperature, structural parameters, etc., on the attempt frequency are included and can be investigated. Site occupancy In crystalline ionic conductors diﬀusion occurs through transitions between relatively stable sites. Typically these crystallographic sites are known from diﬀraction experiments, but if these are not known the sites can be extracted from a MD simulation through data mining21. The condition used for site occupancy is that the distance of the ion to the centre of the crys- tallographic site is smaller than the site-radius. At present the site-radius is deﬁned as twice the vibrational amplitude, which can for instance be reduced to prevent sites from overlapping. Jump rates When the crystallographic sites are known, de- tecting the transitions between sites that occur in a MD simulation is straightforward. Count- ing the number of jumps (J) between (types of) sites provides the mean jump rate (Γ) using: Γ = J Nt (3) where N is the number of diﬀusing atoms, and t the simulation time. The standard deviation in the jump rate can be calculated by dividing the simulation into several parts, in order to esti- mate the reliability of the MD simulations. As demonstrated recently14 determination of the diﬀerent jump rates in a crystal provides direct insight in which jump process is rate-limiting for diﬀusion. This information can be used to design crystal structures with larger atomic dif- fusivity. Because NMR relaxation experiments can directly probe the jump rates, comparison with the jump rates from MD simulations can be used to validate the MD simulations22, or to better understand the complex results from NMR experiments23.

To get an estimate of the fraction of jumps which contribute to macroscopic diﬀusion the correlation factor (f), also known as the Haven ratio (Hr), is calculated20,24: f = D∗ DJ (5) Activation energies The probability that an actual jump from one site to another occurs is determined by the ac- tivation energy for this transition. As shown in Figure 3 a jump from site A to B can have a diﬀerent energy barrier as the reverse jump due to the diﬀerence in site energy, even though the number of A-B and B-A jumps will be the same in equilibrium. By taking into account the res- idence time at each site an ’eﬀective’ jump rate can be determined, thus taking the eﬀect of the site energy into account.

The eﬀective jump rate, Γeﬀ, diﬀers from the jump rate in equation 3 by taking into account the fraction of time that the diﬀusing atoms occupies a site (o): Γeﬀ= J Nto (6) Using the eﬀective jump rate the activation en- ergy (∆EA) can be calculated25: ∆EA = −kBT ln(Γeﬀ ν∗) (7) where kB is Boltzmann’s constant, T the tem- perature in Kelvin, and ν∗the attempt fre- quency. Since jump and attempt frequencies are temperature dependent the activation en- ergy may also be a function of temperature. Such non-Arrhenius behaviour can be investi- gated by performing MD simulations at dif- ferent temperatures. Finally, the diﬀerence in activation energy between back and forth jumps provides the energy diﬀerence between two sites, which can be used to predict chang- ing site-occupancies with temperature. Collective jumps The large concentration of diﬀusing atoms in solid electrolytes, 31 mol/L in β-Li3PS4, is likely to result in interactions between the dif- fusing Li-atoms. This potentially causes col- lective jump processes11, which may have a se- vere impact on macroscopic diﬀusion26,27. MD simulations are a powerful tool for investigating complicated collective jump processes 1. Know- ing the position and time of jumps allows to determine if jumps are correlated in time and space. At present the spatial condition for cor- related motion is assumed to be slightly larger as the largest jump distance between Li-sites in the crystal. For β-Li3PS4 this is 4.5 ˚A , in which 4 ˚A between the bc-planes is the largest jump distance. Because each diﬀusing atom changes direction after a vibration it is unlikely that collective motions last for multi- ple vibrations. A rational time condition for collective motion thus is the average time of a single vibration, which is equal to the period of the attempt frequency ( 1 ν∗seconds).

Radial Distribution Functions The atomic environment determines the forces and energy barriers that govern the behaviour of diﬀusing atoms. The atomic environment can be represented using a Radial Distribution Function (RDF), which eﬀectively reveals the density of diﬀerent elements as a function of distance from the atom of interest. For exam- ple, this has shown to be useful for Na3PS4, where the RDF’s from MD simulations sug- gested that Na-vacancies are essential for in- creased Na-diﬀusion9. As the position of all atoms is available at any time step from a MD simulation, RDF’s can be readily obtained for any site, atom or element. Summary Summarising, if the crystallographic sites are known, detailed diﬀusion properties can be ex- tracted from MD simulations. In principle a single MD simulation, in which each type of jump occurs a signiﬁcant number of times, al- ready provides detailed insight into diﬀusion, including the diﬀusion path, attempt frequency, 1The process which we call ’collective’ jumps is also referred to as ’correlated’ or ’concerted’ jumps in the literature. 5", "page": 4, "position": 1}

For a thorough understanding MD simulations at several temperatures might be necessary, for instance in the case of non-Arrhenius be- haviour, or to investigate the reliability of the results over a range of temperatures. Extract- ing the described information is beneﬁcial for understanding of the diﬀusion process, allowing for a targeted approach to design and prepare materials with enhanced properties, as will be demonstrated in this study for the Li-ion con- ductor β-Li3PS4. Example: β-Li3PS4 Li3PS4 has been a well-known Li-ion conductor since the 1980’s28, but interest grew after exper- iments with nano-sized crystals showed a Li-ion conductivity of 1.6 ∗10−4 S/cm29, approaching the value that is required for solid state Li-ion batteries. Three polymorphs of Li3PS4 have been reported30, the low-temperature γ-phase, the β-phase at intermediate temperatures, and the high temperature α-phase. The β-phase shows the highest room temperature conduc- tivity of the three polymorphs29, and is thus most interesting for application as a solid elec- trolyte. A beneﬁcial property of β-Li3PS4 is its apparent stability against Li-metal29, although DFT-calculations report otherwise6,31. Li3PS4 can be prepared via a solvent route32,33, result- ing in a conductivity of 3.3*10−4 S/cm32, en- abling coating of cathode materials. In this way no additional solid electrolyte material needs to be added in the cathodic mixture33, resulting in a larger eﬀective energy density in combination with a small interface resistance. Several studies28,30,34 investigating the struc- ture of β-Li3PS4 report signiﬁcantly diﬀerent Li-ion positions and occupancies. Neutron diﬀraction34 indicates that the coordinates of the Li-ion 4c position strongly depend on tem- perature, potentially explaining the diﬀerences between X-ray diﬀraction studies28,30. Based on the larger sensitivity to Li-ions of neu- trons compared to X-rays, the Li-positions de- termined from neutron diﬀraction34 at 413 K are used for the analysis of the present MD sim- ulations on β-Li3PS4.

To study the eﬀect of both Li-vacancies and Li-interstitials on the diﬀusion mechanism DFT MD simula- tions were performed for β-Li3PS4, β-Li2.75PS4, and β-Li3.25PS4 at 450, 600 and 750 K. Li-ion diﬀusion The diﬀusion paths from simulations at 600 K, shown in Figure 4, demonstrate that diﬀusion takes place along the b-axis via 4b-4c jumps, along the c-axis via 4b-8d and 4c-8d jumps, and through interplane 8d-8d jumps in the a- direction. In stoichiometric β-Li3PS4 relatively few transitions occur between the bc-planes, in- dicating that Li-ion diﬀusion occurs primarily within the bc-planes. When Li-vacancies or Li-interstitials are introduced the Li-ion diﬀu- sion within the bc-plane remains similar to the stoichiometric composition β-Li3PS4, while the amount of jumps between bc-planes increases signiﬁcantly, resulting in three-dimensional dif- fusion. The beneﬁcial eﬀect of the three-dimensional diﬀusion is reﬂected in the tracer diﬀusivity, shown in Figure 5. The Li-ion diﬀusivity in β-Li2.75PS4 is almost an order of magni- tude larger than in β-Li3PS4. Introducing Li- interstitials by creating β-Li3.25PS4 also results in a larger diﬀusivity, especially at the lowest simulated temperature. Based on the tracer diﬀusivity the conductivity of β-Li3PS4 is 10−2 S/cm at 450 K, comparable to impedance experiments32 at the same tem- perature. Extrapolating the Li-ion diﬀusivity of β-Li3PS4 to 110 ◦C results in a Li-ion diﬀusivity 6", "page": 5, "position": 1}

The results from the current MD simulations Figure 5: Tracer diﬀusivity from the current MD simulations, Phani et al.12 and Yang et al.38 on β-Li3PS4 are comparable to the values re- ported previously12,38, except at 450 K. This anomaly is most likely caused by the shorter simulation times of the previous studies, which can lead to an overestimation of the tracer dif- fusion at low temperatures. At 750 K all the MD simulations show a similar value for the dif- fusivity, which can be explained by the melted lithium sub-lattice12 at this temperature. After melting the lithium ordering over the diﬀerent crystallographic sites disappears, which seems to have a larger impact as the deviating stoi- chiometries investigated here. Jump rates The diﬀerences in tracer diﬀusivities between the three compositions can be explained by the rate-limiting jump mechanism. The most fre- quent jump process is the 4b-4c transition, the rate of which is comparable between the three compositions, as shown in Figure 6. However, to obtain three-dimensional diﬀusion paths in β-Li3PS4 interplane jumps are necessary, the rate of which is signiﬁcantly diﬀerent for the three compositions, also shown in Figure 6. 7", "page": 6, "position": 0}

Given this wide dis- tribution of values a comparison of experimen- tal activation energies with the present simula- tions seems unreasonable. Simulations also report a wide range of acti- vation energies.

Analysis of collective jumps in the present MD simulations reveals that the percentage of col- lective jumps depends on the temperature and Li-concentration, as shown in Figure 8. The percentage of collective jumps displays a strong increase with temperature, where 65 to 80 % of the jumps occur collectively at 750 K.

In Li3.25PS4 collec- tive 4b-4c and 4c-4b jumps also occur most frequently, additionally 4b-8d jumps collective with 4b-4c jumps occur, and interplane jumps are often collective with 4b-4c jumps. In the simulations of Li2.75PS4 diﬀerent collective be- haviour is observed, where the combination of 4b-8d jumps and 4b-4c jumps is occurring most frequently. Collective 4b-4c jumps also occur frequently, but signiﬁcantly less compared to the other compositions. Collective jumps involving more than two Li- ions also occur in the current MD simulations, in some cases involving up to 5 atoms. The collective movement of multiple atoms is com- plex and diﬃcult to analyse. However, it should be anticipated that collective motion of several ions induces large ionic conductivities, as ob- served in Li10GeP2S12 27, making this an inter- esting subject for further investigation. 9", "page": 8, "position": 1}

Attempt frequency The attempt frequencies obtained from the sim- ulations are shown in Figure 10a, in all simula- tions the attempt frequency is close to the typ- ically assumed 1013 Hz18,20. The present analy- sis shows that a straightforward Fourier trans- formation of the ionic velocity from a MD sim- ulation can be used to determine the attempt frequency. Figure 10a demonstrates that the attempt fre- quency decreases with increasing temperature, this decrease with increasing temperature can be understood by the change in the vibrational amplitude, shown in Figure 10b. For Li3.25PS4 and Li3PS4 the vibrational amplitude increases by approximately 35% between 450 and 750 K, while the speed of the atoms increases by just 29% (based on: E = 1 2mv2). The average vi- bration time therefore increases, leading to a decreasing attempt frequency. This example demonstrates that there can be a signiﬁcant temperature dependence on the at- tempt frequency, which may go unnoticed using the more regular static computational methods. Furthermore, the attempt frequency and vibra- (a) (b) Figure 10: (a) Attempt frequencies and (b) vi- bration amplitudes from the MD-simulations. 10", "page": 9, "position": 0}

Thereby the present simula- tions and analysis indicate that consideration of the attempt frequency and its dependence on structure and temperature is of signiﬁcant importance in quantifying and understanding ionic diﬀusion. Eﬀects of doping The MD simulations on β-Li3.25PS4 show that creating Li-interstitials in β-Li3PS4 induces three dimensional diﬀusion, increasing the macroscopic Li-ion conductivity, in line with experimental work35. Li-vacancies also induce three dimensional diﬀusion, and the MD simu- lations indicate signiﬁcantly larger Li-ion con- ductivity compared to the introduction of Li- interstitials. However, we are unaware of work which has explored the impact of Li-vacancies on Li-ion diﬀusion in β-Li3PS4. To deter- mine the impact of introducing Li-vacancies by doping MD simulations were performed on β-Li2.75PS3.75Br0.25, in which two S-atoms were replaced by Br-atoms. Additionally, the impact of oxygen doping is investigated, since this is also reported as a strategy to improve the Li-ion diﬀusivity36,42. However, O-doping does not change the Li- content, and the mechanism of higher Li-ion diﬀusivity by O-doping has not been revealed. To gain understanding of how oxygen doping increases the Li-ion diﬀusivity MD simulations on β-Li3PS3.75O0.25 were performed by replac- ing two S-atoms by O-atoms. Br-doping The jump diﬀusion path from the MD- simulation of β-Li2.75PS3.75Br0.25 is shown in Figure 11a. As should be anticipated from the simulations of β-Li2.75PS4, Figure 11a shows that Br-doping leads to three-dimensional dif- fusion paths. In β-Li2.75PS3.75Br0.25 the tracer diﬀusivity results in 1.56*10−6, 1.01*10−5, and 3.71*10−5 cm2/sec at 450, 600 and 750 K, re- spectively, comparable to the diﬀusivities of β-Li2.75PS4. The activation energies for dif- fusion along the b- and c-axis in the Br-doped composition at 600 K, shown in Figure 12, diﬀer by just 0.02 eV from the MD simulation with Li- vacancies. The activation energy for interplane jumps is 0.28 eV in both β-Li2.75PS3.75Br0.25 and β-Li2.75PS4. The similar activation energies in β-Li2.75PS4 and β-Li2.75PS3.75Br0.25 indicates that the pri- mary cause of the high", "page": 10, "position": 0}

The activation energies for dif- fusion along the b- and c-axis in the Br-doped composition at 600 K, shown in Figure 12, diﬀer by just 0.02 eV from the MD simulation with Li- vacancies. The activation energy for interplane jumps is 0.28 eV in both β-Li2.75PS3.75Br0.25 and β-Li2.75PS4. The similar activation energies in β-Li2.75PS4 and β-Li2.75PS3.75Br0.25 indicates that the pri- mary cause of the high Li-ion diﬀusivity in Br- doped β-Li3PS4 are the Li-vacancies. For other dopants which introduce Li-vacancies similar results are thus expected, suggesting that there are many ways of increasing the Li-ion diﬀusiv- ity in β-Li3PS4. O-doping The jump diﬀusion paths from the present MD- simulations on β-Li3PS3.75O0.25, shown in Fig- ure 11b, demonstrate that O-doping also in- duces three-dimensional diﬀusion, as predicted by Xiao et al.42. Compared to β-Li3PS4 doping with oxygen leads to a larger Li-ion diﬀusivity, and tracer diﬀusivities of 6.96*10−7, 7.59*10−6, and 2.52*10−5 cm2/sec at 450, 600 and 750 K, respectively. The introduction of oxygen re- sults in smaller activation energies compared to β-Li3PS4, as shown in Figure 12. The biggest impact is observed for the interplane jumps, which have an activation energy of just 0.32 eV in β-Li3PS3.75O0.25, comparable to the Li-rich β-Li3.25PS4. This is surprising because the introduction of oxygen does not aﬀect the Li-concentration. To investigate this the radial distribution functions (RDF’s) for oxygen and sulphur in β-Li3PS3.75O0.25 are shown in Figure 13. The smaller ionic radius of oxygen43 results in a smaller O-Li distance compared to the S-Li distance. However, the Li-density of the ﬁrst coordination shell in the RDF is signiﬁcantly lower around the O-atoms. Integrating the Li- density up to 3.5 ˚A shows that (on average) there are 2.9 Li-atoms in the ﬁrst coordination shell of O-atoms, and 3.5 Li-atoms in the ﬁrst coordination shell of S-atoms. This implies that it is unfavourable for Li-ions 11", "page": 10, "position": 1}

Oxygen-doping thus creates Li-vacancies near the O-atoms and Li-interstitials elsewhere, explaining why O-doping has a beneﬁcial eﬀect on Li-ion diﬀu- sivity in β-Li3PS4. It is usually assumed that a higher polarisabil- ity leads to higher diﬀusivity44 via lower activa- tion energies caused by lattice softening45. In the case β-Li3PS3.75O0.25 the higher diﬀusivity caused by O-atoms, which have lower polaris- ability compared to S-atoms, demonstrates that the opposite can also occur. The RDF’s shown in Figure 13 indicate that the site-energy near the O-atoms is higher, which, if the transitions state energy stays the same, lowers the acti- vation energy. In this case the less polarisable O-atoms are thus beneﬁcial for Li-ion diﬀusion. Figure 13: O-Li and S-Li distribution in β-Li3PS3.75O0.25 at 600 K. Conclusions The present approach demonstrates that from a single MD simulation key properties for ionic diﬀusion can be obtained, through which a thorough understanding of diﬀusion can be de- veloped. The example of DFT based MD simulations on β-Li3PS4 indicates that Li-ion jumps between bc-layers are the slowest jump process, limiting the macroscopic conductiv- ity. Adding Li-interstitials or Li-vacancies sig- niﬁcantly promotes these transitions, initiating three-dimensional diﬀusion, which enhances the Li-ion diﬀusivity. Li-vacancies can be intro- duced through Br-doping at the sulphur sites, which is predicted to result in an order of mag- nitude larger Li-ion conductivity in β-Li3PS4. Furthermore, it is shown that oxygen-doping at the sulphur site induces the formation of local interstitials, rationalizing the increased Li-ion diﬀusivity that has been reported. The thor- ough analysis of MD simulations presented is a general approach that can be applied to all crystalline ionic conductors, which can help to build understanding of diﬀusional processes in solid state electrolytes, and provide direction to the design of improved solid electrolyte materi- als.

The β-Li3PS4-phase crystallises in the orthorhom- bic space-group Pnma (no. 62), with lattice parameters of a = 12.82, b = 8.22, and c = 6.12 ˚A at 637 K30. The crystal structure as measured by Homma et al.30 was used as a starting point for the structure minimisations. To prevent self-interactions a 1x1x2 super cell was used in the calculations. After minimisa- tion without symmetry restrictions the lattice angles were close to 90◦in all cases, and the lat- tice parameters changed by less as 2%, with the a- and c-parameters showing a small increase, while the b-parameter decreased slightly. Dur- ing the minimisations a k-point mesh of 4x6x4 was used, which was reduced to a k-point mesh of 1x2x1 for the MD simulations. The total simulation time of the MD simulations was 500 ps., with 2 fs. time-steps. The ﬁrst 2.5 ps. were used as equilibration time and were thus not used for the analysis.
