Keywords two-dimensional material, negative Poisson’s ratio, magnetic semiconductor, water splitting, alkali ion migration 1 Introduction In recent years, two-dimensional (2D) materials with multi functionalities, such as those exhibiting negative Poisson’s ratio (NPR), magnetism, and electrocatalytic properties, have significantly expanded their application prospects in fields like flexible electronics, devices, and energy conversion. These advancements have made them a focal point of research. Among them, 2D NPR materials have gained increasing attention due to their potential applications in stress regulation and energy absorption.1 For instance, the inherent auxetic properties of MXene2 materials and δ-phosphorene3 endow them with significant application value in flexible electronics and optical devices. Magnetic 2D materials have also become a research focus due to their potential applications in spintronics. Materials such as CrI3 4 and Fe3GeTe2 5 exhibit stable ferromagnetism and hold promise for the development of spin valves and storage devices.6 Additionally, 2D materials have achieved remarkable progress in the field of catalysis, leveraging their high specific surface area, excellent conductivity, superior electronic transport properties, and rich surface chemical activity. For example, MoS2 7 exhibits high conductivity and chemical stability, with its nanosheet structure providing abundant active sites, thereby demonstrating excellent performance in both the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The discovery and development of new 2D materials, particularly multifunctional 2D materials, remain highly challenging research topics.

For example, researchers have discov- ered 2D materials with unique properties by employing element substitution and lattice engineering in various material systems, such as pentagonal 2D materials (e.g., penta-C,13 penta-SiC2 14), black phosphorus-like materials (e.g., black arsenic,15 SnSe16), and layered transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) resembling MoS2 (e.g., MX2 17). These strategies enable the optimization of material properties and the identification of novel materials with superior performance, advancing the development of functional 2D materials. In this study, we focus on a special 2D material, the V-shaped M4X8 (M = transition metal; X = halogen) Materials. As a typical example, research on bulk-phase PtI2 dates back to 1986,18 and PtI2 has attracted significant attention owing to its multifunctional proper- ties. Recently, Stoppiello et al. synthesized novel PtI2 and PtS2 nanostructures,19 further expanding their application potential. Furthermore, Shen et al. discovered that the mono- layer PtI2 exhibits excellent optical and catalytic properties,20 and it has a relatively low exfoliation energy, making it easier to isolate and thus more feasible for device applications. Based on these characteristics, we further explored derivatives of the V-shaped 2D material based on PtI2 through element substitution and high-throughput calculations, with the aim of discovering more functional 2D materials with potential applications. The choice of the V-shaped structure was partly based on chemical intuition, as such structures are believed to exhibit NPR properties, and the channels formed by the V-shaped structure may also facili- tate ion migration. Furthermore, particular attention was paid to their magnetic properties when designing these novel materials. Given the critical role of magnetic materials in stor- age, sensing, and spintronics applications, transition metal elements with potential magnetic characteristics were selected as candidates. For instance, elements such as nickel (Ni), known for their excellent magnetic properties, were included in the study. Given the outstanding 3", "page": 2, "position": 0}

The exchange-correlation interactions were described using the Perdew-Burke- Ernzerhof (PBE) functional within the generalized gradient approximation (GGA).25 A 500 eV energy cutoff was used, and a vacuum slab of over 20 ˚A was included to avoid spurious interactions between periodic images. The atomic positions and lattice constants were re- laxed using the conjugate gradient method. The convergence criterion for total energy was set to 10−5 eV, and the residual forces on each atom were converged to within 0.01 eV/˚A. We employed a 9×7×1 k-point mesh using the Monkhorst–Pack (MP)26 scheme to sample the Brillouin zone of the unit cell. Since the PBE functional underestimates the band gap of semiconductors, the Heyd–Scuseria–Ernzerhof (HSE06)27 hybrid functional was used for band gap correction. To qualitatively assess the structural stability, we examined the thermodynamic stability through cohesive energy calculations. The dynamical stability was evaluated using phonon dispersion calculations via the Phonopy code,28 based on the finite difference method implemented in VASP. Additionally, ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations were performed using a 3×3×1 monolayer supercell to assess thermal stability at 300 K for a simulation time of 5 ps with a time step of 1 fs. Finally, the elastic constants of the monolayer M4X8 were calculated using the mech2d29 software package to verify the mechanical stability and to analyze the Young’s modulus and Poisson’s ratio. Finally, the alkali ion diffusion barriers in monolayer M4X8 were estimated by using the climbing image 4", "page": 3, "position": 0}

Based on the PtI2 monolayer with P21/c (No.14) symmetry, we constructed 84 V-shaped corrugated monolayers by substituting Pt and I atoms with other elements of the periodic table. Figure 1(b) highlights the selected elements: M includes 21 transition metals (Sc-Zn, Y-Cd, and Pt), and X includes 4 halogens (F, Cl, Br, and I). Figure 1(c) illustrates the workflow of our high-throughput calculations. Among the 84 optimized M4X8 monolayers, 40 structures either lost their corrugated configuration or failed to maintain P21/c symmetry, indicating that these structures are unsuitable for the V-shaped corrugated configuration. We focus on the remaining 44 monolayers, whose optimized structures retain the initial symmetry and potentially exhibit NPR characteristics. To further determine the magnetic ground states of these 44 structures, we considered not only paramagnetic and ferromagnetic states but also three types of antiferromagnetic (AFM) states, with specific spin arrangements detailed in Supplementary Figure S1. The calculations reveal that even combinations of the same metal element with different halogens can exhibit distinct magnetic ground states. For instance, Cr4Cl8 adopts an AFM state, while Cr4Br8 and Cr4I8 exhibit ferromagnetic states. To evaluate the stability of the proposed materials, we firstly calculated the cohesive energy (Ecoh) of the M4X8 structures to assess their thermal stability. The cohesive energy is defined as: Ecoh = xEM + yEX −Etotal x + y (1) where EM, EX, and Etotal represent the energy of a single M atom, a single X atom, and the total energy of the M4X8 unit cell, respectively. The quantities x and y denote the number of M and X atoms in the unit cell. The results show that the cohesive energies of all 44 structures are positive, indicating that these V-shaped materials exhibit high thermodynamic stability and are likely to be synthesizable. We found that the cohesive energy of M4X8, formed by the same metal element and different halogens, decreases as the atomic number of the halogen increases. This may be attributed to the decrease in electro-negativity of the X atom, which enhances the ionic character of the metal-halogen bond and weakens its covalent", "page": 5, "position": 0}

The basic geometric parameters of these 44 structures, including lattice constants a and b, magnetic ground states, and cohesive energies, are summarized in Table S1 of the supplementary material. To further verify the stability of the M4X8 monolayers, we investigated their dynamic stability by calculating the phonon dispersion. Among the 44 structures, 22 were found to be dynamically stable (detailed results are provided in Figures S2 and S4). Notably, Ni4F8 and Ag4F8 exhibited minor negative frequencies near the Γ point (-0.095 and -0.081 THz, respectively), a phenomenon commonly observed in various two-dimensional materials, which does not compromise their dynamic stability. In contrast, the remaining 22 structures with significant negative frequencies were considered dynamically unstable. Subsequently, the thermal stability of the remaining 22 M4X8 monolayers was assessed via AIMD simula- tions. As shown in Figure S4, Ru4Br8, Rh4Cl8, Tc4Cl8, and Tc4Br8 underwent significant structural distortions at 300 K, indicating a lack of thermal stability. In contrast, the total energy fluctuations of the other 18 M4X8 monolayers remained below 3 eV (Figure S3), and their structures remained stable during the simulations, suggesting good thermal stability. Finally, the mechanical stability of these 18 thermally stable structures was analyzed using the Born criteria (C11C22 −C122 > 0 and C66 > 0),31 where Cij denotes the elastic constants. Excitingly, the stability assessments reveal that 18 V-shaped M4X8 monolayers exhibit ex- cellent thermodynamic, dynamic, thermal, and mechanical stabilities, indicating significant potential for experimental synthesis. 7", "page": 6, "position": 0}

Based on the above equations, we present the variation of Young’s modulus (Y ) and Poisson’s ratio (ν) with respect to angle (θ) in Figure 2(a) (taking Pd4I8 as an example). The results show that the monolayer Pd4I8 exhibits NPR characteristics, with a maximum Young’s modulus of 15 N/m and a minimum negative Poisson’s ratio of -0.798, occurring at θ = 42°. Table 1 lists the relevant parameters of the mechanical properties for 18 M4X8 monolayers, all of which exhibit relatively low in-plane Young’s modulus (less than 31 N/m) and significant anisotropy (see Figures S5 and S6). The highest in-plane Young’s modulus typically occurs along the x-axis, which is also the direction with the maximum positive Poisson’s ratio. The Young’s modulus of these materials is significantly lower than that of graphene (340 N/m)33 and MoS2 (330 N/m),34 indicating their promising potential for applications in flexible devices. Notably, 8 M4X8 monolayers exhibit NPR, with the lowest NPR values occurring in the direction between 34◦and 43◦, indicating their excellent mechanical properties such as dent resistance, high fracture toughness, and effective vibration or sound absorption capabilities. Specifically, the NPR values of Cu4Br8, Mo4Br8, and Ag4Br8 (-0.257, -0.068, and -0.151, respectively, as shown in Figure S6) are more negative than those of black phosphorus (- 0.027)35 and S-SiS2 (-0.054),36 suggesting that these V-shaped monolayers demonstrate more pronounced responses as auxetic materials. Additionally, the V-shaped buckling structures also exhibit out-of-plane NPR characteristics, including Ag4Br8, Cu4Cl8, Cu4Br8, Mo4Br8, Ni4Cl8, Pd4Br8, Pd4I8, Pt4Br8 and Pt4I8. As illustrated in Figure 2(b), the strain degree of the buckling height (εh) of the Pd4I8 structure increases with tensile strain applied along the x-direction (εx).

We observed that for M4X8 monolayers composed of the same metal atom but different halogen atoms, the band gap decreases as the atomic number of the halogen increases. The primary reason is probably differences in the atomic radii and electro-negativity of the halogen atoms, which result in variations in the bond lengths and charge distribution between the M and X atoms. Halogens with lower electronegativity (e.g., Iodine) exhibit weaker electron-attracting abilities, raising the energy of the valence band and consequently narrowing the band gap. Moreover, as shown in Table S1, for example, in the case of Ni4B8, the lattice constants a and b increase with the atomic number of the halogen. Larger lattice constants generally reduce the ionic character and bond strength of the metal-halogen bonds, resulting in lower transition energies for electrons between the valence and conduction bands, thereby decreasing the band gap.37,38 Through the analysis of band structures and PDOS calculated using the HSE06 functional (as shown in Figure 3 and Table S2), we identified four typical semiconductor types: param- agnetic semiconductors, antiferromagnetic semiconductors, half-semiconductors (HSC),39,40 and bipolar magnetic semiconductors (BMS),41–45 For all four categories, the valence band maximum (VBM) and conduction band minimum (CBM) are composed of contributions from the M and X atoms. Excitingly, among the ferromagnetic semiconductors, we identi- fied 2 HSCs (Cr4Br8 and Cr4I8) and 5 BMSs (Cu4F8, Cu4Cl8, Cu4Br8, Mo4Br8, and Mo4I8). HSCs exhibit semiconducting behavior in one spin channel and semiconducting or insulating behavior in the other. The valence band and conduction band of HSCs are spin-split, with the VBM and CBM having the same spin direction. Due to the complete spin polarization of the VBM and CBM, HSCs can generate 100% spin-polarized electrons and holes under thermal or optical excitation, or simply through electric gating. Similarly to HSCs, BMSs also allow for electrical control of the spin orientation of charge carriers, a crucial feature for developing high-performance spintronic devices. However, unlike HSCs, the VBM and CBM in BMSs are fully spin-polarized in opposite spin directions. This unique property", "page": 11, "position": 0}

For the adsorption of Li/Na/K atoms on the M4X8 monolayer, the Ead at the S2 site is the lowest, with values of -0.834 eV/atom for Li, -0.890 eV/atom for Na, and -1.440 eV/atom for K. Then the CI-NEB calculations are then used to estimate the diffusion barriers. As expected ( see in Figure 5(a)), when ions migrate along the grooves, the diffusion energy barriers are very small. For Li ions, the diffusion energy barrier is 0.11 eV, which is smaller than that value of green phosphorus (0.14 eV)47 and MoS2 (0.21 eV).48 For Na ions, the diffusion energy barrier is slightly lower than that of Li, decreasing to less than 0.10 eV, which is still lower than that of MoS2 (0.28 eV)49 and penta-graphene (0.28 eV).50 Additionally, the diffusion energy barrier for K ions is only 0.04 eV, which is much lower than that value of Si3C (0.18 eV),51 graphite (0.27 eV),52 and TiC3 (0.19 eV),53 and significantly lower than that of Li and Na ions. Moreover, as seen from the corresponding ion diffusion paths in Figure 5(b), the migration of the K ion on M4X8 has minimal impact on the material’s structure, demonstrating good structural stability, which is also true for Li and Na.

For the catalytic performance of HER, the descriptor is typically based on the Gibbs free energy of hydrogen adsorption (∆G). The closer ∆G is to 0, the better the material’s catalytic performance for HER. The change in Gibbs free energy, ∆G, is calculated using the method proposed by Nørskov et al., and is defined as follows:? ∆G = ∆E + ∆EZPE −T∆S + ∆GpH + ∆GU (8) Here, ∆E corresponds to the energy difference between the free state and the adsorbed state of the reaction intermediate obtained from DFT calculations; ∆EZPE is the zero-point energy change, where the zero-point energy is taken from vibrational frequency calculations; ∆S is the entropy change, which can be obtained from the NIST database. Room temperature (T = 298.15 K) is used in the calculation. The free energy correction for pH is given by ∆GPH = kBT × pH × ln10. ∆GU is calculated as ∆GU = -eU, where U is the electrode potential relative to the standard hydrogen electrode (SHE). 3", "page": 26, "position": 0}
