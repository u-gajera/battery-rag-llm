Using density functional theory (DFT), a systematic computational screening of 18 NZP compounds, namely LiX2(LO4)3 with X = Ti, V, Fe, Zr, Nb, Ru, Hf, Ta, Os, and L = P, Mn is performed with respect to their activation energies for vacancy-mediated Li migration. It is shown how the diﬀerent ionic radii of the cationic substitutions inﬂuence structural characteristics such as the octahedron volumes around Li ions on the initial and transition state sites, which aﬀect the activation energies (”composition-structure-property” rela- tionships). The prevalent assumption that structural bottlenecks formed by triangularly arranged oxygen atoms at a certain location along the migration path determine the energy barriers for Li migration is not supported by the DFT results. Instead, the ionic neighborhood of the migrating ion in the initial and in the transition state needs to be taken into account to relate the structure to the activation energies. This conclusion applies to Na containing NZP compounds as well. 1 arXiv:1901.09759v1 [cond-mat.mtrl-sci] 28 Jan 2019", "page": 0, "position": 0}

INTRODUCTION A major challenge in the development of future portable energy storage devices with the potential to outreach today’s battery technology in terms of capacity, energy density, charge rate, cyclability, and safety, is the identiﬁcation of new materials for the use as anodes, cathodes, or electrolytes with improved properties such as ionic conductivity or thermal, chemical, electrochemical, and mechanical stability [1]. A popular approach in the search for new materials taking advantage of today’s available computational resources is the virtual screening and characterization of hundreds of compounds which are systematically generated by substituting elements at speciﬁc lattice sites of a material class, with the goal of identifying compositions leading to improved battery-relevant properties [2, 3]. Apart from eventually predicting promising new materials, the data produced by such a combi- natorial high-throughput screening (HTS) can be used to detect relationships between the composition, structure, and property of interest, which help to understand the underlying mechanisms better, and therefore may open up promising directions for optimization [4, 5]. Present state-of-the-art battery technology could be improved signiﬁcantly by replacing the liquid electrolyte by a highly ion-conducting and electrochemically stable solid-state electrolyte (SSE). Batteries consisting of SSEs could be stacked more densely, and safety concerns such as temperature stability, ﬂammability and leakage of toxic liquids would be overcome [6, 7]. However, currently known SSE materials don’t yet reach the ionic con- ductivity of liquid electrolytes, and therefore they lead to lower power densities and slower charge/discharge rates [8]. Fast and reversible migration of the charge carrying ions is not only relevant for SSEs, but also for solid intercalation electrode materials when the battery is operating in the ”rocking chair” mode, where the ions are repeatedly inserted into and extracted out of the cathodes or anodes [9, 10]. The material class with the crystal structure of NaZr2(PO4)3 (NZP), also named NA- SICON after the Na Super Ionic Conductor Na1+xZr2SixP3−xO12 (0 ≤x ≤3) [11], has been widely examined due to its structural framework exhibiting a 3-dimensional network of paths for ionic migration [12, 13].

On the one hand, the rhombohedral NZP structure with space group R¯3c is known to be stable under a variety of diﬀerent occupations of the cationic sublattices [20–23]; on the other hand, these occupations strongly inﬂuence the ionic conductivity [24– 28]. The latter is assumed to originate from diﬀerently sized bottlenecks along the migration paths of the mobile ionic species (e.g. Li), inﬂuenced by diﬀerently sized oxygen polyhedra around larger or smaller cations [29–32]. For the NZP-type compound LiTi2(PO4)3 (LTP), it was shown by atomistic calculations that partial substitution of Ti by iso- or aliovalent cations changes the activation energy of vacancy-mediated Li migration due to diﬀerent volumes of the oxygen octahedra around the Li atoms [33]. In this work, a variety of NZP-type compounds of the form LiX2(LO4)3 containing a sys- tematic set of nine diﬀerent metal ions on the X site, and either P or Mn on the L site is ex- amined with respect to the conductivity of Li ions. The energy barriers for vacancy-mediated migration processes are calculated by means of density functional theory and nudged elastic band methods [34]. The prevalent expectation of the bottleneck in the migration path of NZP-type compounds crystallizing in the R¯3c structure is critically addressed. Relationships between the constituent elements, the local arrangement of ions, and the activation energies are discussed. The paper is organized as follows: in Sec. II, the details of the NZP structure are described, the computational methods are introduced, and the choice of elements and compounds for this study is motivated. A discussion of the coordination of the so-called M2 site, for which the observations reported in the literature are ambiguous, is given in Sec. III A. Minimum energy paths for vacancy-mediated migration of Li ions are presented in Sec. III B and discussed with regard to the bottleneck concept by comparing experimental and computational results.

III C, the dependence of activation energies of the migra- tion process on the volumes of oxygen octahedra around the initial and ﬁnal Li positions is investigated and a simple model is presented to explain the", "page": 2, "position": 0}

The NZP Structure NaZr2(PO4)3, the prototype of the material class NZP with the general chemical formula MnX2(LO4)3 (n = 1, 2, 3, 4), crystallizes in the trigonal crystal system with space group R¯3c. The M sites are occupied by monovalent cations such as Na+, Li+, or Cu+ representing the mobile ionic species. Higher valent cations on the X positions (e.g. Al3+, Ti4+) and on the L positions (e.g. Si4+, P5+) build up the structural framework, the latter forming anionic groups (e.g. [SiO4]4−, [PO4]3−) with oxygen. The crystal structure belongs to the rhombohe- dral lattice system, but is generally represented with hexagonal lattice vectors. Fig. 1 shows the hexagonal cell containing six formula units of the NZP compound LiTi2(PO4)3, i.e. 108 atoms. The structure is built up by so-called lanterns consisting of two oxygen octahedra around the X (here Ti) atoms (Wyckoﬀposition 12c), and three oxygen tetrahedra around the L (here P) atoms (18e). There are two oxygen atoms in the asymmetric unit on Wyckoﬀ positions 36f which form one substructure of triangular prisms building the cores of the lantern units, and a second substructure of octahedra being located above and below the lantern units in [0001] direction. The centers of these octahedra (6b) are called M1 sites, and they are occupied by M (here Li) atoms. Since the volume of an oxygen prism is only about 60% of the M1 volume, the centers of the prisms (6a) remain unoccupied. In case of an occupation of lower valent cations on X or L sites, the amount of M atoms is increased in order to fulﬁll the condition of charge neutrality. These additional M atoms are occupying so-called M2 positions (18e) in between two neighboring M1 sites. The oxygen coordination of M2 is ambiguously reported in the literature; this will be discussed in detail in section III A. Another interstitial position for M atoms is the M12 site (also labeled M3 in some references [19, 35]) on the general Wyckoﬀposition 36f, which is located in between neighboring M1 and M2 sites, i.e. within the distorted tetrahedra conﬁned by", "page": 3, "position": 0}

The initial state (LiM1 −VacM2 −VacM1) and transition state (VacM1 −LiM2 −VacM1) conﬁgurations of this process will be labeled by I and T , respectively, in the following.

Choice of Compounds In a previous study, a computational high-throughput screening of 450 NZP compounds of the form LiX2(LO4)3 with a variety of diﬀerent elements on the X and L positions was conducted by the authors of the present work with the intention to identify new thermally stable NZP materials [38]. In detail, a systematic multi-step approach of combined molecular dynamics simulations for temperatures up to 800 K, the application of a stability criterion from the bond valence theory [39], and structural relaxation by DFT, where at each step all structures deviating from the rhombohedral NZP-type structure were sorted out, ﬁnally lead to a collection of compounds with a variety of metallic elements on the X position, and mostly P, Cr and Mn on the L position. Within this approach, all these compounds therefore are stable in the NZP structure even up to higher temperatures, at least in a local energy minimum. For the present study, compounds with the 3d transition metal elements Ti, V, Fe, the 4d elements Zr, Nb, Ru, and the 5d elements Hf, Ta, and Os on the X position were taken into account, allowing for a systematic analysis across the periods 4, 5, and 6, and the groups 4, 5, and 8 of the periodic table. In order to analyze the inﬂuence of diﬀerent L-site atoms, P and Mn were considered, leading to 18 compounds altogether.

Methods of Computation Density functional theory (DFT) as implemented in the PWscf code of the open-source software Quantum Espresso [43] was applied to calculate the total energies of the NZP-type crystals, to relax the structures by means of a BFGS algorithm [44], and to determine acti- vation energies of the Li migration process. Corresponding energy barriers were obtained by applying the nudged elastic band method (NEB) [34]. The general gradient approximation of Perdew et al. (PBE) [45] was used for exchange-correlation. The Brillouin zone inte- grations in reciprocal space were carried out on a 3 × 3 × 1 Monkhorst-Pack k-point mesh [46] with a Gaussian smearing of the partial orbital occupancies with a width of 0.01 Ry. The interaction of valence electrons with core electrons and atomic nuclei were taken into account by ultrasoft pseudo potentials provided by the GBRV library [47, 48]. Wavefunc- tions of the valence electrons were expanded in a basis set of plane waves up to an energy cutoﬀof 35 Ry. To model the NZP compounds, a hexagonal cell consisting of 108 atoms (six NZP formula units) in the defect-free crystal structure was used as depicted in Fig. 1. Each defect-free system was initially relaxed, i.e. the atomic positions were optimized until the minimal force component acting on an atom was lower than 0.002 Ry/˚A, and the volume was relaxed by minimizing the total energy and the internal stress. From these optimized cells of the perfect crystals, systems containing Li vacancies or interstitials were generated by extracting or inserting the atoms at the positions of interest, followed, unless otherwise stated, by only ionic relaxation at ﬁxed cell volume with the same convergence criteria. Note that this workﬂow follows the same procedure as described in Ref. [33]. III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION A. Coordination of the M2 Site The M2 site in NZP-type compounds crystallizing in the space group R¯3c has been reported to be coordinated by 14 [26], 10 [33], 8 [24, 49], 6 [36], or 4 [15] oxygen atoms.

Exemplarily for LiTi2(PO4)3 with Li occupying the M1 sites, an additional Li atom was placed on a M2 site with a varying value of x between 0.25 and 0.45. The analysis of the neighbor environment yielded that for x values between 0.33 and 0.41, which covers almost the full range of experimentally measured data, the 6 closest neighboring atoms are oxygen atoms forming a distorted octahedron (see Fig. 2). Calculated total energy diﬀerences (without structural relaxation) further indicated that such a conﬁguration is energetically favored. The total oxygen coordination, as deﬁned by the maximum sized polyhedron which contains no other atom inside, takes values between 14 and 12 in the range of experimental x values. The 12-cornered polyhedron is indicated by the red colored oxygen atoms in the inset of Fig. 2. Since some of these oxygen atoms are at rather long distances, up to about 4 ˚A from the M2 site, which is considerably longer than some of the distances to atoms of the other types (here Li, Ti, and P), these oxygen atoms presumably weren’t counted to the number of coordinating atoms in the papers referenced above stating lower coordinations. B. Energy Barriers for Li Migration M-site ions in NZP-type structures are known to migrate along the interconnected network of M1, M12, and M2 sites. In order to determine the energies corresponding to a Li ion moving from a M1 site via M2 to a neighboring vacant M1 site, the initial-state [(I), see section II A] and transition-state (T ) conﬁgurations were set up and structurally relaxed for all the 18 compounds considered in this study. Since the conﬁgurations correspond to either a local energy minimum (I) or to a saddle point (T ), these relaxations did not lead to major atomic rearrangements except for an increase of the octahedron volumes around the vacant M1 sites between 8% and 36% compared to the perfect crystals. The volumes of the octahedra around all of the other still occupied M1 sites changed only negligibly, which further indicates the stability of the", "page": 6, "position": 0}

Note that due to the mirror symmetry of the energy proﬁles along the paths LiM1 →LiM2 and LiM2 →LiM1, it is suﬃcient to treat only one of these two sections explicitly. Vacancy-mediated ionic migration of Na and Li ions in NZP-type compounds and the corresponding activation energies have been considered to be characterized by a bottleneck deﬁned by the triangular faces of the oxygen coordinated M1 octahedra across which the ions have to move to reach the M2 sites [30–32]. In this picture, one would expect at least one energy maximum along the M1→M2 migration path, and eventually a second one when the moving atom crosses the face of the M2 coordinating octahedron. However, the evaluation of the minimum-energy paths before and after the NEB calculation, as shown in Fig. 3 for all the compounds, indicates, that there is only one distinct maximum corresponding to the central image of the initial path. This maximum considerably drops during the NEB calculation and ends up even below the energy of the transition-state conﬁguration with Li on the M2 site. Since the energy curves are qualitatively similar except for variations in the barrier heights for all of the considered elemental substitutions, the behavior can be regarded as generally valid for NZP-type compounds with R¯3c symmetry. As can be seen in the inset of Fig. 3, the origin of the energy maximum is the relatively short distance of a Li ion to two oxygen ions at the center of the initial path (i.e. half way between M1 and M2), as well as the asymmetric location of this atom in the tetrahedral oxygen environment. Relaxation cures this unfavored conﬁguration by shifting the Li ion much closer to the geometric center of the tetrahedron of the oxygen ions. Since these positions are indeed the M12 sites which are known to be occupied in several NZP compounds, a low energy could be expected. However, they don’t appear as energy minima along the paths, since in stable conﬁgurations, M12 positions are", "page": 7, "position": 0}

The curves corresponding to Mn on L positions show considerably higher energies than the curves for P on L positions. This is more pronounced for the unrelaxed paths, but still valid after the relaxation for most of the curves. The activation energy Ea as deﬁned in Sec. II A for the vacancy-mediated migration of Li is obtained from the maximum value of the relaxed paths depicted in Fig. 3. Since none of the relaxed paths exhibits any further maximum, the prevalent concept of a migration bottleneck between the M1 and M2 sites needs to be critically reassessed. The bottleneck concept in NZP structures was ﬁrst described in detail by Kohler and Schulz for the NASICON compounds Na1+zZr2-ySixP3-xO12 [29, 30]. Using X-ray diﬀraction at elevated temperatures, where the compounds were in the rhombohedral NZP structure, probability density functions (PDFs) of Na ions within the lattice were obtained from mea- sured anharmonic temperature coeﬃcients of the Na site. Close to the center between two maxima corresponding to the M1 and M2 positions, a minimum of the PDFs was obtained and interpreted as the bottleneck for Na migration by linking the PDFs to an eﬀective potential with a maximum at the bottleneck position. As reported above, no such maximum appeared in the calculated NEB migration paths of the Li-containing NZP-type compounds. But since the radius of a Na+ ion is by 34 % (for a 6-fold coordination) to 68 % (for a 4-fold coordination) larger than the radius of a Li+ ion, one may assume distinct bottleneck-related maxima along the migration paths of Na in Na-containing NZP-type structures. Fig. 4 displays the paths for Na migration in NaTi2(PO4)3 and NaZr2(PO4)3 in comparison to those of Li migration in LiTi2(PO4)3 and LiZr2(PO4)3, all curves obtained in the same way as described in Sec. II C. The ﬂat region around the local minimum at the M2 position is more pronounced in the Na than in the Li compounds. But again, no pronounced maxima are found in the energy curves, which could", "page": 8, "position": 0}

In analyzing the average distances of Li/Na to the three closest oxygen atoms (Fig. 5) and setting them in relation to the energy barriers (Fig. 4), no obvious correlation between the shape of the energy barriers and the atomic distances between Li or Na and O can be identiﬁed. Rather, the stable positions of Li or Na at the M1 and M2 positions can be linked to larger atomic distances as compared to lower atomic distances at the unstable intermediate path positions. Since at the intermediate positions, Na or Li ions are unlikely to be found, this could explain the above mentioned minima in the PDFs reported by Kohler and Schulz [29, 30]. Results of DFT NEB calculations performed for various NZP-type compounds by Lang et al. ([33]), Shi et al. ([52]), and Lu et al. ([53]) do not show bottleneck-related energy maxima along Li or Na migration path either, but pronounced maxima at or close to the M2 position. Shi et al. report smaller energy barrier heights for larger values of the average bond length between Li or Na and the eight closest oxygen neighbors around M2, which can be related to a correlation of lowered activation energies with increasing volumes of the M2-coordination polyhedron. This will be discussed in Sec. III C. Not just the closest three oxygen atoms determine the energy of Li or Na atoms along the migration path, but the extended coordination environment has to be taken into account. This is also discussed by Lu et al., who considered in addition to the M1-M2 path some further migration directions for Li/Na in the rhombohedral NZP structure, leading to remarkably diﬀerent (higher) activation energies while retaining very similar areas of the oxygen triangles across which Li or Na atoms have to migrate. It is interesting to note that studies of NZP compounds using classical atomistic simula- tion methods such as a rigid-ion Coulomb-Buckingham pair potential [54] or bond-valence (BV) analysis [55, 56] report energy maxima along the ionic transition paths.

The lack of a self-consistent electronic screening of the migrating ion in the rigid-ion pair potential models presumably is the reason for the diﬀering results when using classical simulation methods instead of DFT. C. Activation Energies In the bottleneck concept, a clear correlation between the volumes VM1 of oxygen octahe- dra around Li on a M1 position and the activation energies of ionic migration is expected. In the upper panel of Fig. 6, the activation energies Ea for the compounds LiX2(PO4)3 (LXP) are shown versus the volumes VM1 in conﬁguration (I) and versus the volumes VM2 in conﬁg- uration (T ). The regression lines indicate that there is indeed a trend of decreasing energy barriers with larger octahedron volumes, but the correlations are scarce, especially for the M2 volumes. Since the activation energies are calculated by the energy diﬀerence of the two terminating states at M1 and M2, a quantity taking into account characteristics of both con- ﬁgurations (I) and (T ) should rather correlate with Ea. Indeed, a clearly better correlation can be obtained between Ea and the diﬀerence in octahedron volumes ∆V = VM1 −VM2 (see Fig. 6, lower panel). In order to understand the structural inﬂuence of changing octahedron volumes on Ea irrespective of the chemical inﬂuences of diﬀerent atomic species, we studied the eﬀect of an isotropic volume variation on the compound LiTi2(PO4)3. The lattice constants a and c of the hexagonal cell were varied stepwise while keeping the c/a ratio constant at its equilibrium value. At each volume step, conﬁgurations (I) and (T ) were set up, and the internal coordinates were relaxed. It is found that the activation energies decrease with increasing octahedron volumes around Li on both M1 and M2 positions as depicted in Fig. 6 (central panel). The slopes of these curves diﬀer from those of the regression lines through the values of all the LXP compounds (upper panel), but the dependence of Ea on ∆V from the isotropic volume variation almost perfectly matches the line of Ea versus ∆V through the LXP values", "page": 10, "position": 0}

The slopes of the regression lines for L=P (−0.27 eV/˚A 3) and L=Mn compounds (−0.24 eV/˚A 3) diﬀer by only 0.03 eV/˚A 3. This indicates that there is only a little range for the slope values of these curves, only deﬁned by the underlying NZP crystal structure and the type of the migrating atom. However, the line for L=P and L=Mn have diﬀerent y-axis intercepts, i.e. LXP and LXM compounds cannot be represented by a single line of Ea versus ∆V . This is because of the larger ionic radius of Mn+5 compared to P+5, leading to considerably lower LiO6 volume diﬀerences between M1 and M2 octahedra for LXM than for LXP compounds. This will be discussed in more detail in Sec. III D. The strongest deviations from the regression lines are obtained for LiTa2(PO4)3 (42 meV), LiRu2(MnO4)3 (54 meV), LiTa2(MnO4)3 (40 meV), and LiNb2(MnO4)3 (54 meV). As stated in Sec. II B, the DFT approach predicts all the compounds considered in this study to be stable in the NZP-type structure in at least a local energy minimum. But if such an energy minimum is shallow, lattice imperfections such as Li vacancies can cause slight distortions of the LiO6-octahedra in the vicinity. This may be a reason for the deviations of the points Ea (∆V ) found for some of the compounds of up to about 50 meV from the regression lines, which corresponds to a deviation of the volume diﬀerence of about 0.25 ˚A 3. In order to understand the decreasing Ea with increasing ∆V when the volume is isotrop- ically varied, we consider the dependence of the total energies EI and ET , which deﬁne the activation energy, on a change of the total cell volume Vc [see Fig. 8 for LiTi2(PO4)3].

Both curves follow an equation of state, which can be approximated by a parabolic function around their respective minima. When Li sits on the M1 site, i.e., on its energetically most stable position in the center of a regular octahedron, the bonds to the surrounding oxygen atoms are stronger than for Li on the less favorable M2 site within a more distorted octahedron. Therefore, the curvature of the EI (Vc) parabola is larger than that of the ET (Vc) parabola, which corresponds to a higher bulk modulus of the initial compared to the transition state. Furthermore, the less strongly bound Li on M2 together with the expansion of the two adjacent empty M1 octahedra results in a larger equilibrium cell volume in the transition state. In combination, these two eﬀects lead to a decreasing energy diﬀerence with increasing cell volume in the region around the equilibrium.

Under these conditions, ∆g (x) has a maximum in the negative x-range, and therefore decreases monotonically in the region around the minima of g1 and g2 at x = 0 and x = δ, respectively. Furthermore, from the crystal structure (Fig. 1) it follows, that an isotropic change in the lattice parameters (or cell volume) has a larger inﬂuence on the size of the oxygen octahedra around M1 than on the size of the octahedra around M2. This can be derived formally, but also understood intuitively, since the octahedra around M1 are elongated in the [0001] direction of the hexagonal cell, while the octahedra around M2 are inclined relative to this axis. Altogether, increasing the cell volume results in a raising diﬀerence between the octahedron volumes around M1 and M2, and in a lowering of the activation energy, which explains the observed good correlation of Ea and ∆V . D. Inﬂuence of Composition It is intuitively obvious that the migration capability of atoms along pathways within a deﬁned crystal structure must somehow be related to the interatomic distances in the structure, being deﬁned by its lattice parameters. These in turn are inﬂuenced by the ionic radii of the constituent atoms. Since NZP compounds remain structurally stable for a wide variety of diﬀerent elements on the cationic sites, a dependence of ionic conductivity on com- position and lattice dimensions can directly be studied by analyzing the eﬀect of elemental substitutions on the activation energies. Such correlations were experimentally reported for Na [21, 24, 25, 31] as well as for Li [22, 27, 28, 32] containing NZP compounds. For example, Losilla et al. [31] reported increasing lattice parameters and decreasing activation energies when In+3 in Na3In2(PO4)3 was partially substituted by Ti+4, Sn+4, Hf+4, and Zr+4 (in this order), having ionic radii rion of 0.61 ˚A, 0.69 ˚A, 0.71", "page": 12, "position": 0}

However, in a six-fold oxygen coordination Fe is hardly found in the charge state +4 but rather in the state +3, as in Fe2O3 or Fe3O4. Furthermore, synthesized iron-containing NZP compounds are reported to contain more than one Li atom per formula unit, which is related to the charge state of Fe being +3 rather than +4 in these compounds [59, 60]. The ionic radius of Fe+3 in the low spin state (”ls” in Fig. 9) better ﬁts to the correlation with the cell volume. On the other hand, when extrapolating both low-spin and high-spin Shannon radii for the charge states +2 and +3 to +4, one ends up at a value of 0.5 ˚A. Following the trend of the cell volumes across the periodic table, the rion of iron in both of the calculated compounds LiFe2(PO4)3 and LiFe2(MnO4)3 can be assumed to range between that value and the low spin value of Fe+3 (0.55 ˚A). With decreasing total cell volume, the volumes VM1 and VM2 decrease, too (see central panel of Fig. 9). Since this aﬀects VM1 more strongly than VM2, their diﬀerence ∆V drops for shrinking cell volumes, in agreement with the discussion for the isotropic volume change of a single compound (see Sec. III C and Fig. 8). Only the compound LiTi2(MnO4)3 exhibits a small deviation from this behavior. The ionic radius of Mn+5 (0.33 ˚A) is about twice as large as that of P+5 (0.16 ˚A), which is reﬂected by larger total cell volumes. But the volumes VM1 are considerably smaller in the LXM than in the LXP compounds. Compared to the X-O6 conﬁgurations, where four electrons from the X atom contribute to the bonds, the LiM1-O6 octahedra with just one shared valence electron from the Li", "page": 13, "position": 0}

Compared to the X-O6 conﬁgurations, where four electrons from the X atom contribute to the bonds, the LiM1-O6 octahedra with just one shared valence electron from the Li atom are less stiﬀunder compression. An increasing size of L-O4 tetrahedra will therefore push the stiﬀcorner-connected X-O6 octahedra away from each other while compressing the LiM1-O6 octahedra of the same lantern unit in [0001] direction (see Fig. 1). Due to the face-connection of the LiM1-O6 to the stiﬀX-O6 octahedra, the former won’t be expanded in a direction perpendicular to [0001] by an increase of the ionic radius of the L-site atom. The whole lantern units will rather be pushed away from each other in [10¯10] and [01¯10] directions, leading to an increase of the corresponding lattice parameter (a). Since the expansion of the lattice parameter c is almost compensated by the considerable shrinkage of the LiM1-O6 octahedra in [0001]-direction, the average c/a ratio over the considered compounds drops from 2.41 for LXP to 2.34 for LXM.

But due to counteracting eﬀects in neighboring lantern units and the face-connection to two stiﬀX-O6 octahedra, the volume changes are less pronounced, resulting in lower volume diﬀerences between LiM2-O6 and LiM1-O6 octahedra for larger ions on the L positions. This observation for the inﬂuence of the L+5-ions, and the systematic decrease of cell and Li-octahedron volumes as well as of volume diﬀerences for shrinking ionic radii of the X+4 ions from left to right along periods of the periodic table of elements, together with the corre- lation of octahedron volume diﬀerences and vacancy migration energies of Li ions discussed above, constitute a useful composition-structure-property relationship for rhombohedrally crystallizing NZP-type compounds. IV. CONCLUSIONS Using density functional theory and nudged elastic band calculations, the migration paths and activation energies for vacancy-mediated hopping of Li ions were determined in a sys- tematic set of 18 NZP-type compounds LiX2(LO4)3 with X = Ti, V, Fe, Zr, Nb, Ru, Hf, Ta, Os, and L = P, Mn. In the rhombohedral NZP structure, which from a previous study is known to be stable for all the considered compounds, vacancy-mediated Li migration can take place between M1 and M2 sites. The energy barriers show qualitatively similar behavior for the diﬀerent cationic occupations with an energy minimum for Li occupying the M1 site and a maximum for Li at M2, but lacking any further intermediate maximum. The existence of such an intermediate maximum is prevalently assumed to originate from a close trian- gular oxygen arrangement (”bottleneck”) around Li when it crosses the face of the oxygen octahedron surrounding the M1 site. This concept was surveyed more deeply for selected Li and Na containing NZP compounds. It was found that along the M1-M2 migration path, there is no distinct energy minimum at the closest distances of the migrating Li or Na ion to the oxygen ions which could be related to a structural bottleneck with a corresponding maximum in the energy barrier. Instead, the activation energy results obtained from the energy diﬀerence between Li on the M2 and M1 positions,", "page": 14, "position": 0}

This linear correlation is reproduced when considering an isotropic volume variation in each one of the P and Mn compounds, which could be traced back to slight diﬀerences in the parabolic energy curves of a system in the initial (or ﬁnal) state (Li on M1) and in the transition state (Li on M2). From left to right along a period in the periodic table, the ionic radius of the X+4 cation decreases, and so do the NZP cell volumes, the volumes of M1 and M2 octahedra, and also mainly each of the octahedron volume diﬀerences, which links the composition to the structure in terms of local atomic environments of the migrating ion, and to the activation energy.
