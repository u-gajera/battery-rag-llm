Introduction The Li-ion Batteries (LIBs) are the most advanced technologies for electrochemical storage and conversion and undergoing a market expansion with respect to the increase of the electrical vehicles sales and appearance of a panoply of mobile applications. Although extensive studies have been undertaken in order to increase the energy density and power in LIBs, however, the achieved energy storage capability so far is still not adequate to meet the continuous demand from the growing markets, and keep up with challenges for building “sustainable” batteries in terms of performance/energy density as well as cost-efficiency and safety. In actual fact, LIBs suffer from the rare abundance of Li metal, and the apparent decrease of the price of LIBs in general, owing to mass production, does not justify the diminution of the overall resources involved in LIB components and processes. For more than a quarter century of commercialization, LIBs have been embraced as high energy density and long-cycle-life technology, and consequently dominated portable electronics and rechargeable battery systems for the emerging electric/hybrid vehicles. Even though this technology is considered as a possible choice for future electric vehicles and grid- scale energy storage systems; one must admit, insufficiency on a global scale of lithium resources and safety factors will strongly limit its further use in large-scale applications [1]. It is predicted, indeed, that the possibility of lithium supply will run out on long term basis (Fig. 1a), depending on the forthcoming political decisions for large-scale energy storage. Although there are opportunities of cost-effective recycling and exploring new sources, however, the gap between offer and demand could result in price significant fluctuations [2]. In the near future, market forecast of rechargeable batteries predict large-scale battery markets with electric vehicles (xEVs) and energy storage systems (ESSs) for smart grids with the matching of the volumes of the produced renewable energies (Fig. 1b). One can expect, if not already felt, that the market is moving from the small-scale to large-capacity industry sector. Fig. 1b shows the rapid growth phase and market expansion which is governed by the emerging applications. The mobile device sector of", "page": 1, "position": 0}

To overcome the lack of reliable energy storage and conversion, and revolutionize the transport and electricity-grid, novel electrochemical storage technologies beyond Li-ion batteries are highly required. Electrochemical energy storage systems and technologies are in continuous development owing to the worldwide demand to overcome the current energy issues and satisfy the daily needs in which rechargeable batteries play a key role [5]. Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) and potassium-ion batteries (KIBs) are the most evident alternatives to LIBs since these technologies are using relatively abundant and cheap sodium (potassium) elements and they have similar chemical properties to lithium, though they have been pointed out regarding their low energy density, and use of highly toxic and flammable electrolytes, as well as having rather high operating costs at their early stage of development [6]. The SIB is a complex cell when in operation compared to LIBs. Such batteries need to be explored and studied in the aim to establish alternative battery chemistries with low-cost, high safety and long cycle life. Here, we will review the recent battery developments beyond classical LIBs, taking in consideration electrode materials and electrolytes for cationic shuttles (Na, Mg, Ca, Zn and Al), as well as anionic shuttles such as halides. An overview of the state-of-the-art of MH-based batteries will be also presented, including NiMH batteries, and metal hydrides accommodated LIBs. Furthermore, we will discuss the scientific challenges of the most relevant battery technologies, and how this will affect our perception of future batteries according to the specificity of the application. Finally, we will summarize the outcome of this review work in the conclusion part and provide new perspectives for possible battery research directions. Figure 1.

Motivation and current development On the first plan, Na-ion batteries are presented as alternative to Li-ion technology owing to cost- efficiency, safety and long-term sustainability. The abundance of Na compared to Li makes the cost factor decisive for the choose between the two technologies [2]. In addition, Al current collector can be used with Na instead of Cu with higher costs, and no alloying between Al-Na takes place. Na-ion batteries are considered safer with less thermal runaway [8]. By comparing to LIB, sodium-ion battery has similar chemistry during the (de)insertion; it is believed that concept, manufacturing and end- products commercialization processes can be adapted to the existing ones for Li-ion technology. However, the Na-ion battery system counts a few drawbacks which hinder its quick development as alternative to Li-ion battery [1]. Due to the higher atomic size and larger specific weight of Na, the theoretical capacities of the metal and of the electrode materials are lower, as well as the corresponding energy densities [9]. The anode consists usually of hard carbon, as the graphite can not allow the intercalation of Na+ ions between the carbon layers. The most common electrolytes allowing transport of Na+ ions are based on either carbonate-based solvents or ionic liquids. A large number of potential cathode materials have been explored in the last years, consisting of structurally stable polyanionic materials and layered transition metal oxides such as NaTMO2 providing high energy density and high operating voltages [10]. The cathode material Na(Ni0.5Mn0.5)O2 has the specific capacity of 125 mAh.g-1 (2.2-3.8 V) and high rate capability [11]. Nevertheless, the long term cycling stability is still a challenge for the layered oxides owing to the large structural changes caused by the volume expansion/contraction during Na+ (de)intercalation. For quick development, the Sodium-ion batteries face the challenge to improve the specific capacity and reaching higher working voltages. This technology seems to follow the same trend as for Li-ion one regarding major challenges, i.e. most research efforts are first put on the study of the cathode structure, as well as cycle life,", "page": 3, "position": 0}

For instance, Na-ion batteries at their initial development are more likely to fit in the stationary storage of energy endeavoring to become a commercial product at larger scale. 2.1.2. State-of-the art of Na-ion batteries 2.1.2.1. Cathode materials Metal oxide cathode materials are the most developed and promising cathodes employed in SIBs [13- 35]. Similar to LIBs, the NaxCoO2 has been studied already in the early 1980s [32]. This cathode demonstrates reversible intercalation of Na+ ions in the phase NaxCoO2 (0.5 < x < 1), accompanied by a phase transition of the layered structure involving a change from octahedral or trigonal prismatic coordination to the monoclinically distorted phase packing [2,9,32,36]. Similarly to NaxCoO2, NaxMnO2 polymorphs are widely investigated as cathode materials for SIBs [13,37-46]. The α- NaxMnO2 phase is structurally more stable than its homologue high-T orthorombic β-NaxMnO2 phase (Fig. 2a), and shows a layered structure with monoclinic distortion. Based on ab initio studies, it has been found that the structure shown in Fig. 2b for Na0.44MnO2 have the lowest energy in the S-shaped tunnel [39]. The intercalation of Na+ in the α-phase allows 185 mAh.g-1 at C/10 rate with 71% capacity retention over 20 cycles, meanwhile 70% after 100 cycles is delivered when comparing to β-phase [46]. The charge/discharge profiles shown in Fig. 2c indicate a multi-step processes in relation to the presence of intermediate phases’ transformations [38]. It seems that not all these transformations and reactional pathways are well understood and consequently not yet determined in details [36]. Significant improvement of the long-term cyclability of the α-NaMnO2 phase has been achieved when the electrolyte 1M NaBF4/tetraethylene glycol dimethyl ether (TEGDME) is used instead of 1M NaClO4/EC:DEC [47]. Though in the presence of EC:DEC-based electrolyte the cell shows lower bulk and interfacial resistances. The electrolyte substitution with", "page": 4, "position": 0}

The cell is galvanostatically cycled between 2.0 V and 3.8 V [38]. Multiple cation transition metal oxides can be synthesized using co-precipitation in aqueous solution and extensive rinsing with distilled water [56]. The materials show high reversibility and good capacity retention with a specific capacity of 135 mAh g-1 and a Coulombic efficiency 99.7% over 250 cycles in ionic liquid medium [56]. In fact, the solubility of Mn has been pointed out in many studies. Then, substitution of carbonate-based electrolyte with an ionic liquid demonstrates uniform SEI layer at low and high voltage operation. A specific capacity of 200 mAh.g-1 has been reached with a capacity retention of about 80% after 100 cycles in the presence of 10 mol.% NaTFSI/N-butyl-N- methylpyrrolidinium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide electrolyte [56]. The structural study of the phase O3- NaNi0.5Ti0.5O2 has been reported to be suitable as cathode material for SIBs [57]. A schematic illustration of the structural model of O3-NaNi0.5Ti0.5O2 is presented in Fig. 3a. In this model, nickel and titanium ions are positioned at the octahedral sites of the MeO2 layer (3a sites, Me = Ni and Ti), while sodium ions are located at the octahedral sites of the NaO2 layer (3b sites). The model shows no cation intermixing between sodium and nickel ions due to their large difference in ionic diameter [57]. The material exhibits reversible structural behavior during (de)sodiation with an average voltage of 3.1 V vs. Na+/Na redox couple and a capacity of 121 mAh g-1 at C/5. At high rate (5C), 60% of the initial discharge capacity is obtained. Fig. 3b/d shows the good cyclability and stability of the electrode lifespan over 100 cycles at two different cycling rates (C/5 and 1C).

Further to the oxides, a series of sulfate, phosphate and fluoride materials has been studied as cathodes for SIBs. Na-S batteries undergo the same challenges as Li-S batteries regarding polysulfide dissolution and dendrite formation, which will not be approached in this review work [36,58]. In this category of material cathodes, Na2Fe2(SO4)3 showed the most interesting electrochemical features with a voltage of 3.8 V and delivering a capacity of 100 mAh.g-1 and 50% capacity retention at high rate 20C. The crystallography of this system is under study, where Na seems to occupy three different specific sites. The (de)intercalation of Na in this material is enhanced by the fast Na transfer, thanks to the 3D alluaudite framework with large tunnels along the c-axis [59]. The NASICON Na3V2(PO4)3 has been synthesized in nanograins and reached 98.6% of the theoretical capacity (117.6 mAh g-1) with high capacity retention at high C-rate [60]. In this structure, corner shared VO6 and PO4 polyhedra form a framework with large diffusion channels for Na-ions [60,61].

According to the working potential of 3.8 V (vs. Na+/Na) of vanadium redox couple, this leads to an energy density of 600 Wh kg-1 with 95% capacity retention for 100 cycles and ~84% for 500 cycles respectively [62]. 2.1.2.2. Anode materials Graphite anodes commonly used in LIBs, are not suitable for the intercalation of Na+ ions with larger ionic radii. Hard carbon was demonstrated as a host to accommodate inserted Na+ ions [63,64]. Furthermore, similar to lithium, pure metals, alloys, hydrides and oxides have been studied as different alternative known mechanisms operating in addition to intercalation, such as alloying and conversion reactions [65-75]. The first tests with hard carbon anodes led to an initial capacity of 220 mAh g-1 in NaClO4 / EC:DMC electrolyte, which decreases during cycling [64]. Hard carbon C1600 was reported as anode of Na ion battery. These electrodes were tested in different electrolyte media. A capacity retention was 90% over 50 cycles where an initial capacity 413 mAh g-1 is obtained in the presence of 1M NaClO4 / EC:DMC [76]. Previously, Ponrouch et al. [77] have demonstrated a half-cell battery with hard carbon having 200 mAh g-1 capacity, with a decent rate capability and cyclability over 180 cycles when using the same electrolyte. At present, hard carbon is selected to be the most suitable anode for SIBs, although a wide series of carbonaceous materials with different shapes and nanostructures are under study as well [78,79]. 2.1.2.3. Electrolytes for SIB Interfacial reactions are even more crucial for SIBs than for LIBs, because of the slow diffusion of Na+. Interfaces, SEI layer formation and charge transfer resistances are the factors that can be dependent on the electrolyte composition; hence this plays a determining role in a better optimization of the battery operation. Studies aiming at selection of the suitable electrolytes showed that the performance is electrode dependent. The electrolyte 1M NaClO4 / EC:PC offered more stable electrochemical performance of the Na4Fe3(PO4)2(P2O7) electrode with hard carbon anode for use in SIBs. The substitution of NaClO4 with NaPF6 offered better SEI", "page": 7, "position": 0}

For instance, EC0.45PC0.45DMC0.1 was selected for use in testing hard carbon anode and Na3V2(PO4)2F3 cathode vs. Na+/Na redox couple. The assembled Na-ion full cells demonstrated a working voltage of 3.65 V, low polarization and good capacity retention with a reversible capacity of ~97 mAh g-1 over 120 cycles with a coulombic efficiency > 98.5% [81]. The use of ionic liquids allowed to work with high voltage cathodes (> 4.2 V) such as Na0.45Ni0.22Co0.11Mn0.66O2, where also the dissolution of Mn can be avoided at low voltages [56], in addition to the improved safety features (low flammability and volatility), wide electrochemical/thermal stability, low vapor pressure and high ionic conductivity [82,83]. More safe electrolyte for SIBs is an aqueous-based one [84,85]. However, the low operating voltage 0-0.9 V vs. SCE (1M Na2SO4), may not be suitable for the current urgent demand for high power and high energy density applications [86]. 2.2. Multivalent systems 2.2.1. Mg batteries 2.2.1.1. Motivation, principle and historical development The dynamic interest in high energy density electrochemical storage systems such as “rechargeable magnesium batteries” (RMBs) has been fueled by the high capacity of Mg metal anode, dendrite-free Mg plating and stripping, and the promise of economic efficiency and sustainability. Indeed, magnesium metal anode has the theoretical capacities of 2200 mAh g-1 and 3835 mAh cm-3, the latter being almost double of that of Li. Another advantage of Mg over Li is the abundancy of Mg in the Earth crust being at least four orders of magnitude higher than that of Li [87,88]. Moreover, Mg is safer to handle than Li; it does not usually form toxic and/or dangerous compounds promising cost- effective and eco-friendly industrial processes. Early work of Brenner in the 1970th on the electrodeposition of magnesium from a solution containing decaborane, MgCl2 and anhydrous THF at room temperature (RT) can be regarded as the beginning of magnesium battery research [89]. In the following years, sporadic reports appeared until the 1990th when Gregory et al. published an extensive study on non-aqueous electrochemistry of magnesium [90]. They have examined a range of various intercalation cathodes (sulfides, oxides, and", "page": 8, "position": 0}

For a decade after this work, only scarce reports on magnesium battery components appeared emphasizing the difficulties to find suitable intercalation cathodes, electrolytes and chemically stable cell systems (Fig. 4). In the 2000th, Aurbach et al. reported a reversible Mg-battery composed of Mg organohaloaluminate-based electrolytes and Chevrel phase intercalation cathodes, mainly Mo6S8. These electrolytes exhibited higher anodic stability of 2.2 V compared to that of 1.5 V of Gregory et al. For the batteries with the best performance, based on the THF/Mg(AlCl2BuEt)2 electrolyte and MgxMo3S4 cathode, more than 2,000 charge–discharge cycles at 100% depth of discharge of the cathodes (rates 0.1–1 mA cm-2) with less than 15% capacity deterioration was demonstrated. The initial capacity of the systems was 60-90 mAh g-1. As noted in these early studies, despite of the obvious advantages of Mg anodes, the difficulties in finding the suitable combination of electrolyte- cathode-anode chemistries constituted (and still do) significant technical challenges and determine the direction of the research efforts [90,91]. Fig. 4 demonstrates in fact that cathodes and electrolytes have been the subject of the main research activity in the field [92]. The “cathode challenges” have been caused by difficulties of intercalating divalent high charge density magnesium cations in most of the known electrode hosts. A variety of structures with different geometries and chemical compositions has thus been explored so far. Among them, Chevrel- type cathodes have demonstrated the best performance in terms of specific capacity, Mg2+ intercalation kinetics, Coulombic efficiency, reversibility, and operational voltage [91,93]. On the other hand, these cathodes still possess rather low specific capacity of ~ 230 mAh g-1. The novel structures such as functionalized 2D sheets and fullerenes have been recently suggested as promising novel intercalation cathodes [94-96]. As an alternative, conversion cathodes such as sulfur or iodine were explored [97,98]. The conversion cathodes can offer high specific capacities of ca. 820 mAh g-1 but are not stable towards high operational voltages (> 1.5 V) [93]. In order to achieve the compromise between operational voltage and specific capacity,", "page": 9, "position": 0}

In order to achieve the compromise between operational voltage and specific capacity, breakthrough solutions are needed. The field of electrolyte development has been driven by search for compositions stable towards electrodes, forming favorable electrode-electrolyte interface, delivering high Mg2+ diffusion rates and not corroding the cell components. Several different types of electrolyte have been developed through the years, many targeted at a particular cathode type. First prototype batteries included electrolytes based on ether solutions with Mg organo-borate or organo-aluminate salts [90]. These compounds allowed for reversible plating and stripping of magnesium but were unstable towards high voltages (>1.5 V) and high capacity reversible electrophilic cathodes. The next-generation electrolytes based on ethereal solutions of magnesium halo-alkyl aluminate complex have improved the reversibility of Mg deposition and demonstrated high-voltage (2.5 V) stability [91]. These dichloro- complex electrolytes (DCC) demonstrated excellent reversibility of several thousand cycles, in particular in systems with Chevrel type cathodes and faster Mg2+ intercalation kinetics [99].

Both DCC and APC electrolytes have shown a large dependence on a particular chemical composition, solvents, additives, working temperature, the electrode composition, etc., and have possessed a challenging task even for a skilled organic chemist. Thus some attempts to develop all inorganic electrolytes [101], including solid-state electrolytes for all-solid-state RMB [102], and halide-free non-corrosive electrolytes [103,104] have been undertaken. The demonstration of the first proof-of-concept Mg-S battery required the development of non-nucleophilic electrolyte to exclude the chemical reaction with sulfur. For the conversion cathodes, electrolytes based on hexamethyldisilazide magnesium chloride (HMDSMgCl) have been developed [97]. At the same time, modifications of the anode material have been undertaken in order to increase its stability towards the electrolyte [105]. Figure 4.

For an efficient battery, the chemically stable cathodes with high electrochemical potential vs. Mg, and high capacities stable over many cycles are required. In addition, composition of non-toxic, abundant elements is highly desirable. In order to achieve the abovementioned requirements, several classes of cathodes have been explored as described below. Intercalation cathodes. Intercalation-type cathodes are a commercialized technology for Li- ion batteries, and have been considered as a benchmarking technology for magnesium batteries. By a sharp contrast to lithium, however, electrochemical insertion of the divalent Mg2+ into a solid host is significantly hampered by the increased charge density on the cations. This leads to strong interactions with the host, and thus slow kinetics and unfavorable thermodynamics of the insertion and diffusion processes. A multivalent cation diffusion depends significantly also on structure of the host that determines the diffusion pathway [111]. A variety of compounds has been proposed as candidates for intercalation magnesium cathodes. These structures can be classified as 3D diffusion channels (Chevrel phase, spinel), 2D layered structures, and 1D polyanion structures [112]. Chevrel phases are ternary molybdenum chalcogenides MxMo6X8 (X = chalcogen) with structures spanning from 3D lattices where the third element M can be inserted, up to a condensation of clusters giving rise to a 1D material [113]. Chevrel-type 3D cathodes have shown an excellent reversible intercalation kinetics for Mg2+ with capacities of ~120 mAh g-1 at 1.2 V [93,112]. The fast insertion kinetics for bivalent Mg2+ ions in the 3D Mo6S8 is attributed to the unusual structure of the Chevrel that allows for neutralizing the extra positive charge brought in by the guest Mg2+ and offers a large number of closely located sites for diffusion [114]. Furthermore, the special surface structure of the phase facilitates the desolvation of complex cations of Mg2+ from electrolyte at the electrolyte/cathode interface [115]. A significant disadvantage of the Mo6S8 cathode resides in the strong temperature dependence of the intercalation kinetics and partial (20-25%) irreversibility at RT due to the cation trapping [112].

A significant disadvantage of the Mo6S8 cathode resides in the strong temperature dependence of the intercalation kinetics and partial (20-25%) irreversibility at RT due to the cation trapping [112]. The Mo6Se8 phase provides more open and more polarizable structure with faster intercalation kinetics and ionic mobility for Mg2+, however, at the cost of capacity. Mixed phases of Mo6Se8-xSx have been synthetized to compromise between the kinetics and the capacity. The MgxMo6S6Se2 cathode allowed the storage capacity of 110-100 mAh g-1 at the voltage 1.1-1.3 V after 100 cycles in a cell with DCC electrolyte and Mg anode [100]. In search for higher voltages and capacities, a range of other structures has been explored for Mg intercalation. Spinel compounds with general formula MgT2X4, where T is a transition metal, and X stands for O, S, or Se, offer 3D channels where Mg2+ can diffuse along tetrahedral (tetra) → octahedral (octa) → tetra or octa → tetra → octa pathways [112]. The calculated Mg diffusion energy barriers in some spinel oxides are rather high for applications at practical temperatures [116]. Some work has been done with Mn2O4 owing to the high specific energy density, thermodynamic stability of both the charged and discharged phases, and acceptable volume change of the electrode.

Lower diffusion barriers were calculated for sulfide spinels, distinguishing Cr2S4, Ti2S4, and Mn2S4 structures out of 21 3d transition-metal sulfur-spinel compounds [119]. However, the improved mobility of magnesium cations comes at the expense of lower voltage and thereby lower theoretical specific energy. Experiments show that cycling Ti2S4 cathode in APC electrolyte at 60 °C demonstrated 230 mAh g─1 capacity with an average potential of 1.2 V at low rates [120]. At the same time, various attempts to remove Mg from MgCr2S4 spinel lattice appeared to be unsuccessful [121]. Achieving intercalation of Mg2+ at RT in structures with sufficient voltage and specific energy remains the largest obstacle for spinels to be the suitable cathodes for Mg batteries. Further studies in this direction are encouraged as well as the detailed characterization of the intercalation process [112]. In addition to spinel O, S, Se chalcogenides, much attention has been also devoted to layered compounds. In the layered compounds, week van der Waals forces between layers and the structural flexibility could presumably facilitate cation diffusion along the 2D channels. The layered TiS2/TiS3/TiSe2 [122-124], V2O5 [110,125-127] and MoO3 [126] have been explored demonstrating low to moderate capacities and reversibility. In search for higher capacities, faster intercalation kinetics, and lower migration barriers for Mg2+, nanosizing, doping (for example, with H2O, F) and creating defects, and forming solid solutions have been undertaken with variable outcomes [128-131]. Pre-intercalating Na or Li ions in the crystal structure of intercalation cathodes can improve the layered structure stability and electrochemical performance of the materials [132,133]. Fast intercalation kinetics in the layered molybdenum disulfide structures was demonstrated by using solvated magnesium-ions ([Mg(DME)x]2+).

One of the strategies employed to increase the capacity of Mg2+ insertion is regulation of the interlayer spacing. Thus, in polyanion compounds, such as layered VOPO4, consisting of corner-sharing VO6 octahedra linking to PO4 tetrahedra, the interlayer spacing provides enough diffusion space for fast kinetics of MgCl+ ion flux with low polarization [135]. The Mg battery with the 2D VOPO4 nanosheets cathode, demonstrated the highest capacity of 310 mAh g−1 at 50 mA g−1, and the highest reversible capacity of 192 mAh g−1 at 100 mA g−1 retained after 500 cycles. A reversible magnesium-ion storage capability of layered MXenes was theoretically predicted [95], and recently experimentally demonstrated for 3D porous MXene films [94]. MXenes represent a family of transition metal carbides and nitrides with the formula Mn+1XnTx, where M is an early transition metal (Ti, Nb, V, Ta, Cr, Mo), X is carbon and/or nitrogen, n = 1, 2, or 3, and Tx are surface groups such as OH, O, and/or F [136].

Polyanion compounds with 1D diffusion channels, such as phosphate and silicate olivine compounds or Prussian blue frameworks, can potentially intercalate Mg2+ cations with promisingly high cell voltage ranging from 2.3 V vs. Mg/Mg2+ to 2.8–3.0 V [140]. The phosphate compounds, however, have demonstrated a very poor performance. Thus, the olivine FePO4 was shown to deliver ∼13 mAh g-1 in a non-aqueous electrolyte. The intercalation promoted amorphization of the cathode and thus annihilation of the diffusion/intercalation reaction [141]. On the contrary, ion-exchanged MgFeSiO4 demonstrated a significantly better performance with high reversible capacity exceeding 300 mAh g-1 at a voltage of approximately 2.4 V vs. Mg for 5 cycles [92,142]. Prussian blue has exhibited very moderate intercalation properties [112]. Conversion cathodes. Thermodynamically favorable redox reactions at the conversion electrodes may offer a solution to the slow kinetics of Mg intercalation. These cathodes can be classified into type A and B depending on whether an exchange or a recombination reaction occurs at the electrode [143] : Type A (exchange reaction): MXa + Mg2 + ae− ⇄ M + MgX2 (1) Type B (combination reaction): Mg2 + Xa + 2e−⇄ MgXa (2) The type A cathodes typically include transition metal halides, oxides, chalcogenides, nitrides or phosphides as MXa compounds.

Unfortunately, this system suffered from poor cyclability [109]. In the type A reaction, an intermediate insertion phase is formed with an efficiency depending on ion mobility. Unfortunately, the latter is not a strong side of Mg2+ ions as have already been mentioned. Thus, the A-type electrodes, also in case of Li batteries, typically suffer from a poor electronic conductivity, large voltage hysteresis, large volume change and low conversion efficiency [143]. The type B cathodes can be composed of a single element chalcogene (S, Se, Te) or a halogen (Br, I2), often dispersed in a high surface area matrix (e.g. activated carbon, graphite, etc.). Mg-air batteries can also be classified as those with type B cathode (oxygen). Mg-S batteries can demonstrate a theoretical cell voltage of 1.77V and energy density of 1,722 Wh kg−1 and 3,200 Wh l−1 [143]. Sulfur is usually dispersed in a high surface area matrix, and the matrix itself seems to have a large impact on the performance of the cathode through regulating sulfur loading and formation of soluble polysulfides that deteriorate the cyclability of the cathode. For instance, using ZIF-67 highly porous metal-organic framework (MOFs), a Co- and N-doped carbon support for the sulfur cathode was obtained [144]. This strategy resulted in first discharge capacity of ≈700-600 mAh g−1 (at 0.1 and 1 C), and unprecedentedly high cyclic stability, where the ≈300-400 mAh g−1 capacity after 150–250 cycles was still maintained when cycling at the up to 5 C rate. The MOF-derivative carbon support doped with N and Co was suggested to trap soluble polysulfides, which in turn allowed for the higher S loading (47%). The addition of Li+ and Cl─ aided in the dissolution of low-order polysulfides, which allowed for the excellent performance. A magnesium/iodine battery have recently been demonstrated [98]. The system showed 180 mAh g-1 - 140 mAh g-1 at 0.5-1 C and higher energy density by ca. 400 Wh kg-1 than the systems with intercalation cathodes.

In these systems, the stability of electrolyte towards cathodes also seems to be a considerable issue. Relatively little research has been made on Mg-air systems although theory predicts promising energy densities [112]. The most notable challenge of this technology seems to be in passivating the surface of the Mg anode, which is very sensitive even to O-containing impurities as discussed below. 2.2.1.2.2. Anodes for Mg batteries The volumetric capacity of magnesium anode is almost twice than that of Li, and the electrochemical deposition-dissolution process is dendrite free at most experimental conditions. On the other hand, upon contact with oxidizing media, magnesium forms surface layers such as MgO and/or Mg(OH)2 that inhibit plating and striping. Electrolyte solutions conventional for Li batteries usually promote the formation of the passivating layers as well as O2 or H2O impurities at levels of 3 ppm [145]. While the main research efforts have been focused on developing electrolytes, the anode modifications have also been proposed with the aim to tune the anodic high reduction capacity.", "page": 14, "position": 1}

This performance was explained by a decrease in the thickness of the passivation surface layer [146]. We note that theory predicts 1042 mAh g-1 Mg capacity for defective graphene [147]. Alloying Mg may enable fast and efficient magnesium plating and striping, adequate redox potential over the whole range of magnesiation, low toxicity and reasonable cost [93]. Bismuth and Bi- based compounds appear to be most interesting candidates [148]. The rhombohedric crystalline structure of Bi facilitates the formation of high capacity MgxBiy alloys, assuming the reaction: 2Bi + 3Mg2+ + 6e− → Mg3Bi2 The theoretical capacity 385 mAh g-1 can be achieved which is comparable to that of Li- graphite technology (372 mAh g-1). Arthur et al. [105] presented a study of electrochemical magnesiation / demagnesiation in one cycle of Bi in a Mg(N(SO2CF3)2)2 / acetonitrile solution as a proof-of-concept for compatibility of a Bi anode with conventional battery electrolytes. They have obtained specific anode capacities of 257-222 mAh g─1 over 100 cycles in an electrolyte composed of ethylmagnesium chloride, diethylaluminum chloride in THF. The compatibility of Mg3Bi thin films electrodes with the acetonitrile and glyme-based solutions was also recently demonstrated [149]. Approximately half of the Bi-Mg theoretical capacity, but with significant deterioration in the subsequent cycles, was demonstrated in the first cycle in a Bi-carbon nanotubes composite electrodes in acetonitrile-0.5M(Mg(ClO4)2)-ether electrolyte [150]. Application of Bi nanotubes in a Mg(BH4)2- LiBH4-diglyme electrolyte yielded in a specific capacity of 350 mAh g-1 with 95-100 % Coulombic efficiency for 200 cycles. The cell composed of Mg3Bi2 anode, Mo6S8 cathode, and a conventional Mg(TFSI)2–diglyme-electrolyte [151] showed a similar performance. Alloying Bi with Sb in Bi 0.88Sb0.12 ratio yielded in 298 mAh g─1, which decreased to 215 mAh g-1 over 100 cycles at 1C rate; whereas pure antimony anodes demonstrated very poor capacity [105].

In all, if the alloy anode can offer high stability towards conventional electrolyte solutions, this compatibility comes at the cost of high equilibrium potential and reduced specific capacity [149]. Various Mg-based alloys have been also studied for primary (non-rechargeable) seawater and air batteries [153]. Recently, arsenene (single-layer arsenic nanosheet) has been predicted to be a potential anode candidate for Li/Na-ion and Mg batteries. In the latter case, Arsenene can store Mg via adsorption with theoretical capacity 1430 mAh g−1 and low voltage [154]. 2.2.1.2.3. Electrolytes for Mg batteries Electrolyte, along with the cathode, has been another hurdle on the way to an efficient rechargeable magnesium battery. The main requirements to the electrolyte are favorable electrochemical properties, fast magnesium conductivity, chemical stability towards electrodes, non- corrosive, non-toxic and potentially inexpensive composition. Reversible Mg deposition and dissolution do not occur in most polar organic electrolytes used in LIBs [90]. The reversible reaction can occur in Grignard electrolytes solutions in ethereal solvents (R-Mg-X, where R is an alkyl or aryl group, and X is Cl or Br). However, these are highly reducing and are unstable towards high capacity electrophilic cathodes [155]. A large effort has therefore been devoted to developing compatible electrolyte-electrode chemistries. First prototype batteries were based on electrolytes composed of ether solutions with Mg organo-borate or organo-aluminate complexes [90] and ethereal solutions of magnesium halo-alkyl aluminate complex [91]. The oxidative stability of magnesium organohaloaluminate electrolytes and the Coulombic efficiency have been gradually improved. Firstly, by tuning the ratio of organomagnesium to the Lewis acid, the DCC (dichloro complex) electrolyte was developed with higher oxidative stability of 2.2V vs. Mg and 100% Coulombic efficiency [91,100,156], though questioned at some point [157]. These electrolytes have demonstrated superior reversibility of Mg2+ intercalation in particular with Chevrel-type cathodes and improved conductivity.

However, the contradictions in the reported properties of DCC aroused the concerns that its synthesis was too complicated for practical use [100], and the electrochemistry was temperamental and dependent on strict conditions of synthesis and quality of the starting materials [155]. Moreover, higher oxidation stabilities were desirable. Substitution of the alkyl groups in DCC with aromatics led to the synthesis of all phenyl complex (APC) electrolyte allowing for increase in the oxidative stability to 3.0 V - 5 V vs. Mg [100,158]. Higher potentials are reached when AlCl3 is substituted with aluminium triphenoxide [155,158], or fluoro-compounds added to the electrolyte [159,160]. Both solution and crystallized form of APC (Mg2(μ-Cl)3·6THF)(PhnAlCl4-n), n=1, 2, 3, 4), appear to be electrochemically active [97,100,155,161].

The largest oxidative stability to date of 3.7 V for the electrolyte containing magnesium dimer was reported for the crystallized magnesium organoborate (Mg2(μ- Cl)3·6THF)(B(C6F5)3Ph) [162]. MgCl2-ionic liquid electrolytes (δ-MgCl2 in 1-ethyl-3- methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate (EMImBF4) ionic liquid) have also shown promising electrolytic performance [163]. Non-nucleophilic electrolytes (Mg2(μ-Cl)3·6THF)(HMDSAlCl3) compatible with sulfur reduction cathodes have been also developed [97,164]. In all the electrolyte systems mentioned above, a halide plays a significant role enabling and/or facilitating Mg diffusion and/or intercalation. However, the corrosive nature of halides, in particular, chloride, has been pushing for alternative solutions. Starting from 1990th, halide-free boron-based electrolytes have been developed and investigated [155]. Magnesium organoborate Mg(BBu4)2 electrolyte demonstrates the oxidative stability of 1.9 V and a low overpotential. Trispentafluorophenylborane (B(C6F5)3) demonstrated the stability of 3.7 V vs. Mg [162]. Reversible Mg deposition and dissolution was demonstrated for magnesium(II) bis(- trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (Mg(TFSI)2) in glyme, but with high overpotential and a low Coulombic efficiency [165].

[107] first demonstrated that the reversible Mg deposition/stripping with the cycling capability (4 cycles) of 128.8 mAh g-1 and 94% coulombic efficiency was possible from electrolyte containing Mg(BH4)2 in dimethoxyethane (DME or glyme) with LiBH4 additive, Mo6S8 anode and Mg metal cathode.

The polarizing power of Ca2+ cations is in between those of Mg2+ and Li+ promising moderate interaction with solvent and intercalation host. Moreover, similar to Li/Li+ the value of the standard electrode potential gives the prospect of high-voltage batteries, by contrast to RMB. The problems encountered with CAB are similar to those of RMB and other multivalent batteries, i.e., low diffusion rates of Ca2+ and high reduction potential towards electrolyte, formation of passivation layers at anodic surface, and thus a challenge of finding the suitable cathodes, electrolytes, and steadily efficient compatible battery chemistries. Metallic Ca anodes, similar to those of Mg, would offer superior volumetric and gravimetric capacities with respect to the graphitic anodes in Li-ion battery technology (2072 mAh cm−3 and 1337 mAh g−1 vs. 300–430 mAh cm−3 and 372 mAh g−1, respectively) [178]. However, the non-conducting surface layers rapidly formed on the electrolyte/anode interface upon discharge, appear to be detrimental for the calcium deposition. Depending on the electrolyte, these films can consist, for example, of Ca(OH)2, CaCO3, calcium alkoxides [179], CaF2 [180]. The reversible deposition process is possible at elevated temperatures at ~100 °C [180].

In this Ca-ion full battery both electrodes were carbon-based intercalation type layered structures, where Ca2+ was plated and stripped reversibly to/from the Ca(PF6)2 electrolyte in carbonate solution (a mixture of ethylene carbonate (EC), dimethyl carbonate (DMC) and ethyl methyl carbonate (EMC)).

The insertion of Ca2+ into the crystalline V2O5 cathode with a discharge capacity of ~ 450 mAh g-1 was demonstrated but only at very low current densities of 50 μA cm-2 at RT. The intercalation causes the formation of a new phase coexisting with the pristine V2O5 phase [185].

Bervas et al. have achieved the specific capacity of 465 mAh g-1 for Ca2+ intercalation in the vanadate nanocomposite with propylene carbonate (PC). Two to ten times better performance over the conventional V2O5 structure owing to the presence of PC was demonstrated [186]. CaMO3 perovskites (M = Mo, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni) were shown to be unsuitable as Ca-intercalation cathodes [187]. Lipson et al. first demonstrated the feasibility of Ca2+ intercalation into layered fluorinated sodium iron phosphate in 0.2 M Ca(PF6)2 / EC-PC (3:7) electrolyte [188]. They obtained an initial capacity of 60 mAh g-1 which actually increased to 80 mAh g-1 after the 50th cycle at the average voltage of 2.6 V vs. Ca/Ca2+. The authors suggest that diffusion limits the intercalation process of calcium into Na2FePO4F. A recent report has shown that reversible Ca plating and stripping in conventional alkyl carbonate electrolytes at moderate temperature is feasible, prompting moderate optimism [180]. Yet promoting diffusion of large divalent ions in intercalation hosts implies great challenges. Overall, and despite the outstanding fundamental studies, the development of Ca-based rechargeable battery in the twenty-first century seems unlikely, unless the challenges are addressed through new creative approaches by battery chemists [189].", "page": 20, "position": 1}

The crystal unit consists of the counter anion [B(hfip)4]- bonded with four hexafluoroisopropyloxy groups with a tetrahedral geometry. The Ca2+ ion is solvated with four DME molecules. Due to the larger size of Ca2+ ion compared to Mg2+ ion, and the weaker O-interaction, it is assumed that the desolvation energy for Ca2+ ion can be lower than that of Mg2+ ion, which is beneficial for the intercalation mechanism [190].

Overview of Zn batteries Rechargeable aqueous Zinc-ion batteries (ZIBs) are considered as an easy to realize alternative battery chemistry. The overall drawbacks and the high cost of batteries requiring use of inert atmosphere, such as LIBs/SIBs with toxic and flammable electrolytes based on carbonate solvents, motivate elaboration of novel research ideas regarding alternative chemistries and simplified large-scale manufacturing, where cost, safety, long-cycle life and recycling has to be reconsidered [5,6,193]. Furthermore, aqueous electrolytes have a higher ionic conductivity (~1 S cm-1) as compared to non- aqueous electrolytes (~0.01 S cm-1). The ZIBs operating in aqueous media offer potential applicability in grid-scale related energy storage [194,195]. Different battery configurations have been tested and reported in literature [196,197]. Efforts have been made for further improvements and detailed mechanistic studies have been reported for rechargeable alkaline Zn-MnO2 batteries, which suffered from the formation of Zn dendrites and irreversible discharge capacities [198-200]. Indeed, many research works have been published dealing with aqueous ZIBs, which include use of Zn anode and various cathode materials, such as manganese and vanadium-based oxides, Prussian blue analogs as well as polyanion compounds etc [194,201-205]. The mechanism of the energy storage in aqueous ZIBs is not straightforward as the system acts in slightly acidic aqueous medium. For instance, many compounds with tunnel-type and layered structure enable the insertion/extraction of Zn2+ ions [194], according to the following reactions in the presence of diluted ZnSO4 or Zn(NO3)2: Cathode: Zn2+ + 2e- + 2αMnO2  ZnMn2O4 (1) Anode: Zn  Zn2+ + 2e- (2) Other polymorphs of MnO2 may show more complicated electrochemistry, with multi-step phase transitions (e.g. from tunnel-type to layered structures owing to the expansion of the structure) [206,207]. Later studies have included the work on Zn/vanadium oxides batteries [208]. Indeed, V-based cathodes for ZIBs offer more stability and various V oxidation states compared to Mn-based cathodes. Furthermore, V-O coordination can adopt different polyhedral units, including tetrahedron, trigonal bipyramid, square pyramid, distorted octahedron and regular octahedron, which", "page": 22, "position": 0}

The number of inserted Zn-ions seems to depend on the electrolyte system (i.e. solvent and salt conc.). Compared to Mn, several V-based cathodes approach the specific capacity 400 mAh g-1. Particularly, the cathode Zn0.25V2O5.nH2O has been studied in more details, regarding the electrochemical properties and structure, which can be modified by intercalation of water molecules. The presence of water seems to facilitate the Zn2+ intercalation owing to the expanded structure. The electrochemical behavior is highly reversible where 1.1 Zn2+ are exchanged to form Zn1.35V2O5.nH2O. The mechanism is rather complex which may include multi-step reaction pathways [208,211].

Taking into consideration the electrochemical performance, safety of aqueous electrolyte, low-cost electrode material, the battery could be promising for grid-scale energy storage applications. 2.2.4. Al batteries: Electrolyte challenges Available Al batteries are consisting of Al and pyrolytic graphite/carbon. These components are relatively cheap , except the battery makes use of room temperature ionic liquids which are non- flammable [213]. High power has been demonstrated in a such configuration with 7,500 cycle lifespan. However, the battery is still at the early stage of development as it shows low energy density, due to the difficulties related to the intercalation of large cations such Al3+ into the host cathode material. As a consequence, the application domain is restrained and the initial cost is rather high. In the following, we will present the most relevant results for future applications. The first Al-ion rechargeable battery was demonstrated in 2011 [214]. The battery used V2O5 nanowires as the cathode and Al metal as anode in ionic liquid-based electrolyte. The Al-ion battery demonstrates a well-defined Al3+ intercalation plateau at 0.55 V (vs. Al3+/Al). In the first cycle, it exhibits a capacity of 305 mAh g-1 against 273 mAh g-1 at the end of 20 cycles. Another Al-ion battery consisting of a fluorinated natural graphite nanosheet as cathode was obtained with a charge capacity of approximately 300 mAh g-1, but the columbic efficiency of the cell (75%), though stable during 40 cycles, is abnormal [215]. Recently, an Al ion battery with 3D graphitic-foam as the positive electrode was presented [213]. The cell exhibits well-defined discharge voltage plateaus near 2V (vs. Al3+/Al) and long cycle life up to 7500 cycles at ultrahigh current densities.", "page": 24, "position": 0}

Although the beneficial properties of ionic liquid-based electrolytes (chloroaluminate) of the above Al-ion batteries, the cost is still high. An aqueous rechargeable aluminum battery was assembled using these graphite nanosheets as the positive electrode and zinc as the negative electrode in Al2(SO4)3/Zn(CHCOO)2 aqueous electrolyte [216]. This battery could be rapidly charged and discharged at a high current density. The average charge and discharge voltages are 1.35 and 1.0 V, respectively. The graphite nanosheets show a discharge capacity of 60 mAh g-1 even at 2 A g-1. In comparison to rechargeable Al-ion batteries in ionic liquid electrolytes, one must highlight the high working voltage and stable cycling behavior (over 200 charging/discharging cycles) at low cost using aqueous electrolytes. One of the current issues of this kind of aqueous rechargeable aluminum battery is that it needs highly concentrated Al", "page": 24, "position": 1}

Anionic shuttles 3.1. F-ion battery: a novel solid-state battery The fluoride ion has a wide electrochemical stability window of 6 V and it is very stable for charge transfer in a battery owing to its high electronegativity. The transfer of the fluoride ion between two electrodes enables reversible electrochemical storage. In a simple concept, the ion shuttles between two metal electrodes and the difference in the free energy of formation of the respective halide results in an electromotive force. Due to the theoretical voltages in the range of 1-3 V, due to the change of several oxidation states of the respective metal and due to the high densities of metal fluoride, high theoretical energy densities are possible. The reactions at the electrodes during discharge are as follows: Cathode: xe- + MFx  M + xF- Anode: xF- + M´  M´Fx + xe- The first reversibly working F ion battery based on BiF3 cathode and Ce anode was demonstrated by Anji Reddy et al., using a solid state electrolyte based on a tysonite structure [217,218]. However, although tysonites are “superionic conductors” for fluoride, the ionic conductivity is still low at room temperature (10-7 S cm-1) so that the battery was operated at 160 °C, one reason was the electrolyte layer which was thick (600 µm) for mechanical stability reasons. Follow-up work focused on understanding the role of interfaces in the ionic transfer in bulk materials and on improvement of the overall ionic conductance, e.g. by using thin film electrolytes and sintered materials [219]. Recently, progress was made by the development of a first battery working at room temperature [220,221]. This was possible due to a novel electrolyte based on ternary fluorides such as BaSnF4 and BiSnF4 which offer higher ionic conductivities, in the order of 10-1 S cm-1.

Rechargeable batteries are comparably easy to realize because a liquid electrolyte transporting chloride ions can be made from a mixture of suitable ionic liquids with chloride ion and large cation and other solvents. Such systems have been demonstrated to work at room temperature and tested at comparably high rates, up to 2C [223]. A key challenge in this concept is the solubility of many chlorides in the electrolyte which limits the application of, e.g. FeCl3 as electrode material. Here, the development goes into the direction of using chloride hosts with low solubility, oxychlorides for example. Another approach would be the development of solid electrolytes with high Cl-ion conductivity. Solid inorganic compounds such as PbCl2, SnCl2, and LaOCl show fast chloride mobility only at high temperatures, even higher than the melting points of some metal chlorides [222,224]. More promising ionic conductivity (1 mS cm-1, 100 °C) has been reported for the cubic phase CsSnCl3. However, the electrochemical properties for suitability in the battery system needs to be studied further [225,226]. 4. MH-based Batteries 4.1. NiMH batteries Metal hydrides are extensively studied for their properties to store reversibly hydrogen gas making them suitable for solid state storage tanks. Beside the solid-gas route, these materials can also serve as suitable anodes for rechargeable alkaline NiMH batteries [227-231]. Indeed, they have led to practical applications to power light electronic devices or emergency light units. Recently, they found a new market as auxiliary storage units in hybrid cars (either ICE or FCEV). Despite lower efficiency compared to lithium batteries, NiMH are cheaper, they offer much more safe operation in case of overheating, and they support high rate (dis-)charge currents.

This was achieved by substitution of nickel by other elements like manganese, aluminum, cobalt or iron, giving materials ability to sustain thousands of cycles with specific capacities exceeding 300 mAh g-1. Next generations of alloys are now based on so-called intergrowth phases. They consist in RTy (R: Rare earth or Mg; T: Transition metals; 2<y<5) stacking structures made of [R2T4] and [RT5] sub-units. Khan [233] describes these structures using the general formula: y=(5n+4)/(n+2) (where n is the number of [RT5] units). These phases are usually polymorphic, depending on the repetition of the sequence n[RT5]+[R2T4] along the c axis; either three times for rhombohedral or two times for hexagonal structure. A decisive breakthrough was achieved for these materials by developing ternary Mg-containing materials. Indeed, part of the rare earth can be substituted, exclusively in the [R2T4] sub-units, by magnesium [234-236]. In this way, amorphization easily induced by repeated hydrogenation of the binary phases can be reduced. In addition, stabilization of multi-plateau pressure features commonly observed in RTy binary hydrides can be lessened into one single plateau stabilized in the practical pressure range. Consequently, working anode materials with significant reduction of the molar mass are obtained leading to weight capacity enhancement up to about 400 mAh g-1 [236-238]. Complex multistep transformations taking place during the heating of La-Mg-Ni alloys proceed between 700 and 1050 °C [239] and show that to synthesize single phase intermetallics of a particular type, a strict control over the temperature and content of easily sublimated Mg is required. Rapid solidification when its conditions are properly selected allows both increase the content of Mg- containing layered structures and also to synthesize nanosized alloys [240]. Hydrogen storage and electrochemical performance (Fig. 9) with capacity reaching 420 mAh g-1 can be optimized by (a) selecting stoichiometry – AB3 or A2B7- and type of the alloy’s structure; (b) changing the ratio between rare earth metal and magnesium (optimal compositions", "page": 28, "position": 0}

For a drastic increase of the capacity, the light Mg-H2 system remains a key one but the slow hydrogenation kinetic, the poor resistance of Mg to corrosion and the high thermodynamic stability of MgH2 remains an issue [249]. Corrosion resistance can be improved by suitable surface engineering such as Nafion coating [250]. A step forward is foreseen by developing richer Mg-based materials using nanoscaled structures [251,252]. Long Period Stacking Order (LPSO) phases can be prepared to form a serie of Mg and (R,Mg)Ty layers stacked along the c-axis, in a very similar way to the RTy compounds mentioned above, expecting higher capacities. Light weight intermetallic compounds, such as AB2, AB and V-based BCC solid solutions likely offer the best though still challenging compromise between high capacity and resistance to corrosion in alkaline media. Progress in AB2 and V-based compounds have been extensively considered in recent reviews [253]. These compounds offer high discharge capacities reaching 400 mAh g-1 but sometimes suffer from poor activation while their cost should be optimized. Recent studies of the Zr- and Ti- containing Laves-type intermetallics (Fig. 10) showed their excellent high rate performance with electrochemical storage capacities exceeding 420 mAh g-1 and possibilities to optimize electrochemical behaviors as related to a) type of structure - C15/C14; b) ratio between Zr and Ti; c) selection of chemical composition of B (Mn, Ni, Fe, V, Sn, Al) and B/A ratio; d) Presence of catalytic additive – small amounts of La providing easy activation of the alloys; e) Metallurgical route of alloy’s preparation with benefits of increased H", "page": 29, "position": 0}

As for AB-compounds, they are considered as attractive anode materials since early studies in NiMH batteries [260]. Being exempt of scarce and expensive rare earths, they have gained renewed interest in recent years [261-264]. Research works have been focused on A = Ti and B = Fe, Co and Ni elements. Within this family, TiFe might be considered at a first sight as the most interesting alloy since it has the highest hydrogenation capacity (2 hydrogen atoms by formula unit (H/f.u.) at normal thermodynamic conditions. Potentially, it can provide as high as 500 mAh g-1 in electrochemical units. Unfortunately, due to surface passivation, TiFe is not electrochemically active in alkaline media, a fact that can be partially solved by partial replacement of Fe by Ni [265]. Binary TiCo has electrocatalyic activity but suffers from severe Co corrosion [266]. Finally, the best choice turns to be TiNi as this compound has excellent electrocatalytic activity as well as good resistance to corrosion in alkaline media, both being attributed to Ni [260,267,268]. However, TiNi has a modest electrochemical capacity of 150 mAh g-1 at C/10 regime, much lower than its hydrogenation capacity at normal thermodynamic conditions: 1.4 H/f.u. (i.e. 350 mAh g-1 in electrochemical units). In fact, most hydrogen stored in TiNi is too tightly bonded for being extracted electrochemically. Chemical substitutions have been chased to tackle this issue. Emami et al. have studied TiNi1-xB’x alloys with B’ = Co [269] and Cu [270] and 0  x  0.5.

For B’ = Co, PCT isotherms have a multi-plateau behavior which is beneficial to enhance the cycle-life of TiNi-based electrodes at low substitution contents (x  0.3). At higher substitution ratios, significant capacity decay attributed to Co corrosion is observed. Cu-substitution is even more interesting for eventual applications. It enlarges the cell volume of TiNi but, contrary to geometric expectations, it leads to significant destabilization of the TiNi hydride. As a consequence, hydrogen bonding to TiNi is weakened and the experimental capacity can be significantly raised. By replacing 20% of Ni by Cu, the reversible capacity doubles: 300 mAh g-1 at C/10 regime. Furthermore, TiNi0.8Cu0.2 electrodes have easy activation and good kinetics up to C/2 regime. 4.2.

Most of the current anodes use Li intercalation into carbonaceous materials, mainly graphite. Though efficient in terms of cycle life (with formation of a stable SEI) and kinetics, these materials are intrinsically limited in capacities (typically 370 mAh g-1 for graphite). To improve the energy density, other reactions are foreseen like alloying with highly capacitive elements (Si, Sn) or conversion reactions [271]. For the latter, metallic hydrides have shown over the past decade that they offer an interesting alternative to other materials [272-276]. This was first demonstrated by Oumellal et al. [277] that established the following conversion reaction: MHx + xLi+ + xe-  M + xLiH (3) Using metal hydrides brings several advantages: low potential for anodes, low polarization (the lowest compared to other binary MYx compounds such as oxides, phosphides, nitrides…) and very high capacities. This latter parameter depends on both the M molar mass and the H content x. Again, Mg- based hydrides have been studied due to the light weight of Mg, its abundance and low cost. From the early works, it was observed that the reaction is thermodynamically favorable (as Gf(MgH2)/2 > Gf(LiH)) but kinetically sluggish. This can be overcome by a cautious nanostructuring of MgH2 [277,278] and by tuning the composition of the composite electrode (by using additives of carbon and polymer binder, like carboxymethyl cellulose) [279,280] to handle the poor electronic conductivity of the hydride and large volume changes (84%) upon lithiation. Despite these efforts, even if the lithiation is straightforward, delithiation remains very challenging at room temperature for this hydride. For a better understanding of the limiting factors, the reaction was studied in 2D geometry using a 1 m thick MgH2 thin film [281]. This model system showed that the lithiation is indeed fully completed at the first cycle with a doubling of the film thickness, while only 25% of delithiation could be achieved. From TEM images it was shown that the cohesion of the film was preserved. Resistivity measurements indicate that", "page": 31, "position": 0}

From TEM images it was shown that the cohesion of the film was preserved. Resistivity measurements indicate that the formation of metallic Mg increased the conductivity of the film. Therefore, the poor delithiation rate of the film was assigned to the kinetic limitations related to poor mass transport at room temperature. To overcome this drawback, formulation of composite materials can be valuable. As an example, mixing different amounts of MgH2 and TiH2 brings new insights into the reaction mechanism. Several groups [282-284] investigated these mixtures of Mg and Ti hydrides as anode materials. Again, lithiation was straightforward but Li extraction was strongly related to the ratio between both hydrides. Depending of the composition, reformation of both hydrides (MgH2-rich mixture), partial reversibility of TiH2 only (equimolar mixture) or full irreversibility (TiH2-rich mixture) of the composite are observed. A cooperative effect between the two phases is clearly observed and, interestingly, good reversibility and lower polarization are obtained for the conversion reaction of the TiH2 phase when cycled in a Mg/LiH matrix. This has been correlated to the modification of the interfaces between the active species (LiH, TiH2 and Mg) and a better volume change adaptation. Other strategies remain opened to improve the efficiency of these Mg-based materials, especially by", "page": 31, "position": 1}

The pure and Li-doped NiTiH systems have been also studied using DFT and MD calculations and predicted to be suitable anode for LIBs [293]. Clear evidence of practical improvements has been highlighted regarding the electrochemical capacity, minor increase in the voltage and volume change for the Li-doped NiTiH system. Overall, to discard any issue with liquid electrolytes during voltage solicitation, the use of solid-state electrolytes based on LiBH4 have been investigated at high temperatures (RT-120°C) with significant improvements of the reversibility and cycling performance of the hydride anodes [290,292,294-296]. A detailed review has been published recently on the contribution of hydrides to solid-state batteries [274]. The study highlights the possibility of next generation LIBs with high capacity and energy density where safer solid-state electrolyte is used instead of a carbonate-based liquid one. 5. Discussion and major challenges ahead 5.1. Cationic shuttles Na-ion batteries. Significant exploits and rapid progress beyond LIBs have been made in the last decade, as evidenced by the large number of publications reviewed in this work. The intensive research on SIBs can be attributed to the similarity between LIBs and SIBs in their chemistries, mechanistic properties and manufacturing processes. Depending on application area, the developed cathodes and anodes for SIBs can now compete with the performance of a classical LIB. In portable devices, the Li-ion batteries may provide 3.8V and a specific energy of 408 Wh kg-1 with 200 cycles or more (electrodes only; e.g. LiCoO2 and graphite anode). This performance is gradually approached by SIBs when combing Na1.5VPO4.8F0.7 cathode and nanostructured carbon anode or tin anodes, to make a SIB with 210 cycle life and a specific energy ~300 Wh kg-1. If some cathodes could offer the possibility of the insertion of more than one Na ion and a specific capacity higher than 150 mAh g-1 [297,298], more research development of these cathodes at the cell level need to be pursued. Though tin anode can be a choice for substituting to carbon, however, the molar mass will affect significantly the gravimetric", "page": 32, "position": 0}

Ionic liquids can be an alternative for carbonate-based electrolytes. However, low temperature operating conditions and long synthesis and purification protocols are still a challenge. Mg batteries. There has been a substantial research effort made in the development of magnesium batteries. Several prototype cells have been demonstrated based on various anode-electrolyte-cathode technologies. The key challenge for RMB remains in finding compatible electrode-electrolyte chemistries that are able to intercalate and conduct magnesium ions safely, efficiently and with acceptable cyclability. In particular, current research status for electrolytes can be summarized as follows: o They possess low electrochemical stability that dictate the voltage charging limits of typically around 3 V but in most cases around 1.5 V. o Halides and fluorides enabling fast diffusion of Mg2+ ions are corrosive towards the cell components and can be explosive. Aluminate ion, also typical for the electrolyte composition, is sensitive to water and air. Therefore, finding alternative electrolyte chemistries should be the focus for future research in high-voltage magnesium batteries. o The complicated organic chemistries demonstrate dependence on synthetic conditions and history/quality of the chemicals. The complex synthesis reactions can be difficult to reproduce. The development of magnesium solid ionic conductors [102] for all solid-state magnesium battery seems an interesting and promising direction that could overcome some of the aforementioned challenges. Furthermore, a significant challenge is within optimizing the electrodes. Intercalation cathodes are more stable towards higher voltages but offer low specific capacities. Conversion cathodes could be especially interesting for high-energy density Mg batteries but they are stable at rather modest cycling. For the anode, the formation of passivation layers promoted by oxygen and moisture present a serious concern. These layers block the diffusion of Mg2+ cations and deteriorate the cell’s performance. Furthermore, recent findings demonstrate the growth of dendritic magnesium deposits upon the galvanostatic electrodeposition of metallic Mg from Grignard reagents in symmetric Mg–Mg cells [299-303]. The suggested approach is that instead of stating the dendrite-free anode magnesiation and demagnesiation, one should rather clearly define the electrochemical windows where magnesium can be plated/stripped without dendrite", "page": 33, "position": 0}

The research results are obtained under different conditions, using different types of electrolytes, cathodes, and sometimes anodes. The performance of such systems is defined by the overall cell combination, which makes it difficult to draw a proper conclusion on the performance of an individual components. The non-reliability of the pseudo-reference electrodes as these present both significant potential shifts as well as cause unstable behaviors was noted and an attempt to develop experimental protocols in order to achieve consistent results when using half-cell set-ups was proposed [306]. Ca-ion batteries. The diffusion of Ca2+, as well as other divalent cations, into the metallic anodes and intercalation hosts is slow, and most reported Ca-ion batteries exhibit low working voltage (<2.0 V), and poor cycling stability (within 100 cycles). Diffusion of polyvalent cations through most inorganic metal oxides or sulphides is slowed down due to the high charge density. The limitations can be overcome by using hydrated compounds where water or hydroxyls shield the strong Coulombic interaction between the high charge density polyvalent guest species and the cation and anions of the host structure [307]. Use of aerogels, for example, have resulted in improvement of the intercalation of polyvalent cations into intercalation compounds to the point where gravimetric capacities of the materials approach that of the Li ion within the same material. Electrolytes would be confined to acetonitrile-based electrolytes for good stability, while corrosion would occur in carbonate-based electrolytes. Ca metal electrode in conventional organic electrolytes is apt to form a surface passivation film, which prevents Ca2+ transportation thus leading to irreversible calcium deposition. Although some researchers realized reversible Ca deposition in a molten salt electrolyte, the working temperature is extremely high (550–700 °C) [308], which cannot match the mainstream application conditions. An approach using large, weakly binding anions as demonstrated by Li et al. [190], could enable further progress in the field.

The calculated energy density of ZIBs, assuming Mn-based and V-based cathodes, can reach values of 85 Wh kg-1 and 75 Wh kg-1, respectively using assumptions similar to those for the LIBs [210]. These values are comparable to those of a Ni-MH battery, but lower than the energy densities of LIBs (180–230 Wh kg-1).

Novel high-rate and stable quasi-solid-state zinc-ion battery – with 2D layered zinc orthovanadate array cathode, Zn array anode supported by a conductive porous graphene foam and a gel electrolyte – has been reported [309]. This was the first application of V-based cathode in flexible ZIBs. Hybrid-flexible ZIBs, using lithium manganese oxide (LMO) and lithium iron phosphate (LFP) as cathodes, were also developed further, in which Pluronic hydrogel electrolytes (PHEs) consisting of a Pluronic polymer and an aqueous solution of mixed salts (0.25M ZnSO4 and 0.25M Li2SO4) were used [310]. In this configuration, higher voltages of 1.8 V and 1.18 V vs. Zn2+/Zn can be reached for the hybrid cells Zn/PHE/LMO and Zn/PHE/LFP, respectively. These flexible batteries allowed the demonstration of some ergonomic properties such us a wearable and self- charging system integrated with solar cells; emphasizing the potential of ZIBs in developing parallel market. Al-ion batteries. The early research studies were focused on Al-based primary batteries, with a little attention paid to the rechargeable ones, until advances in nanostructuring of materials have been made. The first Al-ion rechargeable battery is quite recent (2011) compared to other technologies [214], which will require more research work (20 cycles, 273 mAh g-1, Eeq = 0.55V vs. Al3+/Al, ionic liquid medium). In 2015, an ultrafast Al-ion battery was developed using 3D graphitic foam (cathode), Al anode and ionic liquid-based electrolyte [213]. The cell demonstrated high stability (7500 cycles, 2V vs. Al3+/Al) at ultrahigh current densities. Although the (de)intercalation of chloroaluminate anions in the graphite has been clarified, some issues still remain to be solved such as high acidity, impurities, cost of ionic liquids and low energy density. Overall, the electrochemical storage performance of the battery needs to be improved further. Successful aqueous electrolyte-based Al-ion batteries have been presented, but this goes on the price of low voltage, resulting in lower energy density.

Besides rechargeable batteries based on cationic shuttles, novel types of rechargeable batteries with anionic shuttles (Fluoride or chloride) are also under development. The best cycling performances are obtained with solid-state electrolyte operating at high temperatures (150 °C). Efforts are ongoing to improve the energy density and cyclability of the cells, as well as reducing the operating temperature with the appropriate high ion-conducting solid-state electrolyte.

However, the large volume change between charged-discharged states could be a serious factor of limitation, observed in the Li- FeOCl, Mg- FeOCl and Mg- BiOCl electrochemical cells [312]. Further attempts have been followed using a solid polymer electrolyte, demonstrating first all-solid state Cl-ion battery with significant improvements for the working voltage and capacity retention over 20 cycles [313]. 5.3. MH-based batteries In the last 20 years, significant progress has been made for Ni-MH batteries, particularly as concerns self-discharge issues and enhancement of specific energy density of the negative electrode [314,315]. Indeed, the replacement of LaNi5-type electrodes by superlattice A2B4/AB5 alloys brings out higher hydrogen mass capacity (ca. 25%) [236]. These breakthroughs added to the intrinsic safety of Ni-MH batteries (related to the use of aqueous electrolyte) their low cost and their robustness, have led to high penetration of this technology in hybrid HEVs [316]. However, for applications demanding higher energy densities such as full EVs, Ni-MH batteries cannot compete yet with Li-ion ones. This can be noticed in Fig. 11 where performances of Li-ion batteries exceed those of Ni-MH in terms of both gravimetric and volumetric energy density. Figure 11.

Indeed, reversible mass capacity of A2B4/AB5 alloys is limited to ca. 1.5 wt.% (400 mAh g-1) while alternative metal hydrides with much higher capacities exist such as Zr/Ti Laves type alloys (1.9 wt%, 500 mAh g-1), Mg2NiH4 (3.7 wt%, 1000 mAh g-1) or even MgH2 (7.6 wt%, 2000 mAh g-1). However, two latter compounds are made of electropositive metals and contain low or no-content of B-type late transition metals. They are consequently more prone to corrosion in KOH aqueous media. Two solutions are offered to overcome this issue: either using a suitable coating of the MH in the negative electrode or replacing the KOH electrolyte for a lower oxidizing media. For the first one, the coating should be electrochemically active towards water reduction, allowing hydrogen permeation and being mechanically stable upon the cycling of hydrogen charge-discharge. The concept has been successfully applied in Pd-caped Mg-Sc and Mg-Ti thin films providing capacities as high as 1500 mAh g-1 [318,319]. However, to find out efficient low-cost coatings and their implementation in current 3D electrode materials remains a challenge. As for the second solution, a low-corroding electrolyte should be able to guarantee high-capacity redox reactions at both electrodes while providing a good ionic conductivity but no electronic conductivity and preserving the intrinsic safety of Ni-MH batteries. One attractive option is to replace aqueous KOH by proton-conducting ionic liquids as recently proposed by Meng et al. [320]. The other alternative is by dissolving ion- conducting salts in organic solvents. Note that this approach has been used for metal hydrides as negative electrodes in Li-ion batteries [273,274,321], in which Li-ions react reversibly with metal hydrides through a conversion reaction (cf. section 4). The advantage of organic electrolytes is that they enable high-voltage positive electrodes to build-up high voltage batteries. This is the key reason of the higher energy densities of Li-ion batteries as compared to Ni-MH ones (Fig. 11). However, this solution has a", "page": 37, "position": 0}

The design of the suitable post-Li ion batteries will not only depend on electrodes, but also will require their integration in the best cell configuration and assembly, which may involve some engineering work. There is a general agreement that solid-state or gel electrolytes will be closely researched in the field of beyond L-ion batteries, thanks to the safer operation and transportation, higher energy density and long stability of the stacked cells in a wide temperature range. Exploitable batteries involving aqueous electrolytes with long-term cyclability, for instance in Zn and Al batteries, will undoubtedly attract investors, at least for quasi-stationary energy storage. NiMH batteries are continuing supplying rechargeable battery sectors and much progress has been made to integrate them further in electric vehicles and railways. Moreover, a new category of batteries may see the light, using metal hydride incorporated in a LIB (MH-LIB). This configuration has demonstrated a potential for future applications, mainly as solid-state Li/Na battery with high energy density and safety. For all the technologies, careful electrodes optimization and cell design are essential for beyond Li-ion batteries to take advantage of their materials superiority which may surpass the state-of-the-art LIBs. One of the issues in assessing the performance of post-Li ion batteries is the end-of-life energy density which needs to be specified accurately. Besides energy density, interfaces stability, aging/degradation mechanisms and long-term operation of post LIBs in varied conditions must be studied in detail as it is done for the current LIBs; so that the suitable treatment and creative remedies can be proposed in the aim of better performing batteries and low recycling costs.
