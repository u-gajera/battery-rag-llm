(Dated: May 22, 2024) In the pursuit of reliable energy storage solutions, the significance of engineering electrodes cannot be overstated. Previous research has explored the use of surface modifiers (SMs), such as single-side fluorinated graphene, to enhance the thermodynamic stability of ion intercalation when applied atop few-layer graphene (FLG). As we seek alternatives to lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), earth- abundant elements like sodium and potassium have emerged as promising candidates. However, a comprehensive investigation into staging intercalation has been lacking thus far. By delving into staging assemblies, we have uncovered a previously unknown intercalation site that offers the most energetically favorable binding. Here we study the first three elements in both alkali (Li, Na, K) and alkaline (Be, Mg, Ca) earth metals. Furthermore, the precise mechanism underlying this intercalation system has remained elusive in prior studies. In our work, we employed Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations with advanced hybrid functionals to determine the electrical properties at various stages of intercalation. This approach has been proven to yield more accurate and reliable electrical information. Through the analysis of projecting density of states (PDOS) and Mulliken population, we have gained valuable insights into the intricate interactions among the SM, ions, and FLG as the ions progressively insert into the structures. Notably, we expanded our investigation beyond lithium and explored the effectiveness of the SM on ions with varying radii and valence, encompassing six alkali and alkaline earth metals. Additionally, we discovered that the number of graphene layers significantly influences the binding energy.

INTRODUCTION The usage of lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) has become omnipresent in our daily lives, leading to a growing con- cern about potential supply shortages of lithium [1–4]. Consequently, there is a significant focus on developing batteries that are both more efficient and cost-effective [5–9]. One way to address these concerns is by effec- tively utilizing lithium, such as by improving its elec- tric capacity through engineering the electrode materi- als. Carbon-based materials like graphite and few-layer graphene have shown promise in enhancing ion inter- calation [10–14]. In addition to optimizing lithium us- age, researchers are exploring alternative intercalants to lithium, such as sodium and potassium atoms, due to their similar electronic properties [15–19]. These al- ternatives are being investigated as promising options for intercalation within layer-structured electrodes. Fur- thermore, some alternative metals offer more competi- tive prices compared to lithium. For example, sodium and magnesium can be economical alternatives based on their carbonate counterparts [20]. However, these alter- native intercalants present certain challenges that differ ∗jmendoza@msu.edu from those of lithium. These challenges can adversely af- fect the intercalation process and result in reduced stor- age capacity [21–23]. One disadvantage is their larger atomic radius compared to lithium, which introduces an additional energy barrier for intercalation and requires a greater degree of geometric transformation to accommo- date more spacious host sites [13, 24]. Hence, exploring potential alternatives with compara- ble atomic radii provides a new avenue for research. One such alternative is the magnesium atom, which possesses a slightly smaller radius than lithium and can also act as a multivalent ion, thereby enhancing battery capacity by carrying more charge per intercalant. In this study, both electrode engineering and lithium alternatives were inves-", "page": 0, "position": 1}

In this study, both electrode engineering and lithium alternatives were inves- tigated. For the electrodes, the focus was on a fluorinated surface modifier (FSM) applied to the top of few-layer graphene (FLG). While graphenes can serve as electrodes and have demonstrated higher lithium storage capacity than graphite [25–30], sodium (Na) intercalation remains unfavorable [31, 32]. Therefore, various modifications of graphenes, such as defects and surface modifiers, were employed to enhance intercalation and ion transport [33– 38]. One example is fluorine-doped FLG, which capital- izes on the high electronegativity of fluorine to improve capacity [39]. Moreover, fluorinated graphenes can be easily synthesized and possess unique electronic proper- ties [40–42]. These considerations led to the develop- arXiv:2405.12375v1 [cond-mat.mtrl-sci] 20 May 2024", "page": 0, "position": 2}

Building upon our previous work [43], a monolayer of fluorinated graphene on top of four-layer graphene (4LG) has been shown theoreti- cally to enhance the intercalation of lithium, sodium, and potassium atoms within the graphene layers, exhibiting lower binding energies compared to pristine 4LG. This two-dimensional modification not only reinforces lithium intercalation in FLG but also makes the substitution of lithium with other atoms more promising. However, the precise mechanism by which the FSM in- fluences the intercalation capability in FLG remains un- clear and necessitates further investigation. Considering the high electronegativity of fluorine atoms, we propose that the electric potential difference induced by the FSM acts as both the driving force for charge transfer and the stabilizer for the intercalant. To verify this assumption, we computed the electronic properties (e.g., PDOS, Mul- liken analysis) of ion-intercalated FLG with and with- out the FSM, in addition to the relative binding energy. For this purpose, we employed density functional theory (DFT) with the advanced hybrid functional B3LYP-D3, which enables accurate predictions of electronic prop- erties, albeit at a higher computational cost compared to the previously used PBE functional [44]. Moreover, the intercalation mechanism of lithium in carbon-based layers is known to involve a gradual staging process, resulting in ordered intercalation at varying concentra- tions [45–47]. Similarly, potassium (K) and sodium (Na) ion intercalation can be described as staging procedures as well [21, 48, 49].

In this study, we not only discuss different staging structures but also consider how they host intercalants. Interestingly, staging structures with intercalation sites between the FSM and its neigh- boring FLG layer are more likely to be energetically fa- vorable assemblies. This finding underscores the signifi- cance of the FSM, as it not only reduces binding energies but also creates more stable host sites. To extend the scope of the FSM’s applicability, we proceeded to study the intercalation of the first three elements in both alkali and alkaline earth metals within FLG. Our objective was to unravel the interactions be- tween the FSM and ions with varying atomic radii and multivalency. The energetic outcomes revealed that, irre- spective of the type of intercalants, all scenarios involv- ing the FSM exhibited enhanced binding between the intercalants and the graphene substrate.

Additionally, the number of graphene layers emerged as a critical factor affecting the binding energy. Fewer layers in FLG corresponded to lower binding en- ergies, underscoring the significance of FLG exfoliation from graphite when considering electrode materials. In summary, these findings present multiple potential alter- natives to LIBs and shed light on the long-standing am- biguity surrounding surface modifiers and staging inter- calation. Furthermore, the implications of this research extend beyond the realm of batteries, as it offers valuable insights for tuning the stability and electrical properties of layered materials through the application of SMs or by varying the density of intercalants and the number of layers.

Since the slab structures with multiple layers are represented within extended unit cells, the D3 dispersion correction [53–55], accounting for long- range Coulomb correlation and weak London forces, was combined with the B3LYP functional. Specifically, Gaus- sian triple-zeta valence with polarization (TZVP) basis sets [56] was used to represent the orbitals of each ele- ment, and full optimization was performed to adjust both atom positions and unit cell parameters. To prevent in- teractions between cells and simulate surface conditions, a ∼500 ˚A vacuum layer along the z-axis was employed for the slab structures.

HSE06-D3 incorporates a short-range coulombic operator and has demonstrated accurate predictions for metallic materials [61]. The results of cohesive energies based on different functionals were compared (see Figure S1). It is impor- tant to note that the functionals used to calculate each comparative term of binding energy were unified. The calculation of binding energy can be referred to a previ- ous study [43]. Cohesive energy (Ecoh) refers to the energy needed to evaporate an isolated atom from its bulk metal, and it is calculated using equation (1). Ecoh = Egas–Ebulk n (1) Here, n represents the number of atoms in the bulk metal, while Egas and Ebulk correspond to the total energy of an isolated atom and the bulk metal, respectively. III. DISCUSSION The highlights of this study include not only the ap- plicability of FSM to diverse beyond-Li intercalants but also the scheme behind the consequences. The main char- acter and the philosophies around it are illustrated in Figure 1 first. Prior to demonstrating the effectiveness of the FSM, it is crucial to determine the most ther- modynamically stable staging assemblies as a basis for comparison. Since previous studies on staging assem- blies were not exhaustive, this work considers all possi- ble configurations.

Specifically, Figure 2 displays the re- sults for pristine 4LG, while Figure 3 depicts those for fluorinated 4LG.

For pristine 4LG at stage 3, structures with the intercalants located at the edge sites are more likely to form stable bindings. At stage 2, assemblies with intercalants positioned both at the edge and middle sites tend to be more energetically favorable. Notably, the intercalation of lithium and potassium within pris- tine 4LG can be thermodynamically stable even without the assistance of the FSM (Figure 2). This advantage highlights the widespread usage of LIBs in today’s appli- cations and underscores the potential of potassium-ion batteries. Moving to fluorinated 4LG at stage 3, struc- tures with the intercalant closest to the FSM consistently exhibit the lowest binding energies. Interestingly, as the intercalant moves further away from the FSM, the bind- ing energies gradually increase. This observation sug- gests that the FSM can significantly impact conditions with low intercalant concentrations, as the preferred host FIG. 4.

On the other hand, fluorinated 4LG at stage 2 shows various assemblies for the most stable bindings. With a clear understanding of the dominant assem- blies for each element at different stages, a comparison between the intercalation of pristine 4LG and fluorinated 4LG becomes applicable. As shown in Figure 4, the bind- ing energies at each stage decrease significantly with the presence of the FSM, regardless of the element. Remark- ably, while Li and K can spontaneously intercalate into pristine 4LG, the intercalation of Na, Be, Mg, and Ca becomes thermodynamically more favorable when fluo- rinated 4LG is considered. This finding unveils several potential alternatives to LIBs.

For instance, as presented in Table S1, the computed capacities of Na (stage 3: 73; stage 2: 137; stage 1: 194 mAhg−1) and Ca (stage 3: 139; stage 2: 252; stage 1: 346 mAhg−1) ion intercalation in fluorinated 4LG are substantially larger than the experimentally found capacities (Na: 34; Ca: 97 mAhg−1) in graphitic electrodes [62, 63]. On the other hand, the computed capacity of K-ion intercalation in pristine 4LG at stage 1, which already exhibits favorable binding energy, aligns well with the experimental result (∼200 mAhg−1) [64]. This study not only considers intercalant assemblies but also expands the range of alternatives to LIBs. How- ever, the role of FSM in this context remains to be eluci- dated. Therefore, to deepen our understanding of the un- derlying mechanism, we investigate the electronic prop- erties. Specifically, we focus on the redistribution of elec- trons and the electron pathways between each element in the system with FSM. Mulliken analysis was employed to gain insights into the electron distribution. As de- picted in Figure 5, the fluorine in the FSM gains elec- trons, while the carbon connected to that fluorine loses electrons. This phenomenon can be attributed to the ul- trahigh electronegativity of fluorine, which tends to draw electrons. Moreover, in the presence of intercalants, the fluorine and F-connected carbon show an increased ten- dency to gain and lose electrons, respectively, compared to fluorinated 4LG without any intercalant. However, the net electron of fluorine and F-connected carbon is nega- tive, leading to the transfer of those missing electrons to FIG. 6.

Regarding the intercalants, Figure 6 illustrates the aver- aged valence of intercalants at each stage. The valence of alkali metals ranges from 0 to 0.45, while that of al- kaline earth metals ranges from 1 to 1.3. Notably, Li shows limited participation in charge transfer with oth- ers in the system, rendering it nearly neutral compared to other types of intercalants. This observation suggests that the intercalation of Li within FLG relies on covalent bonds, while the other intercalants primarily form ionic bonds with negatively charged non-fluorinated carbons. Covalent bonds, held together by electrostatic forces be- tween shared electrons and nuclei, require less energy to form than ionic bonds, partially accounting for the ad- vantage of lithium-ion intercalation. Interestingly, with FSM, other intercalants at stage 3 tend to retain more electrons (lower valence) compared to higher intercalant concentration stages (stage 2 and stage 1). This behav- ior aligns with the previous finding that the FSM plays a more effective role at low ion concentration stages, as", "page": 4, "position": 1}

To shed light on this aspect, electron density of states (DOS) can offer valuable information by indicating the presence of adequate electron channels based on the overlap of DOS. Figure S2 and 7 repre- sent the elemental PDOS, illustrating the DOS of each element. In the case of pristine 4LG, Figure S2 reveals a clear overlap between carbon and each intercalant, and as the system approaches higher intercalant concentrations from stage 3 to stage 1, this overlap gradually increases. A similar phenomenon is observed in the intercalation of fluorinated 4LG, as shown in Figure 7, indicating the existence of electron channels between carbon and in- tercalants. However, fluorinated 4LG offers additional channels, not limited to intercalant-carbon interactions, but also open to intercalant-fluorine and carbon-fluorine interactions. This suggests that, with the assistance of the FSM, electron transfer can exhibit greater flexibility, leading to a more stable ground state and lower bind- ing energy. Specifically, the overlap of DOS with FSM around the Fermi energy level, which is more likely to be occupied by electrons, tends to be greater compared to that of pristine 4LG. Furthermore, the positive impact of FSM on ion in- tercalation in FLG is not the only contributing factor; the dimension of FLG also plays a significant role. To illustrate this, a comparison of binding energies for Li, Na, and Mg between 4LG and 5LG with FSM is shown in Figure 8. Given that the configurations of each stage differ between 4LG and 5LG, the intercalant concentra- tion was considered instead of the stage. Similar to 4LG, FSM in 5LG proves to be more effective at lower ion con- centrations and in staging assemblies with intercalants positioned close to it, as depicted in Figure 8 and Fig- ure S4, respectively.

Additionally, the binding energy in 5LG gradually increases as the intercalant concentration rises. However, it is noteworthy that the intercalation within fluorinated 4LG outperforms that of fluorinated 5LG, as it requires less energy for binding at each stage. This finding provides a valuable clue for practical energy storage applications, suggesting that a higher degree of graphitic exfoliation for graphene could further enhance the capacity of FLG electrodes. IV. CONCLUSION In conclusion, this comprehensive study thoroughly ex- plores the application of fluorinated FLG in diverse ion intercalations (Li, Na, K, Be, Mg, and Ca) by consid- ering staging assemblies, electronic properties, and di- mensions. By comparing the binding energies of staging configurations, we found that FSM proves to be remark- ably effective in facilitating intercalation at low ion con- centrations. Notably, the most preferable host layer at stage 3 is located beneath FSM, and as the intercalant moves farther away from FSM, the binding energy gradu- ally increases. This trend applies to all six types of ions. Most importantly, FSM was observed to either reverse nonspontaneous intercalations (Na, Be, Mg, and Ca) or further facilitate spontaneous interactions (Li and K) at each stage, opening up possibilities for multiple potential alternatives to LIBs. Moreover, our electronic analysis sheds light on the mechanism of FSM-assisted interca- lation. Specifically, the Mulliken analysis suggests that Li-ion intercalation may involve covalent bonds, while other intercalants tend to undergo ionic interactions with significant charge transfer. Additionally, based on the PDOS, FSM creates additional channels for flexible elec- tron transfer, enabling the system to reach a more stable ground state. Furthermore, we found that the number of layers can influence the theoretical capacity of FLG. In- tercalation in fluorinated 4LG was observed to be more thermodynamically stable than in fluorinated 5LG. In summary, this", "page": 6, "position": 1}
