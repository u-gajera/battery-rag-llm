The significant challenges in advancing Sodium Ion Battery (NIB) technologies lies in finding the better electrode materials. Experimental investigations revealed the real potency of Germanium (Ge) as suitable anode materials for NIBs. However, a systematic atomistic study is necessary to understand the fundamental aspects of capacity-voltage correlation, microstructural changes of Ge, as well as diffusion kinetics. We, therefore, performed the Density Functional Theory (DFT) and Ab Initio Molecular Dynamics (AIMD) simulation to investigate the sodiation-desodiation kinetics in Germanium-Sodium system (Na64Ge64). We analyzed the intercalation potential and capacity correlation for intermediate equilibrium structures and compared our data with the experimental results. Effect of sodiation on inter-atomic distances within Na-Ge system is analyzed by means of Pair Correlation Function (PCF). This provides insight into possible microstructural changes taking place during sodiation of amorphous Ge (a-Ge). We further investigated the diffusivity of sodium in a-Ge electrode material and analyzed the volume expansion trend for Na64Ge64 electrode system.

INTRODUCTION The periodic increment in the global energy demand is keeping researchers busy recognizing the potential energy materials for safe, efficient and inexpensive energy storage. With the imminent exhaustion of fossil fuel and its subsequent environmental consequences, there has been enormous demand for eco-friendly, renewable, cheap, and portable secondary battery that could provide energy storage for variable applications. In past few decades, Li-ion batteries (LIBs) have ruled the market as leading battery technology owing to their high-energy density, long cycle life, and lightweight.1-3 They have been the primary source of power in portable electronic devices and electric vehicles. However, with the ever-increasing demand for LIBs, there have been concerns about depleting Lithium (Li) reserves and the cost associated with this technology. Alternatively, Sodium (Na) being the fourth most abundant element on earth, offers a potential rechargeable electrochemical energy storage (EES) in the form of Na-ion battery (NIB).4-7 Moreover, Na is cheaper and has its redox potential closer to that of Li (Eo (Na+/Na) = -2.71V).8 All these advantages make NIB a real alternative to LIB. Although Na is heavier than Li, resulting comparatively lower energy density than LIBs, it is a small penalty to pay for safer, cheaper, abundant, and rechargeable energy storage system. Concerning battery components and electrical storage mechanisms, NIB is very similar to LIB; the only exception lies in their ion carriers. The difference in ion carriers, i.e., Na being bigger and heavier as compared to Li, is what makes a difference in intercalation mechanism and transport phenomenon in the battery systems.9 Na, being in the same group as Li and possessing similar chemical behavior, shows identical diffusion kinetics and comparable diffusion barriers as that of its Li counterpart while combined with solid state host materials.10 Similar charge/discharge profiles are reported for NIBs and LIBs except for some different plateau observed in NIB due to Na size induced strain effects.4 Na being bigger in size offers sluggish transport, and therefore, it has been reported that LIB electrodes tend to exhibit better cycle stability. Since capacity and cell cycle are primarily determined by electrodes, it becomes essential", "page": 1, "position": 0}

To the best of our knowledge, on the contrary to the positive electrode research, negative electrodes for NIB are less explored and are still open to proper investigation. The existing studies lack the detailed understanding of the bulk and interfacial properties of the systems. An efficient anode material for NIB with significant capacity, charge/discharge rate, and enhanced cycle life is still a challenge. Initially, crystalline carbonaceous anode such as graphite was investigated as a potential electrode material for NIB owing to their success as the anode in LIB,15 but the degree of Na intercalation through graphite framework was found to be negligible due to its larger diameter.16-18 To overcome this, Wen et al.19 put forward expanded graphite with large interlayer spacing as an anode material for NIB that could ease Na+ ion intercalation and provides the decent capacity of 150 mAhg-1. However, such structures are synthesized via oxidation of Graphene followed by partial reduction which results in the residual oxygen-containing groups in the interlayers. These oxygen-containing groups hinder Na+ ion intercalation and therefore affecting the overall efficiency of the electrode.19 Henceforth, focus shifted towards the disordered carbonaceous materials such as hard carbon and metal oxides such as titanium-based oxides20-21. These materials were found to exhibit better reversibility during electrochemical processes in NIBs and provide comparatively high specific capacities. Table 1 lists some of the anode materials with their specific capacities as reported in the respective literature. It has been studied that heteroatom doping in carbonaceous materials significantly improves its specific capacity by creating defect sites which eventually facilitates Na+ absorption and charge transfer process. 22 For example, sulfur(S)-doped carbon exhibited very high specific capacity of 516 mAhg-1.

Si has been one of the most extensively studied anode material for NIB due to its enormous success in case of LIBs. All forms of Si have been probed for their potential as the anode in NIBs. Initially, crystalline Si (c-Si) was investigated for Na diffusion kinetics, and it was reported that in spite of being chemically similar to Li, Na intercalation in c-Si is limited because of its bigger size. Bulk Si has been computationally investigated to have a very high energy barrier (1.41 eV) for Na diffusion.38 Kulish et al.39 investigated layered Si such as polysilane as an anode for NIB. They showed by means of DFT and Nudge Elastic Band (NEB) method that energy barrier for Na diffusion in such compounds gets reduced to 0.41 eV, but these materials exhibit low capacity of 279 mAhg-1.39 Failure of layered Si motivated the intense investigations of a-Si, where again Na displayed very low diffusivity that makes it an impractical choice.33 All of this trial experimentation leaves researchers with the most viable option of considering Ge, as the potential host material for Na+ ions due to its vast similarities with the Li-Si system. Like Si, Ge too takes up one Na per atom to form Na-Ge alloy.24 Theoretical capacity for the Na- Ge system have been reported to be 369 mAhg-1, which may be lower than other alloys but is still better than C-based and TMOs/TMSs anodes.34 Furthermore, Na-Ge anode is known to undergo comparatively lower volume expansion than other available alternatives. This makes Ge a promising anode material for NIB. However, unlike Si, Ge is not well studied and requires thorough investigations from both the experimental and theoretical point of view in order to gain more insights.

COMPUTATIONAL DETAILS The first principle calculations were done using Vienna Ab Initio Simulation Package (VASP).41 The optimized equilibrium structures were obtained via DFT as implemented in VASP. PAW pseudopotentials42 were taken for the inert core electrons, and valence electrons were represented by plane-wave basis set. The GGA, with the PBE (Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof) exchange-correlation functionals were taken into account.43 All DFT relaxation includes force, geometric, volume, and cell shape relaxations until the minimum energy criteria of 1.0×10-4 eV was met. All the internal coordinates are relaxed until the Hellmann-Feynman forces are less than 0.02 eV/Å. Plane wave cutoff for all the calculations was taken as 230 eV following high precision convergence as described in VASP and was tested accordingly. The Brillouin zone was sampled with 1×2×1 mesh in Monkhorst pack grid. Initially, we investigated the intercalation of Na through c-Ge64 at various elevated temperatures (below the melting point of Ge). We intended to model alloy anode starting with c- Ge64. However, we discovered that Na, due to its larger diameter, does not intercalate into the c- Ge64 lattice. So, a-Ge was considered for our study. In order to model a-Ge64, we started from c- Ge64 and generated a-Ge64 via computational quenching process. The quenching process is a combined AIMD and DFT relaxations involving heating, cooling and equilibration for significant amount of time steps (in this case 5000MD time steps with 1 fs time interval). In our study, the highest and lowest temperatures for the AIMD run were 5000K and 298 K (room temperature). Finally, a-Ge64 was obtained via further DFT optimization of the room temperature AIMD simulated lowest energy (local minima) Ge64 structure.

The reason behind the consideration of this particular stoichiometry is the similar volumetric energy density of Na-Ge system with Li-Si system. Later has been studied with the 1:1 atomic ratio which motivated us to do the same.44 Previous DFT study to model a-Ge as an anode for NIB employed Na:Ge ratio greater than 1 which is not experimentally found.45 Their reported theoretical specific capacity value is 576 mAhg-1, which is much greater than the experimentally feasible capacity for Ge anode.46 The ratio taken in the present study gave specific capacity (369 mAhg-1) for a-Ge anode closer to experimentally and theoretically investigated capacities.34, 40 The formation of mixed Na64Ge64 alloy failed initially when c-Ge64 was considered as the precursor. Alternatively, consideration of a-Ge64 as the precursor in this mixing process facilitates the Na penetration through the amorphous network. Na64Ge64 mixed system was generated via incorporation of 64 Na atoms into a-Ge64 using AIMD simulation. Again RDF was used to determine the phase of the final alloy mixture.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Initial investigation of c-Ge64 as alloy anode material for NIB was not successful as Na does not intercalate into the c-Ge64 lattice due to its larger diameter. This is because of the fact that c- Ge64 has similar crystal lattice structure to c-Si (Diamond FCC). Both the crystal structures have lattice constants very close in value (565.75 ppm for c-Ge and 543.09 ppm for c-Si) while atomic radii of Ge is significantly larger than Si. This makes c-Ge even less suitable material for Na intercalation than c-Si which has already been reported to have very limited Na intercalating tendency.38 a-Ge64 was then modeled starting from c-Ge64 via computational quenching process as described in computational section. One of the important observation was that the Na atoms were mixed easily with a-Ge64 than with c-Ge64. At the end of the room temperature AIMD simulation followed by the DFT optimization, we were able to achieve completely mixed Na64Ge64 alloy.

Tracing such equilibrium Voltage vs. Capacity curve is the essential part of an electrochemical process as it not only gives the idea about battery performance but also provides insight into significant structural or phase change phenomenon happening during the process. In order to compute intercalation potential, we started from the Na64Ge64 system and obtained the intermediate NanGe64 structures by removing 4 Na atoms (~6.25%) at a time, where n varies from 0 to 64. After modeling the initial structures for all of the NanGe64 phases, they were fully relaxed until the energy minimized structures were obtained. The potential value of each of these corresponding structures was computed by implementing the equation 2. Figure 2(a) depicts the potential curve obtained for intermediate NanGe64 phases for the Na-Ge system. In Figure 2 (a), it is seen that voltage profile ranges from 2.08 V to 0.48 V. As Na concentration increases, there is a gradual potential drop until n = 16 (92 mAhg-1 capacity) which then reduces upon further Na incorporation. There is a rise in voltage vs capacity curve at around 100 mAhg-1 (when n = 20). Such ‘voltage spike’ is seen when there is a small energy difference in total energy of similar neighboring phases. When Na concentration reaches up to 50% (n = 32, 150 mAhg-1 capacity), potential drop seems to become insignificant, and a plateau- like curve is noticeable henceforth. These kinds of the plateau are also indicative of the existence of single-phase system inside the battery during the electrochemical process. This stability of single phase (for Na > 50%), i.e., the plateau-like curve is in contrast with initial voltage jumps and spikes in the curve, where Na concentration (n = 20) is less.

However, during the DFT relaxation at different Na concentrations, a little different trend was observed regarding the volume change.

There is a subsequent Brownian motion in the system causing mixing of Na atoms, and hence there is overall volume expansion noted for the system. This hypothesis is supported by Na-Ge interatomic distances measured for various Na concentrations. There were significant variations seen for short-range atomic distances for small Na concentrations. The nearest average neighboring distance for 6% Na content (n= 4) was 3.327 Å, while for 19% Na content, it was 3.193 Å.

Diffusivity of Na in amorphous Ge Another critical feature that is important for battery performance is fast diffusion kinetics of Na in anode material. Diffusivity determines the ability of Na to mix with the anode material and charge/discharge rates of the battery. Importance of diffusivity study is evident from the fact that Si, being the most promising anode material for NIB due to its high capacity and low volume expansion, cannot be practically applied to NIB owing to the sluggish diffusivity of Na in Si. 38 As reported, Na diffusion encounters energy barrier of 1.41 eV in bulk-Si. Therefore, it becomes crucial to extensively study the diffusion kinetics of Na in Ge, as it is one of the essential criteria concerning choosing a suitable anode. Diffusivity of Na in Ge was determined by calculating average MSD (equation 6) of single Na in bulk a-Ge64 as a function of MD time step at different temperatures. There is a previous report46 on Na diffusivity in a-Ge at very high temperatures (above the melting point of Ge). However, such high-temperature calculations are not suitable for a proper fundamental understanding of the diffusion kinetics44 occurring in batteries. In our present study, the simulation temperatures are below the melting point of Ge (1200 K).

The linear increment in MSD plot with time and the increasing temperature is evident from our calculation. It was observed during AIMD run that diffusion of Na in a-Ge was slower at first and impeded by Na size, but with increasing time step, it shows gradual increment. The Einstein equation was implemented to calculate the diffusivity of Na in Ge (DNa) at various temperatures (Table 2), which was then extrapolated to room temperature (300K) using Arrhenius equation for diffusivity (equation 7).44 We calculated DNa value for the Na1Ge64 system to be about 4.876´10-9 cm2/s at 300 K. This magnitude is comparable to reported data for Lithium diffusivity in graphite anodes which is of about 10-8 to 10-10 cm2s-1. 48 This shows that Na atoms diffuse in Ge faster than in other alloying anode materials by about one order of magnitude.33 An Arrhenius plot (lnD vs 1000/T) for Na1Ge64 system is shown in figure 5(b). Such plot provides an estimate of migration activation energy for Na in a-Ge. Migration activation energy was derived to be 0.709 eV, which compares well with currently applicable LIBs 48 and thus holds a promise of good charge/discharge rate in Na-Ge anode based NIB. This activation energy for Na in a-Ge is calculated from single atom diffusion model. However, diffusivity is expected to increase with Na concentration as it is established that dopant-dopant interaction (Na-Na in this case) significantly lowers the energy barrier by causing additional relaxation of surrounding atoms.38 So, one can expect higher overall diffusivity in case of the Na64Ge64 system due to the presence of higher Na concentration during the process of charging and discharging. However, the theoretical activation energy for Na hopping in c-Ge has been reported to be 1.5 eV 10, which is very high and thus explains the impedance Na faced when we tried Na diffusion in c-Ge which is apparently due to the large size of Na.", "page": 15, "position": 0}

From our first principle results, we also computed the volume expansion of Na-Ge alloy electrode to be approximately 149.51% in the fully sodiated state (Na64Ge64). It is well established that in Na-Ge battery system, starting with a-Ge, upon complete sodiation results in an amorphous system (Na64Ge64). However, not much information about the intermediate stages of Na-Ge system exists. In the present study, intermediate Na concentrations (6%, 19%, 31%, 50%, 69% and 88%) in Na-Ge system were assessed to identify any possible phase change during sodiation. We found that in spite of starting and final stable amorphous phases, system undergoes minute phase transitions to crystallinity for smaller Na concentrations (Na < 20%). This information was revealed in PCF analysis of Na-Na pairs in the system. While PCF of Ge- Ge pairs showed amorphous nature throughout, we observed peaks referring to crystallinity in Na-Na PCF plot for Na concentration below 20%. It was noted that after 50% sodiation, system was amorphous throughout. Moreover, we studied diffusivity of Na in a-Ge and found the energy barrier for diffusion of Na in a-Ge to be much lower as compared to crystalline Ge (c- Ge). We calculated diffusivity of single Na in a-Ge64 to be 4.876´10-9 cm2/s at 300 K, which is greater than previously reported diffusivities of Na in other group 14 and 15 elements. Our systematic investigation yields in-depth insight into the sodiation kinetics and provides guidelines for experimentalists for optimal design of Ge-based NIB for real-life applications.
