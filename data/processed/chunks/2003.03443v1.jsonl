The evolution of “cathode electrolyte interphase” (CEI) ﬁlms, partly or completely consisting of elec- trolyte decomposition products, has also recently been demonstrated to be correlated with battery cycling behavior at high potentials. Using Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations, the hybrid PBE0 functional, and the (001) surfaces of spinel oxides as models, we examine these two interre- lated processes. Consistent with previous calculations, ethylene carbonate (EC) solvent molecules are predicted to be readily oxidized on the LixMn2O4 (001) surface at modest operational voltages, forming adsorbed organic fragments. Further oxidative decompostion of such CEI fragments to release CO2 gas is however predicted to require higher voltages consistent with LixNi0.5Mn1.5O4 (LNMO) at smaller x values. We argue that multi-step reactions, involving ﬁrst formation of CEI ﬁlms and then further oxidization of CEI at higher potentials, are most relevant to capacity fade. Mechanisms associated with dissolution or oxidation of native Li2CO3 ﬁlms, which is removed before the electrolyte is in contact with oxide surfaces, are also explored. I. INTRODUCTION The use of high voltage cathode materials like LiMn1.5Ni0.5O4 spinel (LNMO) can contribute to sig- niﬁcant increase in energy densities in lithium ion batteries.1–4 Energy stored in batteries scale as ∆V 2, where ∆V is the voltage diﬀerence between anode and cathode. LNMO can operate at ∼4.7-5.0 V vs. Li+/Li(s). High nickel content layered lithium nickel/manganese/cobalt (NMC) oxides also have the po- tential to expand the voltage window. One obstacle facing the deployment of high voltage cathode materials is the apparent anodic instability of organic solvent molecules found in standard electrolytes (Fig 1), such as ethylene carbonate (EC) and dimethyl carbonate (DMC).5 EC", "page": 0, "position": 0}

One obstacle facing the deployment of high voltage cathode materials is the apparent anodic instability of organic solvent molecules found in standard electrolytes (Fig 1), such as ethylene carbonate (EC) and dimethyl carbonate (DMC).5 EC and DMC oxidation has been proposed to lead to formation of thin cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) ﬁlms.1,6–17 While the existence of CEI ﬁlms on cathode surfaces has long been conﬁrmed at modest voltages,12–14,17 questions remain about the ori- gin of CEI species.18,19 Although extensive spectroscopic and imaging studies have been conducted, the struc- ture and function of CEI on cathode oxide material sur- faces remain poorly understood. To complicate mat- ters, transition metal ion dissolution from cathode ox- ide surfaces20 and surface phase transformation of lay- ered cathode oxides to form rock salts21,22 can occur at the same time. Protective coating has been applied with some success.23–28 Electrolytes tailored for high voltages can also circumvent this problem,7,8,29 often at the cost of higher electrolyte viscosity and material expense.

CO2 release from layered NMC occurs at lower potentials and has been linked to reactive oxygen release.43 Regarding theoretical modeling, anion-mediated EC oxidation has been predicted to occur in bulk solu- tions at about 5 V potentials.50,51 EC is also pre- dicted to undergo a one-step CO2 release reaction on LNMO (001) surfaces.52 However, there is substantial computational evidence that EC and DMC molecules al- ready react with cathode oxide surfaces at more modest voltages,53–63,63–65 especially on the surfaces of nickel- free manganese spinels (LiMn2O4, or LMO) which do not normally operate beyond ∼4.3 V. Strictly speaking, the predicted reactions are interfacial. Long range elec- tron transfer into the liquid electrolyte is not yet pre- dicted; instead direct contact between electrolyte and oxide surfaces is required.66 These predictions are incon- sistent with the view that high voltages are needed to oxidize the electrolyte. Based on these computational and experimental ﬁnd- ings, we adopt an alternative view of high voltage cathode interfacial reactions which has already been suggested for oxidation on Pt surfaces16 (Fig. 1a). (1) Solvent molecules in standard organic battery electrolyte ﬁrst re- act with cathode oxide surfaces at modest voltages during charging. This occurs even on non-high-voltage materials like LixMn2O4. The oxidation generates adsorbed frag- ments which, to some extent, “passivates” surface reac- tion sites. (2) At higher voltages during charging, these CEI products become oxidized and are removed, releas- ing CO2 gas and leading to uncontrolled further elec- trolyte decomposition. We argue that the latter event is more responsible for rapid capacity fade (Fig. 1a). In this work, solvent decomposition products previ- ously predicted to adsorb on LMO53,54 constitute our “CEI” model components.

Indeed, PF− 6 decomposi- tion products have been suggested to partially passivate LNMO.42 We apply Density Functional Theory calculations to illustrate the hypothesis (Fig. 1a). We adopt the (001) surfaces of LMO and high voltage spinel LNMO as model systems, and compute the thermodynamics and kinet- ics associated with degradation reactions. First we re- examine the initial EC oxidation steps53 using the hybrid PBE0 functional,67 which is generally more accurate for reaction barriers68,69 than the DFT+U method70 widely used in the literature,53–65 but is far more computation- ally costly. Next we consider the further oxidation of these initial products on LNMO, and show that lower Li and higher Ni contents, which correspond to higher voltages, are needed to lower the reaction barriers suf- ﬁciently to activate further reactions that release CO2. Due to the computational cost, PBE0 is only used to ex- amine the key reaction steps. One key ﬁnding is that DFT+U can signiﬁcantly underestimate reaction barri- ers compared to PBE0, yielding qualitative changes in mechanistic interpretations. Online electrochemical mass spectroscopy (OEMS) measurements are also conducted to support the theoretical results. Other cathode interfacial evolution phenomena are re- lated to the above discussions. First, the native Li2CO3 ﬁlm covering most as-synthesized cathode oxide mate- rials must somehow disappear or be ruptured before the elcetrolyte can react with them. It is widely ac- cepted that native Li2CO3 ﬁlms readily form on cath- ode oxide surfaces upon exposure to CO2 in air after synthesis.71 Li2CO3 is known to be oxidized to yield CO2 at ∼4.2 V71,73 or above.74 The carbonate content on CEI ﬁlms on layered NMC has indeed", "page": 1, "position": 1}

Another interesting phenomenon is one version of “cross- talk” where SEI fragments diﬀuse from the anode to the cathode18,19 and become oxidized.34 Cross-talk products have variable structures,19 and they will not be consid- ered herein. However, the principles and methods used in this work can also apply to study this phenomenon. II. METHODS We estimate mean reaction rates using the standard transition state theory rate equation 1/tave = ko exp(−∆E∗/kBT ), (1) where ∆E∗is the activation energy, ko=1012/s is a stan- dard kinetic prefactor, and kBT is the thermal energy at room temperature. Any step in the proposed reaction mechanisms is considered favorable if it is exothermic (∆E<0) and if tave is less than one hour – which trans- lates into ∆E∗<∼1 eV.38 Eq. 1 assumes T=0 K and ig- nores entropy which is small in most cases. As will be discussed, in a few relevant cases gas phase translational or vibrational entropic eﬀects are added post-processing. ∆E and ∆E∗are computed using T=0 K static ultra- high vacuum (UHV) condition DFT calculations, con- ducted using periodically replicated simulation cells and 2", "page": 1, "position": 2}

Most DFT calculations herein apply the Perdew- Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) functional79 with the Hubbard (DFT+U) augmentation.70 The U and J values as- sociated with DFT+U depend on the orbital projec- tion scheme and DFT+U implementation details; here (U −J) =4.84 eV, 5.96, and 3.30 eV for Mn, Ni, and Co in accordance with the iterature.80–83 Co-based ma- terials are discussed only in the S.I. The PBE functional that underlies DFT+U calculations tends to underesti- mate reaction barriers68 because of localization errors.69 The hybrid PBE0 functional, generally considered more accurate than PBE for barriers,68 is applied to key reac- tion steps as spot checks.67 Although fewer in number, these PBE0 calculations constitute the main results in this work. See the S.I. for rationale for choosing PBE0 over other hybrid functionals. In slab geometry DFT+U calculations, the standard dipole correction is applied.84 It is found that this correction is on the order of meV, and it is omitted in PBE0 calculations. Reaction barriers (∆E∗) are computed using the climb- ing image nudged elastic band (NEB) method.85 PBE0- based NEB calculations require far more ionic steps than DFT+U NEB. The reason is that, in the relevant oxida- tive reactions, protons and e−are transferred simulta- neously. The (spatial) radius of convergence associated with PBE0 NEB is small because the e−being transfered is more localized than in DFT+U predictions. Therefore good initial guesses are needed to converge PBE0 NEB. Using DFT+U NEB conﬁgurations as guesses routinely fails to yield PBE0 barriers. 2×2×2 and 2×2×1 Brillouin zone sampling schemes are adopted for LMO and LNMO bulk and surface unit cells.

The slight re- duction in the Ni/Mn ratio in our LNMO surface models, compared to the canonical LixNi0.5Mn1.5O4, is the result of using a fairly thin slab. For the 1×1 (001) surface cells used, PBE0 is up to 100 times more costly than DFT+U for each ion step. Therein lies the advantage of using a small surface cell: the PBE0 functional can be applied more readily. Fur- thermore, the energies of all conﬁgurations with diﬀerent Ni positions can be enumerated (at least when using the DFT+U method). With x ≈1 (i.e., under synthetic conditions), it is most energetically favorable to have one Ni on each surface and two Ni in the interior. To check system size eﬀects, some DFT+U calculations as- sociated with the oxidation of EC fragments apply 1×2 surface supercells along with 2×1×1 Brillouin sampling. These results, and justiﬁcation for using a single adsorbed molecule at T=0 K to model anodic decomposition, are discussed in the S.I. DFT+U-based vibrational frequency calculations are conducted to conﬁrm that one of the conﬁgurations pre- dicted to be a transition state (TST) indeed has only one unstable mode. The frozen phonon method is applied, with only the EC fragment allowed to move. In other words, oxide ions are assumed to be inﬁnitely heavy.

For added veriﬁcation, the maxi- mally localized Wannier orbitial method89 is applied to locate the center of all occupied orbitals within 0.3 ˚A of each transition metal ion. By counting the number of oc- cupied d-Wannier orbitals centered around each Mn/Ni, the charge state can be unambiguously assigned. Regarding experiments: for making the composite elec- trodes, a uniform slurry was prepared by mixing 84% LNMO, 6% CMC, and 10% C65. The contents were thoroughly mixed using Thinky Mixer (ARV-310/ARV- 310LED) at 2000 rpm and 40 kPa for 3 minutes. The prepared slurry was then coated on a clean and polished Al foil using a doctor’s blade adjusted for 60 µm thick- ness. The coated sheet of aluminum foil was then heated at 100oC followed by rolling to ensure complete removal of trapped air or solvent.

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS A. Revisiting EC oxidation on LMO using DFT/PBE0 Our previous computational work,53,54 using the DFT+U method, has shown that ethylene carbonate (EC) decomposition occurs readily on LMO (001) and (111). In particular, 40% charged LMO (Li0.6Mn2O4) already oxidizes EC molecules on its (001) surface. The rate-determining, oxidative step releases ∆E=- 2.0 eV. The reaction barrier is predicted to be only ∆E∗=0.56 eV. According to Eq. 1, a reaction with this small ∆E∗occurs in millisecond time scales. Thus Li0.6Mn2O4, which should operate below 4.3 V, is pre- dicted to rapidly oxidize EC molecules. Higher voltages are not needed. The more accurate PBE0 mehthod has also been used to calculate ∆E.53 However, PBE0 reac- tion barriers (∆E∗) have not been previously reported. Fig. 2 describes new PBE0 ∆E∗predictions com- puted using the climbing image nudged elastic band method (NEB).85 First Fig. 2a depicts an intact EC on LMO (001) surface. Fig. 2b-d depict the initial, ﬁ- nal, and barrier conﬁgurations associated with the rate- determining oxidative step in the initial decomposition of EC molecules. Two e−and a H+ are transferred. ∆E is −1.75 eV, which is only 0.25 eV less exothermic than the DFT+U value.53 ∆E∗at the barrier top (Fig. 2d) is found to be 1.05 eV higher in energy than Fig. 1b. This PBE0 ∆E∗is 0.49 eV larger than DFT+U value,", "page": 3, "position": 0}

This PBE0 ∆E∗is 0.49 eV larger than DFT+U value, in accordance with our expectation that PBE0 barriers are generally higher.68 This PBE0 ∆E∗value should be more accurate.68 1.05 eV is still consistent with a fast degrada- tion reaction at room temperature, especially because the large zero point energy (ZPE) correction associated with proton motion has so far been neglected. ZPE contribu- tion at T=300 K can be estimated using DFT+U conﬁg- urations, DFT+U frozen phonon calculations which yield a single unstable vibrational mode at the transition state, and Eq. 2. We ﬁnd that ZPE lowers ∆E∗(or more ap- propriately ∆G∗, the free energy barrier) by 0.16 eV, to only 0.89 eV. This value is consistent with 4 reactions per hour (Eq. 1), well within battery time scales. We conclude that CEI products readily form on moderate voltage LMO (001). Given the cost of PBE0 barrier calculations, we have not performed the same two e−, one H+ transfer calcu- lation on LNMO (001). Since LNMO operates at higher voltages, and should yield more exothermic, faster reac- tions than corresponding ones on LMO, it is reasonable to assume the reactions of Fig. 2 also readily occur on LNMO (001) at the same Li-content. B. Further Oxidation on LMO and LNMO: DFT+U Predictions As discussed in Ref. 53, eﬀorts to break other bonds in this partially oxidized EC fragment (Fig. 2c) have yielded endothermic reactions. Hence this fragment has been as- sumed to persist during battery charging. However, a hitherto unexamined pathway proves favorable when us- ing the DFT+U method.

We rotate this organic fragment so one of its H-atoms faces the oxide surface, remove one more Li to partially oﬀset the implicit voltage decrease due to transfer of e− from EC to the oxide, and use the resulting conﬁguration (Fig. 3b) as the re-starting point.

Breaking this bond leads to the release of both a CO2 and a glyoxal (C2H2O2) molecule (Fig. 3e). Without the prior H-atom transfer step, CO2 elimination would have been accompanied by the release of a CHOCH2O radical, which is less energetically favorable, although a similar reaction appears favorable on LNMO,52 not LMO. It results in a 4-coordinated Mn(II) ion in Fig. 3e. The DFT+U-predicted barrier conﬁguration (Fig. 3f) ex- hibits ∆E∗=0.46 eV relative to Fig. 3c, and has a 1.95 ˚A C-O bond length.

The main problem with these DFT+U results is that the predicted ∆E and ∆E∗for reactions on LNMO sur- faces are similar to those on LMO (Fig. 4a). Both oxida- tion steps subsequent to the LNMO equivalent of Fig. 3c are exothermic, and the average reaction times are much less than one hour. With all adsorbed organic fragments removed from their surfaces, LMO and LNMO should continuously react with solvent molecules and evolve CO2 at LMO operating potentials (< 4.3 V). Experimentally, CO2 release is observed with LNMO at high voltage, but not with LMO at lower voltages after the ﬁrst cycle.42–49 DFT+U fails to distinguish LMO spinel and high-voltage LNMO spinel. Doubling the size the the simulation cell and adding more EC molecular fragments does not re- solve this discrepancy between modeling and experiments (S.I.). The absence of molecular fragments on the cath- ode oxide at intermdediate voltages also seems incon- sistent with two apparent CO2 onset potentails42 (see Sec. III D below). C. Further Oxidation on LMO and LNMO: PBE0 Predictions The PBE0 method is next applied to key reaction steps to distinguish LNMO from LMO. The PBE0-predicted conﬁgurations are qualitatively similar to those in Fig. 3, and are depicted only in a few cases. But the energetics are substantially diﬀerent (Fig. 4b).

The two-sided arrows indicate the two key diﬀerences between (a) DFT+U and (b) PBE0. PBE0 predicts that the ﬁnal reaction on Li0.5Ni0.5Mn1.5O4 has a much higher ∆E∗than DFT+U, and that ∆E for the ﬁnal reaction on Li0.5Mn2O4 is much more unfavorable than DFT+U. for the purpose of modeling further oxidizing reactions, we should remove more Li atoms to partially oﬀset the e−transferred from EC to the LMO slab so as to main- tain high voltages. Next we eliminate the Li directly coordinated to the surface O2−anion being dragged by the EC fragment oﬀthe surface (labeled “O” in Fig. 5c) to yield a Li0.5Mn2O4 stoichiometry. Now the equiliva- lent of Fig. 5b, but with one less Li, becomes exothermic (∆E=-0.25 eV, not show in Fig. 5) relative to Fig. 5c, suggesting that this step should proceed.

Instead we focus on the ﬁnal step. For Li0.5Mn2O4, PBE0 predicts that the Fig. 3c →Fig. 3e reaction, associated with CO2 and C2H2O2 release, exhibits ∆E=0.62 eV.

We speculate that the DFT+U parameter for Mn is ﬁtted to Mn(III)/Mn(IV) solid state electrochemistry and may overestimate the stability of the Mn(II) found in Fig. 3. Fig. 5d depicts the product of the CO2 release reac- tion on Li0.5Ni0.5Mn1.5O4, instead of LMO, at the same Li content. While the EC fragment conﬁguration super- ﬁcially resembles that on LMO surfaces, the presence of Ni makes this reaction far less endothermic (∆E=0.08 eV Fig. 4). CO2 release should be accompanied by the typ- ical favorable entropy of ∼0.4-0.5 eV at T=300 K at estimated gas pressure of 0.1 atm.,35 which oﬀsets the 0.08 eV endothermicity. In fact, all steps of further EC oxidation we have examined so far with the PBE0 method (Fig. 3, Fig. 5) are more favorable on LNMO (001) than LMO (001) slabs at the same 50% Li", "page": 5, "position": 1}

(Note that the Fig. 5e transition state does not involve proton trans- fer, and a large zero point correction is not expected.) We have not repeated the similar reaction on LMO sur- face because LMO is expected to be even less oxidative than high-voltage LNMO at the same Li content. It is perhaps not surprising that this complex transition state proves problematic for the DFT+U functional. The un- usual reaction involves the simultaneous transfer of e−, breaking of a C-O covalent bond, and the removal of two oxygen-surface metal coordination. In Fig. 5e, the C-O bond distance is 1.71 ˚A, which is 0.24 ˚A shorter than the 1.95 ˚A predicted using DFT+U. More conventional reac- tions, such as that C-O bond cleavage reaction in CO2− 3 , exhibit ∆E∗which are less sensitive to choice of hybrid or non-hybrid DFT functional.38 For CO2 release to occur, the gas molecule must not re-coordinate to the oxide surface. In the PBE0 NEB barrier calculation, we accidentally come across a con- ﬁguration where the released CO2 adsorbs via another surface O, reconstituting a CO2− 3 motif (Fig. 5f). This conﬁguration is 0.49 eV more favorable than Fig. 5e at zero temperature. Thus, even with the gas entropy gained at T=300 K, CO2 release from the (001) surface of Li0.5Ni0.5Mn1.5O4 is arguably barely favorable. Finally, we examine PBE0 predictions at higher equi- librium voltages. We lower the Li-content to 20% (Li0.2Ni0.5Mn1.5O4) (not shown in ﬁgures), which should raise the equilibrium cathode voltage. With this change in Li-content, the blue diamonds in Fig. 4b indicate that the last two steps of the reaction are now both exothermic, ∆E=-0.72 and -0.82 eV, respectively. The ﬁnal, CO2-releasing step now exhibits a much lower ∆E∗=+0.77 eV instead of the +1.22 eV at x = 0.5. Ac- cording to Eq. 1, CO2 release occurs in sub-second time scales at x = 0.2.

Furthermore, the Fig. 5f-like CO2- adsorption conﬁguration appropriate to 20% Li content exhibits a weak CO2 binding energy of ∆E=-0.36 eV, compared to -0.49 eV at x = 0.5. In other words, as Mn and Ni cations acquire larger charges, O2−anions coor- dinated to them exihbit weaker covalent bonds with CO2 molecules. This ∆E will not retain CO2 on the surface because of the ∼0.4 eV entropy gain upon gas release at T=300 K at 0.1 atm.35 In summary, the more accurate PBE0 method predicts that CO2 release is not energetically favorable on LMO (001) surfaces at 50% Li-content. Even on LNMO (001) at the same Li-content, which should represent a higher equilibrium potential than 4.3 V, CO2 release remains energetically and kinetically hindered. Only at lower Li-content (20%, which corresponds to an even higher equilibrium voltage) does CO2 release become fast.

OEMS Measurements To support the theoretical calculations with experi- mental proofs, we carried out in-operando analysis of gaseous evolution as a function of applied potential us- ing online electrochemical mass spectrometry (OEMS) of LNMO in 1 M LiPF6 in EC:DMC (1:1). The observed evolution of H2, CO2, and C2H4 during galvanostatic charge/discharge is depicted in Fig. 6a. The evolution of C2H4 (m/z=28) at the beginning of ﬁrst charge is likely associated with the SEI formation at the anode side through reductive decomposition of ethy- 7", "page": 6, "position": 2}

By carefully looking at the CO2 evolution, it can be seen that CO2 starts evolving in the OCV period which can be attributed to the spontaneous reaction between the elec- trolyte and the electrode. This evolution attains equi- librium during the rest period. During charge to volt- ages higher than 4.75 V, another evolution of CO2 is observed. A maximum in the CO2 evolution was ob- served at 4.9 V. It is important to note that in OEMS studies, the system is not washed with inert gas during measurements. This fact enables us to continuously mea- sure in-operando the volatile components in the battery cell, without changing its composition and without stop- ping cascades of reactions that take place. However, due to this unique approach, remaining gas species are con- stantly detected (e.g. CO2); hence our discussion always focuses on increase/decrease in evolution and local max- ima/minima. During the discharge, when the lithiation level of the LNMO increases and the potential goes below 4.7 V, the release of CO2 is reduced. The onset of CO2 evolution in the second cycle dur- ing the initiation of the second plateau at 4.75 V further conﬁrms the validity of the calculated results; the evo- lution of CO2 from CEI decomposition occurs mainly at lower Li-content and higher voltage. Note also that our calculations focus on the EC molecule; other elec- trolyte species present in Fig. 6a, such as DMC, may yield more gas products during CEI formation at lower voltages. H2 also exhibited similar pattern of evolution which indicates close involvement of H+ in the degrada- tion of electrolyte and evolution of CO2. This may also in accordance to the predicted transfer of H+ and elec- tron in the EC decomposition, with the caveat that the contribution of anode side to the H2 formation cannot be diﬀerentiated.

At least one recent of modiﬁ- cation of DEMS49 seems able to diﬀerentiate anode and cathode gas contributions. That work also identiﬁes H2, CO, and CO2 products from the cathode. Next we address the question of how LNMO surfaces can become exposed to the liquid electrolyte despite the fact that as-synthesized cathode oxide materials tend to be covered with native Li2CO3 ﬁlms. We perform exper- iments where Li2CO3 particles are soaked in electrolyte with/without LiPF6. These experiments are performed under storage conditions, without applied voltages. We ﬁnd that Li2CO3 dissolves in electrolyte solution as well as in pure DMC solvent (in absence of LiPF6 salt) – al- though the latter is much-suppressed. The dissolution is qualitatively consistent with previous studies.9,90 In the video included in the S.I., the left vial is with 0.1 g Li2CO3 in 20 mL of LP30 electrolyte solution, and the right vial has the same amount of Li2CO3 in 20 mL DMC (a) (b) FIG. 7: (a) First reaction products at Li2CO3 (0001)/LNMO (001) interface, including a Oδ− 2 ; (b) reaction energetics are almost identiﬁcal to panel (a) are predicted when a Au “cur- rent collector” is added to the backside of the oxide slab.

Fig. 6b depicts OEMS response of Li2CO3 soaked in LP30 solution; it conﬁrms that CO2 is evolved as a dissolution product. E. Li2CO3 Reaction on LNMO surfaces (DFT+U) The next two subsections consider oxidation of inor- ganic Li2CO3 ﬁlms.71 They suggest alternative mecha- nisms of Li2CO3 removal prior to LNMO surfaces react- ing with the liquid electrolyte, and complement our work on organic CEI components. In the S.I., we argue that oxidation of Li2CO3 should initiate at interfaces rather than start from the bulk. Here we ﬁrst consider the interface between its Li2CO3 (0001)92,93 and LNMO (001). In brief, we ﬁnd that, to the extent the predicted ∆E and ∆E∗permit oxidation reactions, they are consistent with the release of triplet O2 gas, not CO2 gas (Fig. 7a). This is at variance with experimental results.71 Hence we only highlight one as- pect of the results and leave most details to the S.I. The interface between LNMO (001) and Li2CO3 (Fig. 7a) is Li-deﬁcient, and is likely “metallic.” Fig. S3 in the S.I. conﬁrms the interfacial region has no band gap. Due to this metallic behavior, the electronic volt- age (Ve) can be readily computed as the LNMO work function modiﬁed by its interface with Li2CO3 via the Trasatti relation,91,94,95 provided that the electrolyte contribution is neglected. The computed Ve and the volt- age based on Li-insertion energetics must match to ensure that simulation cells containing interfaces are at “equi- librium,” not at overpotential conditions. We obtain an 8", "page": 7, "position": 2}

In other words, the model system is not at a signiﬁcant overpotential. A more general way to compute Ve, even when the electrode has a band gap, is to place an inert metallic electrode underneath.91 Upon adding a Au (001) “current collector” (Fig. 7b), Ve is found to an almost indistinguishable 4.58 V. Therefore the metallic nature of the thin interface between LNMO and Li2CO3 should be suﬃcent for establishing the electronic poten- tial. The ∆E of the reaction associated with CO2− 3 re- action to form Oδ− 2 is also very similar to the slab model without the Au slab. This dovetails with our experience that redox reactions on cathode surfaces, which involve discrete changes in occupancies of transition metal ion d-orbitals at orbital energies below the Fermi level (S.I.), are not sensitive to Ve,91 unlike reactions on graphitic anodes.96 Therefore we have not made further modiﬁca- tions of the interfaces to bring Ve closer to 4.75 V. There is no metallic character to the LNMO slabs in the previous sections. The cost of PBE0 calculations there makes adding a metallic “current collector” be- neath the LNMO (001) diﬃcult, and this impedes eﬀort to calculate Ve. Along with the small cell sizes, this is one reason we have not reported CO2 release onset voltages. F. Reaction between Li2CO3 and Solvent Molecules Finally, we explore electrolyte oxidative reactions on the outer, partially delithiated Li2CO3 (0001) surface. The PBE functional is applied. As no transition metal ion is present in this section, DFT+U and PBE are equiv- alent. Fig. 8a depicts the (0001) surface with a single ph- ysisorbed EC molecule.

Such a conﬁg- uration change should exhibit no barrier.53 The carbonyl carbon atom is now 4-coordinated. Fig. 8c depicts a sub- sequent conﬁguration with a broken C-O bond, opening the EC 5-member ring and restoring 3-coordination to what was the carbonyl C-atom. The reaction is exother- mic by -0.33 eV compared with the bent conﬁguration (Fig. 8b), but endothermic by +0.35 eV relative to ph- ysisorption (Fig. 8a).

The next step is postulated to involve the transfer of a ethylene proton to a nearby oxygen group, in ac- cordance with EC oxidation on oxide surfaces.53 Unlike LMO or LNMO (001), O atoms on the Li2CO3 (0001) FIG. 8: EC oxidative decomposition on a partially delithated Li2CO3 (0001) surface.

When an H-atom is moved from an EC fragment C atom to a surface CO2− 3 group and the conﬁguration is optimized, we ﬁnd that the proton spontaneous migrates to an oxygen atom on the ROCO2− 2 group on the EC fragment instead (Fig. 8d). Simultaneously, a C-O bond is broken, yielding a CO2 on the Li2CO3 surface.

G. Further Discussions The further oxidation of our model CEI products in- volves the simultaneous transfer of H+ and e−. The role of proton transfer in enabling oxidation of organic com- ponents has been emphasized in the presence of counter ions and at multiple battery interfaces;50,53–62 its impor- tance cannot be overstated. One product of our predicted oxidative decomposition is C2H2O2, known to be a poly- merizing agent. This appears consistent with polymeric CEI species routinely reported on cathode surfaces,12–14 although other mechanisms can lead to polymers. Oxidation of organic molecules and fragments on cath- ode oxide surfaces inject electrons into transition metal ions therein. To oﬀset this electrochemical reduction and to maintain a constant potential, Li atoms should be removed (with Li+ diﬀusing into the electrolyte). Ide- ally, the grand canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) technique should be combined with DFT calculations for this pur- pose; so far DFT-based MC is in its infancy.99 We propose a multi-step electrolyte oxidation path- way (Fig. 1a), which is also suggested for oxidation on Pt surfaces.16 Electrolytes with ﬂuorinated solvent molecules exhibits increased anodic stability.7,8 This be- havior is not inconsistent with our hypothesis, because CEI formed from ﬂuorinated molecules should also be more stable against oxidation than CEI formed from standard organic battery electrolytes. This hypothesis is not inconsistent with Ref. 52, which predicts a one- step release of CO2 from intact EC molecules adsorbed on a pristine LNMO (001) surface.

Such a direct CO2 release route could take place in a voltage regime where all organic CEI products have been oxidized and removed from LNMO surfaces. The reported voltage onset associated with CO2 release varies in the literature. He et al.,42 Michalak et al.,48 and Xu et al.46 have reported CO2 release below 5.0 V (4.8 V, 4.6 V, and 4.8 V respectively), while Jusys et al.49 and Jung et al.44 have reported ∼5.0 V and >5.4 V, respec- tively. Our reported OEMS results are meant to be a check on this issue. We report 4.75 V (Fig. 6), which is in alignment with Refs. 42,46,48. The diﬀerences may arise from charging rates, anode choices,97 electrolytes impurities,98 temperatures, and the initial surface termi- nation of cathode oxide materials. Interestingly, high-Ni content layered NMC materials are reported to release CO2 at much lower voltages than LNMO.44 In another report,42 DMC is found to be more reactive than EC on LNMO. Our calculations have focused on LNMO (001) due to the small cell size that permits PBE0-based cal- culations, and on EC because we have performed previ- ous studies.53,54 In the future, extending our method to DMC, NMC, counter-ions, ond the (111) facet will give interesting comparisons.

CONCLUSIONS We have applied the hybrid PBE0 DFT functional to compute the energetics and kinetics associated with key steps of interfacial oxidation of model cathode elec- trolyte interphase (CEI) components on high voltage spinel (LixNi0.5Mn1.5O4 or LNMO) (001) surfaces. Our model CEI components are partially oxidized ethylene carbonate (EC) molecules from previous computational studies.53 At moderate Li-content (x=0.5), the oxidative reaction barrier ∆E∗is too high. At much lower Li- content (x=0.2) which corresponds to higher equilibrium voltages, ∆E∗decreases, and the oxidative reaction oc- curs within 1-hour battery charging time scales. This leads to removal of adsorbed organic fragments from this surface and release of CO2 molecules. The precise on- set voltage cannot yet be determined. Spinel oxides not doped with Ni, i.e., LixMn2O4 (LMO), exhibits reac- tion energies (∆E) far less favorable towards CO2 release compared with LNMO. We also apply the DFT/PBE0 method to re-examine oxidation kinetics of intact EC molecules on LMO (001) surfaces at 40% charge (x=0.6). ∆E and ∆E∗for the key oxidative step are predicted to be -1.75 eV and 1.05 eV, respectively, to yield adsorbed species which are the CEI components discussed in the last paragraph. This 1.05 eV barrier is much lower than the ∆E∗for a subsequent CEI oxidation reaction at similar Li-content (x=0.5), and is further reduced by zero point corrections. 10", "page": 9, "position": 2}

First EC sol- vent molecules are oxidized at modest voltages and Li- contents. The partially decomposed EC fragment re- mains on the LMO and LNMO (001) surfaces, cover- ing up the reactive transition metal ion sites. At suﬃ- ciently high voltages on LNMO (001), these fragments are oxidized, releasing CO2 gas and clearing the surface for further, uncontrolled reactions with the liquid elec- trolyte. LMO likely behaves similarly at suﬃciently high voltages, but we have not demonstrated this expliclty. Fluoride- and phosphorus-containing CEI products have not been considered in this work. The widely applied DFT+U method, based on the PBE functional, is useful for predicting qualitative ox- idative mechanisms. However, unlike PBE0, it predicts ∆E and ∆E∗which are favorable for oxidation of both EC and adsorbed, partially decomposed EC fragments – even at the modest equilibrium potentials associated with Li0.5Mn2O4. This does not appear to agree our online electrochemical mass spectroscopy (OEMS) mea- surements and those of other groups. This strongly sug- gests that hybrid DFT functionals should be used to spot- check electrolyte oxidation predictions. Nevertheless, we have used the more economic DFT+U method for an exploratory investigation of oxidation of native Li2CO3 ﬁlms on cathode oxides. We conclude that oxidation of Li2CO3 is more likely to ﬁrst occur on the outer Li2CO3 surface in contact with liquid electrolytes, than on its inner surface in contact with cathode oxide materials. All DFT/PBE0 calculations of the model slabs with- out Li2CO3 ﬁlms yield a band gap. Hence there are no delocalized “surface states” – the redox-active states are simply d-orbitals localized on surface Mn and Ni tran- sition metal ions. Higher voltages yield more Ni(IV), Ni(III), and Mn(IV) cations and accelerate organic CEI degradation reactions. Two general conclusions that can be drawn from our speciﬁc PBE0 functional calculations are: PBE0 is probably more accurate than DFT+U when applied to Mn(II)/Mn(III) redox couple. PBE0 predicts higher reaction barriers associated with C-H and C-O bond-breaking, especially in reactions that releases CO2.

This comparative study on EC, organic CEI compo- nent, and Li2CO3 oxidation highlights the importance of multi-step reactions, and emphasizes the need to ex- amine the oxidation of CEI/surface ﬁlms, not just intact solvent molecules. Diﬀerentiating CEI and solvent oxida- tion events under high voltage conditions should lead to new insights that inform cathode passivation strategies.
