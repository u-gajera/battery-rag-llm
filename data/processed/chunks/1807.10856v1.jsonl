Thomson Avenue, Cambridge CB3 0HE, United Kingdom 3Current Address: Max Planck Institute for Chemical Energy Conversion, Stiftstr. 3436, M¨ulheim an der Ruhr 45470, Germany October 3, 2018 Abstract We present a comprehensive ab initio investigation on Mg3Bi2, a promising Mg-ion bat- tery anode material with high rate capacity. Through combined DFT (PBE, HSE06) and G0W0 electronic structure calculations, we ﬁnd that Mg3Bi2 is likely to be a small band gap semiconductor. DFT-based defect formation energies indicate that Mg vacancies are likely to form in this material, with relativistic spin-orbit coupling signiﬁcantly lowering the defect formation ener- gies. We show that a transition state searching methodology based on the hybrid eigenvector- following approach can be used eﬀectively to search for the transition states in cases where full spin-orbit coupling is included. Mg migration barriers found through this hybrid eigenvector- following approach indicate that spin-orbit coupling also lowers the migration barrier, decreas- ing it to a value of 0.34 eV with spin-orbit coupling. Finally, recent experimental results on Mg diﬀusion are compared to the DFT results and show good agreement. This work demonstrates that vacancy defects and the inclusion of relativistic spin-orbit coupling in the calculations have a profound eﬀect in Mg diﬀusion in this material. It also sheds light on the importance of relativistic spin-orbit coupling in studying similar battery systems where heavy elements play a crucial role. 1 Introduction Extensive research has been performed on lithium-ion battery (LIB) systems in the last few decades, resulting in their integration into electric vehicles and handheld devices.1 However, supply restric- tions, high cost, and safety limitations of LIBs have kindled research into battery systems using alternative metal ions. Recently, batteries based on multivalent ion chemistries such as Mg2+, Al3+, and Ca2+ have gained attention due to their low cost and high volumetric densities, features 1 arXiv:1807.10856v1 [cond-mat.mtrl-sci] 27", "page": 0, "position": 0}

However, currently at least three factors hinder the application of working MIB systems: (1) absence of electrolytes compatible with high-voltage cathodes, (2) slow diﬀusion of divalent Mg2+ ions in electrode materials, and (3) passivation of Mg metal surfaces due to electrolyte decomposition reactions and the concomitant diﬃculties in stripping and plating Mg.3 While possible high-voltage MIB cathode candidates have been identiﬁed,2 it remains extremely challenging to identify an electrolyte that is suitable for use with both high voltage cathodes and Mg metal. This incompatibility of electrolytes that are suitable for high voltage cathodes with Mg metal and vice versa has been a problem in developing a working MIB system. Hence, a number of studies have focused on using an alternative anode material other than Mg to bypass this problem.3 In this respect, bismuth metal is a promising anode material with a low discharge voltage of 0.2 V versus Mg metal.4–6 Bismuth alloys with magnesium to form an intermetallic Mg3Bi2 phase, resulting in a theoretical capacity of 385 mAh/g. However, the most interesting feature of bismuth anode is that it displays fast Mg ion insertion and de-insertion, a feature not present in most other Mg-ion electrodes.4,7 Recently, our group has used 25Mg Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to study Mg3Bi2 and reported fast exchange between the two crystallographically distinct Mg sites in this material; a dependence of the exchange rate and activation energy on the preparation condition (ball-milling and electrochemical synthesis) was also demonstrated.8 As ion dynamics are properties intimately related to the defect chemistry (which in turn depends heavily on the preparation conditions) and ultimately the electronic structure, we present an in- depth ab initio investigation on the Mg3Bi2 system, the end product of discharge process.

The results are presented in four sections: in the ﬁrst section, we discuss the structural characteristics of Mg3Bi2, identifying the possible Mg diﬀusion pathways. Next, electronic structures and defect energetics are described. Due to the well known problem of band gap underestimation in semilocal DFT, we use three diﬀerent methods (PBE, HSE06, and G0W0) to calculate the electronic structure. In particular, the Greens function based G0W0 method is used to give the most accurate value for the minimum band gap, overcoming the band gap problem in semilocal DFT. Bismuth is a heavy element where relativistic spin-orbit coupling is expected to have a signiﬁcant inﬂuence on the properties relevant to battery chemistry, as shown for lead in a recent ab initio study of the lead-acid battery.9 Thus, calculations were performed with and without the explicit spin-orbit coupling Hamiltonian. Inclusion of spin-orbit coupling was found to reduce the band gap, defect formation energies, and also the Mg migration barrier which was calculated using the hybrid eigenvector-following approach. Using these results we are able to reconcile and rationalize previous reports on the Mg mobility in Mg3Bi2, in which very diﬀerent Mg mobilities were assumed to occur due to the diﬀerent concentrations of Mg vacancies in the samples. We also demonstrate that the hybrid eigenvector-following method can be a very eﬃcient approach for locating transition states in systems where spin-orbit coupling is likely to play an important role. 2 Methodology 2.1 Computational Details All Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations were performed with the VASP code10,11 em- ploying the projector-augmented wave (PAW) method.12 Spin-polarized Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof 2", "page": 1, "position": 1}

All lattice relaxations were performed with 1.3 times the ENMAX value as deﬁned in the pseudopotential ﬁle. In addition, additional support grid was used for the evaluation of augmented charges (ADDGRID=.TRUE.). Self-consistent ﬁeld (SCF) cycles were converged with an energy tolerance of 10−4 eV. Monkhorst- Pack k-point sampling of < 0.05 ˚A-1 was used in the Brillouin zone. For the density of states and band structure calculations, Mg 2p states were also treated as valence states in the PAW potential and an increased cutoﬀof 550 eV was used. Cellular relaxations SCF cycles were converged to a 10−6 eV limit. Γ-centered k-point sampling of < 0.03 ˚A-1 was used. Single-shot G0W0 calculations were performed with 250 frequency grid points and a 360 eV plane-wave cutoﬀfor the response function calculations. HSE06 wavefunctions were used as starting wavefunctions for the G0W0 calculations. Band gap convergence with respect to the number of frequency grid points, number of empty bands, and plane-wave cutoﬀs were checked. Quasiparticle energy iterations were converged to a 10−8 eV limit. Relativistic corrections to the electronic structure were taken into account through two levels of theory: a ‘scalar relativistic’ correction which only includes the mass-velocity and Darwin terms of the relativistic Hamiltonian, as implemented in VASP;15 and a ‘full relativistic’ correction that explicitly includes the spin-orbit coupling term alongside the scalar relativistic correction. The initial structure of Mg3Bi2 was fully relaxed until the energy diﬀerences between the sub- sequent steps are converged to 10−5 eV per cell and the forces are < 0.05 eV/˚A-1.

Only the neutral defects are considered since the system has a vanishing band gap under the PBE level of theory, with the metallic be- haviour enhanced under the inclusion of spin-orbit coupling. Whereas the formation energies under the HSE06 level of theory (where a ﬁnite band gap was observed) could give a chemical potential dependence, this was not possible due to the computational resources available. 2.2 Transition State Searching Transition state and steepest-descent pathway were found using the hybrid eigenvector-following ap- proach as implemented in the OPTIM code.17 Details on the algorithm are available elsewhere.18,19 In brief, this method ﬁnds the smallest eigenvalue of the Hessian matrix without calculating the full matrix, by minimizing the Rayleigh-Ritz ratio. Here we use a low-memory Broyden-Fletcher- Goldfarb-Shannon (LBFGS) scheme to minimize this ratio on a given point to ﬁnd the uphill path. The minimization was deemed to have occurred when the root-mean-square gradient is smaller than 0.025 eV ˚A-1. Then up to ﬁve LBFGS minimization steps are performed in the tangent space until the root-mean-square gradient is smaller than 10−3 eV ˚A-1. Initial guesses of the transition state structure were produced by removing a nearby Mg atom and putting the migrating Mg atom in the middle of the proposed diﬀusion path. The steepest descent pathway from the transition state is found by displacing the atoms by 0.1 ˚A from the transition state in the parallel and antiparallel directions to the eigenvector. Local minima are then found by the LBFGS algorithm with energy convergence of 10−3 eV. 3", "page": 2, "position": 1}

In addition, unlike the classical nudged elastic band (NEB) method where only a few points along the pathway are sampled, HEF method can sample the path at an arbitrary step size. This allows us to capture the ﬁner details of the energy variance along the pathway. 3 Results and Discussion 3.1 Crystal structure Mg3Bi2 is the last in a series of magnesium pnictide compounds Mg3X2 (X=P, As, Sb, Bi) and is a Zintl-type compound with closed shell ions with formal charges of Mg2+ and Bi3–. It adopts an anti- La2O3 type structure with hexagonal P¯3m1 space-group symmetry.20 The structure is schematically illustrated in Figure 1. In terms of ion arrangements, Mg3Bi2 incorporates two alternating layers: layer A consists of tetrahedrally coordinated Mg2+ cations and octahedral interstitial sites forming ‘covalent’ Mg2Bi 2– 2 sheets whereas layer B consists of octahedrally coordinated Mg2+ cations and tetrahedral interstitial sites. These interstitial sites are expected to play an important role in ionic diﬀusion21 as discussed further below. b c a Tet Mg Oct Int Tet Mg (b) (a) Layer A Layer B Layer A Tet Int Oct Mg Tet Int Oct Mg 2 1 3 Tet Mg Oct Int Tet Mg Oct Int Tet Int Oct Int Tet Int Figure 1: (a) Crystal structure of Mg3Bi2.

In a series of work, Ferrier and co-workers have speculated that Mg3Bi2 is semimetallic based on a conductivity-composition plot;25,26 Lazarev et al. have assumed Mg3Bi2 is semiconducting with Eg = 0.1 eV;22 Watson et al. obtained Eg = 0.5 eV from Mg X-ray emission spectra.27 Work on the amorphous Mg3Bi2 alloy have shown from conductivity measurements that it is semiconducting with a band gap of 0.15 eV.28 These varying results may arise from the diﬃculty in preparing these materials stoichiometrically, due to the high vapor pressure of Mg.

Hence, we revisit the electronic structure of this compound using state-of-the-art electronic structure methods such as hybrid functionals and many-body perturbation theory in the G0W0 approximation, and also consider the eﬀects of spin-orbit coupling. First we look at the Bader charges of Mg and Bi in the structure, shown in Table 2. The HSE06 functional results in an increased ionicity in the system compared to the semilocal PBE values. In all cases, inclusion of SOC resulted in decreased ionicity which is consistent with the density of states data shown below. 5", "page": 4, "position": 1}

Only the valence charge is calculated. Figure 2 shows the density of states (DOS) plots obtained for Mg3Bi2 using DFT within the semilocal PBE and hybrid HSE06 approximations. Both methods show the same trend comparing the results with and without SOC. As expected from the charge distribution of Mg3Bi2, the top of valence band is strongly dominated by the bismuth 6p contribution down to around −5 eV from the Fermi level and has a negligible Mg contribution. As expected from the literature, the relativistic contraction of the bismuth 6s states around −12 eV from the Fermi level results in a relatively large separation of around 5 eV between the top of 6s and the bottom of 6p states, which makes it chemically inactive (the so-called inert-pair eﬀect).35 The downshift in 6s energy by adding the full relativistic eﬀect is around -0.15 eV; eﬀects of similar magnitudes were observed in PbO2, an important active material in lead-acid batteries.9 Figure 3 shows the band structure of Mg3Bi2 using DFT within the semilocal PBE and hybrid HSE06 approximations, with and without the spin-orbit interaction. At the PBE level, Mg3Bi2 exhibits semimetallic behavior, consistent with earlier reports of a type-II nodal line semimetal at this level of theory.32 The inclusion of spin-orbit coupling opens a small gap in the nodal line, but the system remains semimetallic. At the HSE06 level, Mg3Bi2 is a semiconductor with the minimum band gap of 0.36 eV located at the Γ point. The inclusion of spin-orbit coupling reduces the band gap to 0.17 eV, but the system remains semiconducting. The G0W0 calculations show that the Γ-point band gap increases to 0.58 eV without spin-orbit coupling.

We note that inclusion of SOC results in a reduced band gap and increased dispersion of the Bi 6p states. Previous reports on binary Sb and Te compounds have attributed this phenomenon to spin-orbit coupling in the anion p-orbitals: energy splitting of the degenerate p-states result in the j = 3/2 state being split upward in energy, and the j = 1/2 state being split downward in energy.36 The net eﬀect of this splitting is a reduction in the band gap. 3.3 Defect energetics To investigate the possibility of diﬀerent types of defects present in the Mg3Bi2 sample, formation energies ∆Ef of various stoichiometric and non-stoichiometric point defects were calculated ab initio. The results outlined in Table 3 are separated into three categories: antisite defects, Frenkel defects, and vacancy defects, which we discuss in sequence. Nonstoichiometric antisite and vacancy defects were created by removing or inserting relevant atoms from the stoichiometric cell while retaining the charge neutrality of the cell due to Mg3Bi2 being a semimetal at the PBE level of theory (i.e. charged defects are not possible under such a situation). For instance, a Mg vacancy 6", "page": 5, "position": 1}

Charge neutrality is automatically maintained in the antisite and Frenkel defects since they are stoichiometric. First, the formation of antisite defects are energetically unfavorable, with the Mg on a Bi site having the highest formation energy of 2.92 eV. This is most likely due to the large diﬀerence between their ionic radii. Despite the fact that no ionic radius for the Bi3– ion is reported, the trend can still be explained in terms of the corresponding atomic radii of Mg and Bi (Mg 1.50 ˚A; Bi 1.60 ˚A), the diﬀerence being expected to get even larger as Mg is oxidized and Bi is reduced. This is also supported from the Mg–Bi bond lengths in Mg3Bi2 crystal: Mgoct–Bi 3.21 ˚A versus Mgtet–Bi 2.92 ˚A. Using the Shannon radii of 0.72 and 0.57 ˚A for Mgoct and Mgtet, respectively,37 Bi3– radii of 2.49 and 2.35 ˚A are obtained in each case. In addition, the unfavourable electrostatic interaction between the ions of same charge (Mg occupying the Bi lattice site is coordinated by Mg ions, and vice versa) reinforces the high energy cost in forming these types of defects. The ∆Ef of Frenkel-type defects (creation of a vacancy plus an interstitial) are also shown to be relatively high for both nearby and separated vacancy–interstitial pairs; around 0.8-1.2 eV is required for their formation. However, performing structural relaxation on some of the starting guesses with the defect Mg ion sitting on an interstitial site that is adjacent (in the ﬁrst coordination shell) to a Mg vacancy (speciﬁcally, the VMg(oct) + Mgi(tet) (nn), VMg(tet) + Mgi(tet) (nn), and VMg(tet) + Mgi(tet) (nn) cases) resulted in the structure reverting back to that of the pristine cell, with no defects. This indicates that these defects are energetically unstable", "page": 7, "position": 0}

This indicates that these defects are energetically unstable and they would revert back to the original structure, if formed at all. These sites, as we will see later, may play an important role as energy maximum transition state sites in Mg-ion diﬀusion. Perhaps the most surprising results are the energies of the vacancy defects: while Mg vacancy defects have around the same ∆Ef as Frenkel defects without SOC, their magnitudes are reduced signiﬁcantly when SOC is included in the Hamiltonian. From the fully relativistic calculation on the 120-atom supercell with SOC included, ∆Ef of octahedral vacancies VMg(oct) is found to be as low as 0.33 eV, with a slightly higher value of 0.42 eV for tetrahedral vacancies VMg(tet). This eﬀect is likely to be connected to the enhanced shielding of Bi 6p-levels due to the SOC eﬀect as explained above: as formation of a neutral Mg vacancy should involve loss of electrons from the Bi, this deshielding should result in a signiﬁcant reduction of the formation energy. Hence, considering their low formation energies, we conclude that vacancy defects are the dominant type of defects present in Mg3Bi2. 3.4 Mg migration kinetics Having established the defect chemistry in Mg3Bi2, we now turn our attention to the Mg diﬀusion in this structure and study the migration barriers. As Mg vacancies were shown to have low formation energy, especially with SOC included, we attempt to simulate the eﬀect of vacancy diﬀusion following the creation of one octahedral Mg vacancy VMg(oct). This has lower ∆Ef than the tetrahedral vacancy VMg(tet) as illustrated in the previous section. Then, a nearby tetrahedral Mg atom is removed from its original position and placed on the guessed ‘transition state’.

This is in line with the conclusion from 25Mg NMR studies of Liu et al.8 An alternative exchange mechanism involving Path 3 on Figure 1b was also investigated, but the transition structure searching resulted in the same transition state as for the Path 1, clearly indicating the absence of a diﬀusion pathway along this line.

As reported in the literature, bismuth can be cycled reversibly to form Mg3Bi2 in a Mg-ion battery.4 Previous work on magnesium ion conduction in bismuth anodes either used the Galvanostatic Intermittent Titration Technique (GITT) on an electrochemical cell, or ex-situ variable-temperature (VT) 25Mg NMR spectroscopy to probe Mg transport.7,8 In this work, however, we restrict the discussion to the latter NMR result, due to the following limitation of GITT experiments: in the GITT measurement, the voltage response (resulting from the relaxation) of the cell after the application of a short current pulse is modelled with the diﬀusion equation to extract the diﬀusion coeﬃcient D under the assumption that the (de)insertion reaction occurs via solid solution (i.e. the relaxation of the potential after the current pulse is a measure of ionic transport through a single phase). In-situ X-ray diﬀraction results, however, have clearly shown that magnesiation occurs via a two-phase reaction between Bi and Mg3Bi2.8 Thus the diﬀusion coeﬃcients extracted from GITT measurements must be treated with caution, since the relaxation phenomena under these conditions may include multiple contributions such as (i) redistribution of Mg ions due to the formation of metastable (possibly non-stoichiometric solid solution) phases formed under operating conditions (and on", "page": 9, "position": 0}

In-situ X-ray diﬀraction results, however, have clearly shown that magnesiation occurs via a two-phase reaction between Bi and Mg3Bi2.8 Thus the diﬀusion coeﬃcients extracted from GITT measurements must be treated with caution, since the relaxation phenomena under these conditions may include multiple contributions such as (i) redistribution of Mg ions due to the formation of metastable (possibly non-stoichiometric solid solution) phases formed under operating conditions (and on application of an overpotential), and (ii) redistribution of phase boundaries to minimise the interfacial energies, etc. We now consider transport in two cases, the ﬁrst in a completely stoichiometric material where we need to consider the energy associated with defect formation. In this case, substitutional and vacancy defects are not relevant because they result in stoichiometry changes. The second case explores diﬀusion in oﬀ-stoichiometry materials Mg3-xBi2 and Mg3Bi2+y, representing Mg vacancy and (excess) Bi substitutional defects, respectively. As no extrinsic Mg vacancies are expected in the stoichiometric Mg3Bi2 compound, the diﬀusion in this case must occur via a vacancy diﬀusion mechanism involving thermally generated Mg vacancies; hence the observed D would be the dif- fusion coeﬃcient of Mg vacancies. In the latter case, nonstoichiometry dictates that extrinsic Mg vacancies must exist in the compound. Table 4 compares the eﬀective activation barriers Eeﬀ a obtained experimentally versus the Eeﬀ a estimated from the ab initio calculations using the scalar relativistic (SR) and full relativistic (FR) treatments. Looking at the SR case ﬁrst, a large variation in Eeﬀ a is observed where a signiﬁcantly lower barrier is predicted for the Mg jumps with an existing nearby extrinsic vacancy defect (i.e. Case 2, Mg3-xBi2 SR): 0.43 eV. In Case 1 (stoichiometric Mg3Bi2), where generation of a thermal Mg vacancy is required for diﬀusion, the eﬀective diﬀusion barrier Eeﬀ a should now include this formation of vacancy. Naturally, we would expect an increase in Eeﬀ a due to this inclusion of vacancy formation energy: depending on the vacant site (tetrahedral or octahedral Mg vacancy), the Eeﬀ a is estimated to be 1.46 eV (octahedral) or 1.55 eV (tetrahedral). We also observe that inclusion of", "page": 9, "position": 1}

VT NMR data are taken from Liu et al.8 For the NMR measurements, Mg3Bi2 prepared through elec- trochemical insertion and mechanical milling were considered. SR and FR refer to scalar relativistic and full relativistic calculations, as described in the text. FR case results in a dramatically lowered formation energy. Comparing these results to the experiment, the eﬀective activation barrier Eeﬀ a in the fully rel- ativistic case ignoring the vacancy creation (Case 2) agrees with the Eeﬀ a of the ball-milled sample, determined through VT NMR. On the other hand, Eeﬀ a obtained for the electrochemically prepared samples (VT NMR Echem) agree well with the Eeﬀ a assuming a Mg vacancy creation plus Mg diﬀusion (Case 1). Hence, we conclude that the primary diﬀusion mechanism in electrochemically prepared samples (measured ex-situ, i.e. not during battery operating conditions) should involve vacancy creation, whereas the mechanism in mechanically prepared samples only involves the va- cancy diﬀusion. This could be explained by method of sample preparation: the electrochemical Mg insertion process in this case produced samples closer to the thermodynamic equilibrium creating fewer vacancies, whereas mechanical milling is largely a high energy process resulting in more vacan- cies (for instance, vacancy formation in ZnO through milling was previously observed with HRTEM studies38). This is also a known phenomenon in the synthesis of intermetallic phases: mechanical milling can provide excess energy to the material, which can be stored in the sample as atomistic disorders of which vacancies are one example.39 Furthermore, as discussed above, Mg deﬁciency is likely due to preferential Mg sticking to the ball-mill components (jar, balls). The already present vacancies in mechanically prepared samples act as potential diﬀusion sites for adjacent Mg ions, enhancing their diﬀusion.

The already present vacancies in mechanically prepared samples act as potential diﬀusion sites for adjacent Mg ions, enhancing their diﬀusion. Extending this result to a battery under operating conditions, it is important to stress that the Mg3-xBi2 phases formed in-situ may not be stoichiometric. The kinetics of Bi (de)magnesiation will depend on a number of factors which include the interfacial energies between the Bi and Mg3Bi2 phases, and transport of Mg in Bi, Mg3Bi2, and at the various interfaces. In particular, the mechanism of demagnesiation will depend strongly on the ease of vacancy formation in Mg3Bi2. By analogy with our work on lithium silicides40 and of others (e.g. CuTi2S4 41), this energy of vacancy formation may even be responsible for setting (or strongly inﬂuencing) the overpotential observed on charge. Finally, we note that Zintl-type A3B2 materials to which Mg3Bi2 belongs have been identiﬁed as potentially promising thermoelectric materials.42,43 Mg mobility in these materials could have important implications on the thermoelectric power generation, and work is in progress on doping other atoms into this structure to enhance, or suppress, this mobility. 12", "page": 11, "position": 1}

Inclusion of relativistic spin-orbit coupling also signiﬁcantly lowers the formation energies of Mg vacancy defects, which is crucial to the apparent low Mg-ion diﬀusion barrier. Using an eﬃcient single-ended hybrid eigenvector-following approach, we have calculated the Mg migration barriers involving relativistic spin-orbit coupling which are as low as 0.34 eV for the octahedral to tetrahedral diﬀusion. The calculated activation barriers are in good agreement with the previous experimental report using variable temperature 25Mg NMR experiments for materials prepared electrochemically and via ball-milling. Stoichiometric materials show higher activation energies, since the activation energy involves both the cost of vacancy generation and transport. An understanding of Mg trans- port and the energetics of vacancy formation are important in understanding the mechanisms for demagnesiation of Mg3Bi2. This work sheds light on ways of improving the Mg diﬀusion in similar materials such as Sn, which have been shown to have good capacity but poor rate performance in Mg-ion batteries.44 5 Acknowledgement We thank Professor David Wales for helpful discussions.
