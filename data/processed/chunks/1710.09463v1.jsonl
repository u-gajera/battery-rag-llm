We show, that after depo- sition of two molecular layers of alkali metal oxides, the initial state of the TiC surface becomes unimportant for the adsorption energy and that all adsorption energies approach their native crystal values. The structure of the adsorbed molecular layers is analyzed and compared to their native oxide crystal structure. Finally, we discuss the possible implications for electrode optimization for Li-air and Na-air batteries. I. INTRODUCTION Rechargeable metal-air batteries are widely considered to be the next generation high-energy-density electro- chemical storage devices. The intense interest in Li-air and Na-air batteries stems from their high theoretical speciﬁc energy, which exceeds that of lithium-ion batter- ies [1–11]. The high speciﬁc energy densities of metal- air batteries result from the use of alkali metals as an- odes and ambient-air oxygen, as cathode materials. The discharge process in Li-air batteries involves an electro- chemical reaction between Li+ ions and O2 to form Li2O2 onto the cathode surface. During charging, oxidation of lithium peroxide, followed by generation of oxygen gas occurs. The optimization of charge and discharge processes in- volves careful design of the cathode material, the elec- trolytes, solvents, and mediators. The selection of sol- vents may aﬀect whether the discharge products are formed at the cathode surface, or in the solution, and the prevalence of un-wanted side reactions [11, 12]. The performance and rechargeability of metal-air cells strongly depends on the positive electrode material, where oxygen reduction and evolution reactions take place. A suitable cathode material for an aprotic alkali metal/air cell should have suﬃcient electronic conductiv- ity, low density, high stability over the operating", "page": 0, "position": 0}

The performance and rechargeability of metal-air cells strongly depends on the positive electrode material, where oxygen reduction and evolution reactions take place. A suitable cathode material for an aprotic alkali metal/air cell should have suﬃcient electronic conductiv- ity, low density, high stability over the operating voltage of the cathode towards nucleophilic attack by LiO2 and O22−, low cost, and non-toxicity [11]. Carbon has been the material of choice for the porous cathode. It is known that carbon oxidizes above 4V versus Li. However, more importantly, carbon raises problems that impede its use in Li/O2 cells. Carbon decomposes during oxidation of Li2O2 on charging above 3V as a result of the attack by intermediates of Li2O2 oxidation and it actively pro- motes electrolyte decomposition on discharge and charge, rendering it unsuitable for aprotic Li/O2 cells [13, 14]. Titanium carbide can overcome some of the disadvan- tages of carbon [14]. Recently, nanocrystalline TiC has been shown to be an eﬃcient gas diﬀusion cathode [14]. TiC has good metallic conductivity. Furthermore, the formation of a passivating monolayer of TiO2 on the TiC surface was reported to be vital to the system’s cycleabil- ity. The atomic oxide layer greatly reduces side reactions associated with electrode and electrolyte degradation at the electrolyte/cathode interface as compared with car- bon [14–16]. While the Li-air battery has the highest theoretical energy density [8–11, 17], the low availability of lithium might lead to future depletion. In contrast to lithium, there are abundant sodium sources in both the earth’s crust (2.3%) and in the oceans (1.1%) [18]. Moreover, the production of sodium is cheaper than that of lithium. Na-air battery systems have a lower theoretical speciﬁc energy density compared to Li-air battery systems (1605 or 1108 Wh kg-1 considering Na2O2 or NaO2 as dis- charge products, respectively). However, Na-air batteries also demonstrate lower charge/discharge overpotential, which may result in better durability [3]. Therefore, Na- O2 battery oﬀers an interesting alternative to the Li-O2 battery. Even", "page": 0, "position": 1}

However, Na-air batteries also demonstrate lower charge/discharge overpotential, which may result in better durability [3]. Therefore, Na- O2 battery oﬀers an interesting alternative to the Li-O2 battery. Even though sodium and lithium share many physicochemical properties, the chemistry of the Li-air and Na-air cells is not the same. While sodium forms stable sodium superoxide, lithium superoxide is ther- modynamically unstable [18]. It is expected that both sodium peroxide and superoxide would be formed un- der diﬀerent physicochemical conditions, however kinetic factors, temperature and oxygen pressure, the type of support and catalysts may stabilize a certain phase over the other[19, 20]. A key process of lithium-air and sodium-air systems is the possible adsorption of reaction products and inter- mediates at the cathode surface. The surface adsorption energy and product growth (e.g., Na2O2) at the surface, can be compared to the energetics of product formation in solution, where both kinetics and Li+ and Na+ ener- getics can aﬀect the ﬁnal result. Recently, the adsorption of Li2O2 clusters on the TiC(111) surface was theoreti- cally investigated by Wang et al.[21, 22] using density functional theory. In this work we performed ab-initio DFT simulations of nLi2O2, nNa2O2 and nNaO2 (n = 1−6) molecular ad- arXiv:1710.09463v1 [physics.chem-ph] 25 Oct 2017", "page": 0, "position": 2}

We investigated structural and adsorption energy trends as a function of molecular density on both pristine and oxygen passivated TiC(111) surfaces. The highest mag- nitude of the adsorption energy was found for molecules on the pristine surface at n = 1, 2 that bind directly with the reactive Ti-terminated surface, forming O−Li/Na bi- layers. At larger molecular density of alkali metal oxides (AMO) there is a reduction in adsorption energy and ﬁ- nally after two molecular layers of AMO the adsorption energy gain reaches an almost constant value close to the AMO native crystal growth energy because of no direct contact with the TiC surface. We also discuss the work function and d-band shift as a function of AMO surface density. Finally, we discuss the possible implications of our results for the optimization of TiC and other elec- trode materials for Li-air and Na-air batteries. II. THEORETICAL APPROACH AND COMPUTATIONAL DETAILS For the total energy calculations we have used Den- sity Functional Theory (DFT) with the generalized gra- dient approximation (GGA) [23] functional as proposed by Perdew, Burke, and Ernzerhof (PBE) [24]. Since tita- nium is a transition metal, one might consider utilization of the Hubbard correction (PBE+U). In addition, Van der Waals (VdW) corrections might aﬀect the adsorp- tion properties of the systems considered. We analyze both eﬀects in the supporting information (SI) and show that they do not signiﬁcantly change our conclusions. We therefore use the PBE functional throughout all the cal- culations that are shown here. To solve Kohn-Sham DFT equations we used projected augmented wave (PAW) pseudopotentials [25, 26] as im- plemented in the Vienna Ab-initio Simulations Package (VASP) [27, 28]. We used a Monkhorst-Pack k-point sampling scheme [29] with k-point meshes of 11×11×11, 11 × 11 × 1 and gamma point for the bulk, surface and gas-phase molecules, respectively, and a cutoﬀenergy of 500 eV for all the calculations, except for the bulk calculations, in which a higher cutoﬀwas used for the stress tensor minimization procedure. The structures were considered as optimized to their ground state", "page": 1, "position": 0}

The structures were considered as optimized to their ground state ge- ometries when the atomic forces per atom were smaller than 0.02 eV per ˚A and a total energy convergence of 10−6 eV was achieved. To model the TiC, Li2O2 and Na2O2 bulks and sur- faces we used the AFLOW [30] package and the ICSD database [31]. The TiC(111) surface was constructed by applying the repeated slab model with 8 layers, 2 × 2 surface unit cell and 21 ˚A vacuum region, which was found to be suﬃcient. Thicker slabs of TiC were shown to give similar results and are discussed in the SI. We found that the Ti-terminated TiC(111) surface is more stable than the C-terminated TiC(111) surface, which is sup- ported by previous results [21, 32, 33]. Thus, for our fur- ther simulations of the molecules on TiC(111) we use the Ti-terminated TiC(111) surface. The oxidized TiC(111) surface was modelled by covering the Ti-terminated TiC(111) surface by oxygen atoms at the positions of the next imaginary layer of carbon atoms layer. Our cal- culated surface energy for the Ti-terminated TiC(111) surface, 201.8 meV/˚A2, is slightly lower than the result reported by Wang et. al. (208 meV/˚A2) [21]. A. Atomic structure generation of nM2O2 (M = Li, Na) and nMO2 (M = Na) (n = 1–6) on TiC(111) surface The adsorption geometry of the AMOs is ﬁrst dictated by the reactive TiC surface. As more AMO layers are formed, the geometry becomes less aﬀected by the TiC surface and should eventually approach that of the native AMO crystal. Hence, the resulting geometry of the ﬁrst layers is somewhere in between the positions dictated by the TiC surface and the AMO native crystal.

Hence, the resulting geometry of the ﬁrst layers is somewhere in between the positions dictated by the TiC surface and the AMO native crystal. This grad- ual change makes the ﬁnding of a global minimum for the geometry a greater challenge. We simulated, as an initial guess, diﬀerent nLi2O2, nNa2O2, and nNaO2 (n = 1–6) structures on the pristine and oxidized TiC(111) surfaces by applying the following procedures which are described below in the text: (i) ﬁrst-principles molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, (ii) ﬁnding a common crystalline cell and (iii) cross-check procedure. In all of the calculations we placed the molecules on one side of the slab and em- ployed dipole correction in order to obtain accurate total energies. We allowed the molecules to relax along with four slab layers, while the remaining bottom layers were frozen. The details of the simulations are as follows: (i) MD simulations: we performed MD simulations by applying the Nos´e thermostat and slowly lowering the temperature from 300 K (and 500 K) to 0 K for 30 ps. The initial structural models were built by putting the optimized gas-phase Li2O2, Na2O2 and NaO2 molecules at random positions at about 3 −4 ˚A above the pristine and oxidized TiC(111) surfaces. (ii) Common crystalline cell: In order to investi- gate the crystal Li2O2, Na2O2, and NaO2 structures on the TiC(111) surfaces we employed the geometrical lat- tice match algorithm proposed by Zur and McGil [34]. This algorithm can be successfully used to ﬁt superlat- tices with any pair of crystals and surfaces. Thus, we created a common cell for the hexagonal Li2O2(001) and Na2O2(001) surfaces on the hexagonal TiC(111) surface, and cubic NaO2(001) surface on the hexagonal TiC(111) surface. It can be shown that 2Li2O2(001) and 2NaO2(001) form a full layer at the (2×2) TiC(111) surface hexagonal unit cell, and so we built the crystal structures with n", "page": 1, "position": 2}

This happens because although the (2 × 2) TiC(111) surface unit cell is commensurate with the Na2O2 crystal, it cannot accommodate an integer number of molecules for a single and full molecular layer of its native crystal. In order to achieve complete crystal layer coverage by an integer number of molecules, we re- peated our calculations with a larger rectangular surface cell that has twice the surface area. The results of these calculations can be found in SI and generally agree with the analysis of the smaller cell. (iii) Cross-check procedure: Finally, we performed cross-check between the lowest energy structures of nLi2O2 and nNa2O2 with the aim of investigating ad- ditional possible conﬁgurations. We took the lowest en- ergy nLi2O2 structure and used it as a starting point for geometrical relaxation of the respective nNa2O2 system, and vice-versa. This was helpful in some particular cases to ﬁnd lower energy structures that were missed by the MD procedure. Thus, we constructed about 4-5 initial conﬁgurations for every system, which were ﬁnally optimized with the standard optimization procedure applying the con- jugated gradient algorithm as implemented in VASP. Fi- nally, we collected all these structures and selected the lowest energy conﬁgurations, which were used for further analyses. III. RESULTS A. TiC, Li2O2, Na2O2 and NaO2 bulks, common cells and gas-phase molecules Titanium carbide (TiC) bulk has a face centered cubic (fcc) structure with the O5 h space group symmetry. Our calculated TiC equilibrium lattice constant, a = 4.337 ˚A, is close to the thermal expansion experimental value (4.318 ˚A) [35] and recent PBE calculations (4.333 ˚A) [22]. Li2O2 and Na2O2 bulks crystallize in hexagonal P63/mmc and P62m space groups, respectively. The lattice parameters we obtained are 3.158 ˚A and 7.686 ˚A for Li2O2 and 6.195 ˚A and 4.472 ˚A for Na2O2, in good agreement with the experimental values [36] and previous theoretical GGA results [22, 37, 38].

NaO2 can crystal- lize in a pyrite structure in Pa3 space group (between 196 and 223 K), and in Fm3m space group (above 223 K), which corresponds to a pyrite structure with a disor- der of O2 orientation, as obtained by powder and single crystal X-ray diﬀraction methods [39]. Our calculated structure corresponds to the ordered pyrite structure in Pa3 space group with a calculated lattice parameter of 5.521 ˚A, which is in a good agreement with other PBE calculations (5.509 ˚A) [40] and experiment [39]. The lat- tice parameters calculated by us along with the corre- sponding literature values can be found in the SI. For the common cells created, Li2O2(001)/TiC(111), Na2O2(001)/TiC(111) and NaO2(001)/TiC(111), we cal- culated a misﬁt factor η = (1− 2Ω Ω+A)∗100%, as deﬁned by Wang et al. [22], and an area ratio α = A Ω, where Ωis the surface area of TiC(111) (32.597 ˚A2) and A is the origi- nal surface area of Li2O2(001) (34.543 ˚A2), Na2O2(001) (33.237 ˚A2) and NaO2(001) (30.484 ˚A2). We found a compression and a relatively small η of 2.90% and 0.97% and α of 1.06 and 1.02 for the Li2O2(001)/TiC(111) and Na2O2(001)/TiC(111), respectively, and an ex- pansion with η of −3.35% and α of 0.94 for the NaO2(001)/TiC(111) cell. To obtain the lowest energy structures of the molecules in the gas-phase, we selected reasonable geometries, such as linear, square, triangle and rhombus for Li2O2 and Na2O2 molecules, and linear and triangle for the NaO2 molecule to be optimized. We found that the lowest en- ergy structures for the Li2O2 and Na2O2 molecules are the planar rhombus, in which two O and two Li (Na) atoms are at opposite corners with Li−O (Na−O) bond lengths of 1.74 ˚A (2.08 ˚A) and O−O bond lengths of 1.59 ˚A (1.60", "page": 2, "position": 1}

This structure is in a good agreement with the results reported by Lau et al. [41] for the Li2O2 molecule.

Adsorption energies We have calculated the adsorption energy per molecule as: En ad1 = (En*mol/TiC tot −nEmolecule tot −ETiC tot )/n (1) where n is the number of molecules in the system and En*mol/TiC tot , Emolecule tot and ETiC tot correspond to the to- tal energies of the lowest energy structures for: nM2O2 and nMO2 molecules on the non-oxidized and oxidized TiC(111) slabs, a single gas-phase molecule, and the TiC slabs, respectively.

For example, Ead1 decreases with increasing coverage of molecules on the TiC(111) surface, from −10.00 eV to −5.87 eV for 1 Li2O2 and 6 Li2O2, respectively. This trend can be explained by the following argument: The larger value of Ead1 at n=1,2 is due to the direct bind- ing of the molecules with the highly reactive Ti sur- face atoms. When increasing the number of molecules in the system, En ad1 tends to decrease as the additional molecules are adsorbed on top of the ﬁrst molecular layer and are not in the direct contact with the TiC surface. Since the interaction between molecular layers is weaker than the interaction of the molecules with the clean and reactive TiC surface, a smaller adsorption energy is ob- tained. By contrast, on the oxidized surface, the Ead1 of molecules follow a diﬀerent trend and are in the range of −1.55 eV to −3.19 eV for nLi2O2, from −2.48 eV to −3.24 eV for nNa2O2 and −1.45 eV to −2.21 eV for nNaO2 systems. This behavior shows that the oxygen layer eﬀectively passivates the TiC surface.

Another important obser- vation from Figure 2 is that after two molecular layers (density of 0.12 [1/˚A2]), the adsorption energy for ad- ditional molecules is almost the same for the clean and oxidized surfaces for all the three AMO species.

The formation of the layered structures due to the creation of O−Ti bonds and the complete break of the molecu- lar O−O bonds can be explained by the strong binding of the O atoms with the reactive Ti-terminated surface. Full molecular (2 molecules,0.06 [1/˚A2]) coverage of the TiC(111) by 2 M2O2 and 2 MO2 leads to the expansion of the ﬁrst O layer relative to a partial coverage, for exam- ple the Ti−O bond lengths of 2 Li2O2/TiC(111) increase by 0.18 ˚A compared with 1 Li2O2/TiC(111).

The displacements are more signiﬁcant for the nNaO2 molecules compared with the nLi2O2 and the nNa2O2 molecules because of the diﬀer- ent stoichiometry. An addition of the next two molecules (n = 5 and 6 with the density of 0.15 [1/˚A2] and 0.18 [1/˚A2]) leads to large atomic displacements of the M/O/M layers, except for the ﬁrst O layer bound to the TiC(111) surface. The M−O, O−O and M−M bond lengths of the distorted structures are shorter compared with the ordered struc- tures. To summarize this part, it is possible to say that ini- tially the AMO atoms prefer to follow the atomic posi- tions dictated by the TiC crystal. As more molecules are adsorbed, the structure changes in the direction of the native AMO crystal but more layers are needed to fully reach that. The thickness, D, of the AMO molecular layers, is another parameter which can be compared with the re- spective D of the corresponding compressed AMO crys- tal structure.

We found that for nLi2O2, nNa2O2, and nNaO2 molecules on the pristine TiC(111) surface D is near zero at n = 1 and 2 showing that in the ﬁrst layer all metal atoms are at about the same height, while at n = 3 and 4 D in most cases change only slightly with re- spect to the native crystal, namely by 12−19%, except for 4 Na2O2 and 3 NaO2 systems which change by 38% and 67%, respectively. For the larger systems (at n = 5 and 6) the diﬀerences in D between the adsorbed AMOs and the crystal structures are higher, for example 46% for 6 Li2O2. D. The eﬀect of surface oxidation on the geometry of the adsorbed AMO layers The presence of an oxide layer on the TiC(111) surface, (TiC(111)-O), strongly aﬀects the molecular structures which diﬀer signiﬁcantly from that of the pristine sur- face. Despite the similar trends, such as breaking molecu- lar O−O bonds and structural reassembling, less ordered structures are already formed on the surface at n = 1, as a result of no direct binding with the reactive Ti atoms on the surface. The layer thickness parameter tends to increase com- pared with the value of D on the pristine TiC(111) sur- face for all systems as a result of higher structural distor- tions. This trend can be observed already at n = 1 and 2. One example is D of 0.00 ˚A", "page": 5, "position": 0}

E. d-band shift The analysis of changes in electronic properties can reveal additional details on the eﬀects of molecular ad- sorption on clean and oxygen passivated surfaces. A shift of the center of the d band (ds) of the surface Ti atoms after adsorption can be considered as an im- portant parameter for the interaction of molecules with the Ti-terminated surface. On the basis of the d-band model, proposed by Norskov et. al. [42, 43], ds can be used in explaining the main trends in reactivity of the transition metals, which vary with element, surface structure and alloying [44]. We present the calculated shifts, ds, for the lowest energy systems in Figure 7. As can be expected, the shift in the center of the d states on the TiC(111) surface is larger in most cases than the", "page": 5, "position": 1}

This can be caused either by charge transfer or polarization of the molecules on the surface or both. Examination of the changes in the work function shows that in all systems, there is no clear trend with coverage. This is to be expected as none of the grown crystals is polar and so it is logical to assume that the work function will just oscillate as more layers are grown. IV. SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK In this work we have calculated the adsorption energies of varying coverage of Li2O2, Na2O2 and NaO2 molecules on clean and oxygen passivated TiC(111) surfaces. We showed that all the diﬀerent AMO molecules exhibit a similar behavior and that, as would be expected, adsorp- tion on a clean surface is initially much more favorable energetically than on an oxygen passivated surface. Fur- thermore, we showed that after the deposition of two molecular layers, the adsorption energies at the clean and oxygen passivated surface approach one another (see Fig. 2) and in fact the eﬀect of the surface preparation be- comes almost unimportant. This is mainly because the newly adsorbed molecules are now lying on the previous AMO molecular layers and not on the TiC itself, clean or oxygen passivated. To verify this we have compared the adsorption energies to the crystal growth energy per layer for the respective crystals of Li2O2,Na2O2 and NaO2. We see that these energies are already very close. It should be noted that for the oxygen passivated surface, which is more realistic experimentally, the adsorption energies are close to that of the crystal growth energies already from the ﬁrst molecule for all the AMO species that we checked. The molecules we have checked have the option to ad- sorb at the surface or to self-assemble in solution and form a cluster. Cluster formation energies are not equal to those of crystal growth and can larger at the beginning and smaller at later stages where there are diﬀerent facets for", "page": 8, "position": 0}

Cluster formation energies are not equal to those of crystal growth and can larger at the beginning and smaller at later stages where there are diﬀerent facets for the formed clusters[19]. As discussed before [12] the way Li2O2 is crystallized, surface adsorption vs. solution based self-assembly, is strongly aﬀected by the solvent properties. However, the absolute surface adsorption en- ergy may have some eﬀect as well. It is therefore inter- esting to map and compare those energies for diﬀerent electrode surfaces and check their possible relationship to cell performance.
