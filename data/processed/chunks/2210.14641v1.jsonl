M¨unchen, Germany Abstract Lithium-graphite intercalation compounds (Li-GICs) are by far the most common anode material for modern Li-ion batteries. However, the dielectric response of this material in the electrostatic limit (and its variation depending on the state of charge (SOC)) has not been investigated to a satisfactory degree – neither by means of theory nor by experiment – and especially not for the higher range of SOC. Nevertheless, said dielectric behaviour is a highly desired property, particularly as an input parameter for charged kinetic Monte Carlo simulations – one of the most promising modeling techniques for energy materials. In this work, we make use of our recently published DFTB parametrization for Li-GICs based on a machine-learned repulsive potential in order to overcome the computational hurdles of sampling the long-ranged Coulomb interactions within this material – as experienced by the charge carriers within. This approach is rather novel due to computational cost, but best suited for investigating our speciﬁc property of interest. For the ﬁrst time, we discover a mostly linear dependency of the relative permittivity ϵr on the SOC, from ≈7 at SOC 0% to ≈25 at SOC 100%. In doing so, we also present a straightforward approach that can be used in future research for other intercalation compounds – once suﬃciently fast and long-ranged computational methods – such as linear-scaling DFT, a good DFTB parametrization, or atomic potentials with inbuilt electrostatics – become available. However, while the presented qualitative behaviour is robust and our results compare favourably with the very few experimental studies available, we do stress that the quantitative results are strongly dependent on our estimation of the partial charge transfer from the intercalated Li-ion to the carbon host structure, and need to be veriﬁed by further experiments and other calculations.

INTRODUCTION: The relative permittivity (RP) is one of the deﬁn- ing properties of many materials, as it describes the degree to which the Coulomb interactions between charge carriers are screened within the material compared to vacuum. Especially in older literature, this property is also known as “dielectric constant”, even though it is far from being constant, but de- pendent on temperature, the frequency of probing electric ﬁelds and even the underlying mechanisms in terms of polarizability, conductivity and others.

Li-ions tend to ﬁll up every second layer com- pletely (staging, left), before starting to intercalate into the other half of the layers. However, this behaviour is not global, but occurs in ﬁnite-sized domains (right) and is not expected to be perfect in real systems. During the inter- calation process, the distance between the graphene sheets (interlayer distance) is increased by around 10%. Traditionally, the RP has primarily been of in- terest for insulators, but in recent times it has also been increasingly investigated for conducting ma- terials [1], where it stems from the interaction be- tween a small fraction of the charge carriers and the atoms. The fact that these charge carriers are mo- bile in conducting materials fundamentally changes the way the property and its dependencies need to be understood within these materials, compared with insulators. One group of materials of great interest are lithium-graphite intercalation compounds (Li- GICs), which constitute by far the most common anode material in modern lithium ion batteries. During the charging and discharging cycles of the battery, Li-ions are stored between the layers of the graphite host structures, up to a stoichiometry of LiC6, which traditionally translates to a state of charge (SOC) of 100% and corresponds to one Li- ion above every third C6 ring of the hexagonal base lattice – even though recent studies have shown that overlithiation beyond that point is possible at am- bient conditions [2]. The distribution of the Li-ions for intermediate SOCs is not uniform, but ordered as shown in ﬁg. 1, as ﬁrst explained in [3]. Within the scope of this speciﬁc material, we de- ﬁne the RP we are investigating as “the damping of the electrostatic interaction between two Li-ions or Li-ion vacancies embedded in the material caused by the surrounding charge-carrier density”.

As of note, this is the electrostatic, low-frequency RP, as opposed to what is measured in many experi- ments, which make use of alternating AC-ﬁelds at a vast variety of frequencies [1, 4]. Furthermore, we point out that this speciﬁc property is direc- tionally separated – its contribution in the xy-plane (in this work deﬁned as parallel to the graphene sheets) is expected to be diﬀerent from the contri- bution in z-direction (orthogonal to the graphene sheets). This makes direct comparison with exper- iments performed on graphite powder as opposed to a “perfect” crystal non-trivial – a problem we address in section 3.4. One of the primary motivations for investigating the RP of Li-GICs is the fact that it is a required in- put parameter for including charge in kinetic Monte Carlo simulations (kMCs), which in turn are a cru- cial method for studying charge carrier dynamics in functional energy materials [5, 6, 7, 8]. Long-ranged Coulomb interactions are a necessity when perform- ing kMC on systems, which include charged or par- tially charged particles. For example, Casalegno et al. [9] have shown that not including such interac- tions (as it would be the case when using e.g. force ﬁeld approaches with ﬁnite-size descriptors) causes an error of 14% in the protonic diﬀusion coeﬃcients in doped perovskites. The situation becomes sig- niﬁcantly more complicated when looking at anode and cathode materials, but also electrolytes, per- ovskites in solar cells, and any other type of func- tional materials that involves changes in the den- sity and/or local ordering of charge carriers as part of their intended function. This is due to the fact that the local relative permittivity then is not only inﬂuenced by the “host” material, but also by the charge carriers close by. Therefore, the RP of Li- GICs changes signiﬁcantly depending on", "page": 2, "position": 1}

Beyond the previously outlined interest for charge-kMC, we believe there to be many more valuable applications for the relative permittivity of Li-GICs also at higher levels of the multiscale simulation hierarchy: one such motivation is un- derstanding charge gradients, as they occur dur- ing the fast charging of modern batteries in electric vehicles, and the chemical pressure which leads to plating and dendrite formation inside the batter- ies under certain operational conditions. The latter phenomenon is typically investigated by means of continuum simulations like e.g. by Hein et al. [10], which also rely at least implicitly on knowledge of the dielectric response. Furthermore, a sim- ple model of the charge carrier electrostatics could be used as a physical baseline for otherwise short- ranged machine learning models or cluster expan- sions. Another related ﬁeld is the development of functional materials based on doped graphite [11]. The dielectric behaviour of Li-GICs (and solid materials in general) is signiﬁcantly more com- plicated than the expression “dielectric constant” would suggest, and is governed by vastly diﬀer- ent physics at diﬀerent frequencies of a probing ﬁeld. In the static limit (which this work aims to investigate – the probing ﬁeld is essentially the electrostatic ﬁeld of the intercalated ion itself), no periodic movement (beyond thermal ﬂuctuations) of the electrons is induced. However, this pic- ture changes in the kHZ range, where the entire charge carrier density oscillates with the probing ﬁeld, causing large polarization and large dielectric screening. For example, Chung et al. [1] measured an RP of ϵr = 2100 for highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) and even higher ones for other carbon structures, at 2-10KHz. Moving on to the GHz regime, a balance is reached where the ﬁeld oscillations are too fast for macroscopic bulk cur- rents to build up, and a situation occurs that is arguably similar to the static limit and may serve as comparison for our research.

Hotta et al. [4] put forward a dielectric constant for graphite powder of ϵr ≈15, at 6GHz. Finally, at even higher frequen- cies beyond THz, the electric ﬁeld becomes high enough in energy to excite a signiﬁcant number of electrons, again creating a physically diﬀerent sit- uation with much lower dielectric screening, which converges to transparency in the ω →∞limit. A study by Jellison et al. [12] in the frequency regime of visible light ﬁnds an RP in xy-plane for HOPG of ϵr = 4.21, which, for the previously mentioned reasons, cannot be used as comparison either and is expected to serve as a lower bound in the follow- ing. It is apparent that there is a glaring lack of studies investigating the exact property of inter- est to us, which is – again – the electrostatic di- electric response of a perfect graphite crystal in xy-plane, i.e. parallel to the graphene sheets, as experienced by some internal charge carriers (in this case Li-ions and vacancies). There are some studies available on graphene, either on some sub- strate or quasi-freestanding, with results ranging from ϵr = 2.2 −5.0 by Elias et al. [13] to ϵr = 15.4 by Reed et al. [11], and another study by Bostwick et al. ﬁnding ϵr ≈4.4 [14], none of which can serve as direct comparison to our research either.

METHODOLOGY: 2.1. Computational details: For this study, we used self-consistent-charge Density Functional Tight Binding (SCC- DFTB [21]) as implemented in in DFTB+ [22], with the parametrization developed in our group. The corresponding Slater-Koster ﬁles are available upon request and have been parametrized and tested as described in [23, 24]. The repulsion potential is machine-learned by means of Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) [25]. Geometries have been constructed and analysed by means of the Atomic Simulation Environment (ASE [26]) which we also used as a base frame- work for all force- and energy-calculations, struc- ture relaxations (speciﬁcally using the Broyden- Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (BFGS) algorithm as an optimizer [27]), and transition state calculations. For the latter, we employed the Nudged Elastic Band (NEB, [28]) algorithm with the BFGS opti- mizer and climbing image [29, 30] switched on. For all DFTB calculations, we used a well con- verged k-point density of at least 0.1/˚A for the z- component of the unit cell. The xy size of the cell is large enough to sample at the Gamma point. The SCC-tolerance is 10−6. We employed Fermi ﬁlling with a Fermi temperature of 0.001 Kelvin, as well as a Broyden mixer [31] for convergence acceleration with a mixing parameter of 0.5. All of these set- tings have been tested with regard to convergence for the whole range of SOC. As described in [23], our parametrization is meant to be used with the Lennard-Jones dispersion correction [32] switched on. In terms of supercell size convergence, satisfac- tory convergence of the extracted slopes of the en- ergies relative to the inverse distances (see section 2 for details) is reached at distances of around 15˚A between the periodic images of the sampled areas of the investigated layers (see ﬁg. 2 and ﬁg. 4), a value we reach or exceed with all used supercells.

We point out that convergence of total energies is still not reached at those distances due to the long- ranged nature of the Coulomb interactions, however our property of interest – the previously mentioned slope – is rather robust to total energy shifts of the whole sampled area. Slight further improvements would still be probable with even larger supercells, but due to computation time constraints, and due to the fact that other eﬀects introduce much larger errors to the ﬁnal results, we chose the supercells described in the following sections. 2.2. Derivation of the relative permittivity ϵr from the Coulomb law and discussion of the partial charge transfer: In order to determine the relative permittivity within the system, our approach is to sample the electrostatic interactions between two charge carri- ers inside the system, placed at varying distances from each other. We begin our considerations with the electrostatic energy ECoul of two charge densities ρ1 and ρ2, governed by the Coulomb law ECoul = 1 4πϵ0ϵr · Z Z ρ1 · ρ2 |⃗r1 −⃗r2|dr1dr2 (1) where ϵ0 is the vacuum permittivity. In this work, we chose to approximate the sampled charge carri- ers as point charges, an approximation that is un- problematic for Li-ions, but requires a bit more con- sideration for Li-ion vacancies, which may be more diﬀuse in shape. In this approximation, the expres- sion becomes ECoul = 1 4πϵ0 · Q1 · Q2 ϵr · 1 |⃗r1 −⃗r2| (2) which has been rearranged to clearly separate the continuum electrostatic from the geometric quanti- 4", "page": 4, "position": 1}
{"chunk_id": "2210.14641v1_p5_c0", "doc_id": "2210.14641v1", "text": "ties. With the two point charges being Li-ions or Li-ion vacancies intercalated into the graphite host structure, we get ECoul = e2 4πϵ0 · Z2 Li ϵr · 1 R (3) where e is the electron charge, ZLi the partial charge on the Li-ion and R the distance between the two charge carriers. In order to link this Coulomb energy to the potential energy Epot of an entire su- percell (as we obtain from our DFTB calculations), an appropriate reference energy E0 needs to be in- troduced, which is the host structure energy in the limit of R →∞at that speciﬁc stoichiometry. With this we ﬁnally get: Epot = e2 4πϵ0 · Z2 Li ϵr · 1 R + E0 (4) The ﬁrst two terms of this expression can be ac- cessed as the slope of a linear regression, when plot- ting Epot over 1/R. In order to relate said slope to ϵr, we approximate ECoul ≈Epot −E0. While this obviously holds in the macroscopic limit for a homogeneous medium, here we are attempting to measure the Coulombic repulsion felt by two par- ticles on a potential energy surface (PES) resolved at the atomistic level. The latter is not inﬁnitely smooth, but presents minima, maxima and saddle points due to the carbon host structure. It how- ever shows a suﬃciently regular pattern (as shown in [24]) to assume that analogous points (i.e., com- paring minima with minima etc.) exhibit analogous local shape. Consistently, the DFTB total energy is indeed expressed (within the formalism of the method [33]) as a sum of three contributions: the so-called band structure energy, the Coulomb en- ergy (the expression of which depends explicitly on the partial charges on the individual atoms, vide infra), and the repulsive energy. Ideally, we can iso- late the Coulomb energy between two particles in the system by considering “the rest of the DFTB to- tal energy” as a background to subtract pointwise, assuming that it will be similar enough in similar local environments. Ideally, this would correspond to the limit for inﬁnitely dilute, unperturbed PES, where the Coulombic interaction between", "page": 5, "position": 0}

Ideally, this would correspond to the limit for inﬁnitely dilute, unperturbed PES, where the Coulombic interaction between charge carriers vanishes. In this light, for each sampled point we may identify a suitable (pointwise) refer- ence E0 as the corresponding point on such unper- turbed PES, e.g., in the case of minima, the total energy of a minimum at the center of any C6 ring of the graphitic host suﬃciently far away from the other charge carrier. We point out that this approximation neglects distortions of the local structure and electron den- sity that may be caused by two charge carriers being close together – an approximation that holds well for the low SOC regime, but not quite as well for the high SOC regime, as will be shown. The ref- erence energy E0 does not impact that slope, but only causes an up or down shift along the y-axis. Therefore, it is not immediately relevant for the ex- traction of the ϵr, but it is needed for consistent plotting of the Coulomb energy. For this reason, we estimate E0 by interpolating the slope to the 1/R →0 limit (see the following chapters for more details). The only other variable that is left, then, is the partial charge of the intercalated lithium ZLi. It is known that, upon intercalation, the electron den- sity of the Li-atom is partially transferred to the carbon host structure, leaving the intercalant as something usually denominated as Li+, but the ex- act magnitude of said charge transfer is hard to pin- point – and not an observable. The self-consistent- charge cycles of our DFTB+ calculations output a local electron population of around 0.21 to 0.26 for the Li-intercalants depending on the local environ- ment of the respective Li-ion, which corresponds to a partial", "page": 5, "position": 1}

[34] pointed out the large dependency of the partial charge transfer on the method of anal- ysis and presented values of 0.43e (Mulliken charge analysis), 0.47e (Voronoy), 0.6e (L¨owdin) and 1.0e (Bader). Krishnan et al. [35] found 0.86e, also by Bader analysis. Song et al. [36] determined 0.68e by means of quantum mechanical calculations and comparison with experimental layer spacing, but also pointed out that this value may change with SOC. Finally, Rakotomahevitra et al. [37] calcu- lated 0.517e, using an extra-orbital model. To com- plicate things further, ϵr depends on ZLi quadrati- cally (see eq. (4)) and is therefore very sensitive to it. For consistency, we will move forward in this work assuming ZLi = 0.765 ± 0.05 – the me- dian partial charge to which the SCC converges. The latter indeed directly enters the expression for the Coulombic contribution to the DFTB total en- ergy, as mentioned before, and therefore represents a natural choice within the framework (and within the approximations) of DFTB. We add a generous, but arbitrary measure of uncertainty, and we stress again that all absolute numbers for the relative per- mittivity ϵr presented in this work need to be un- derstood with this assumption in mind. However, the same is not true for the electrostatic screening (captured by the slopes of the linear regression) – this can be taken at face value and may be, depend- ing on the model or method employed, the more valuable property to take into account for future research. 3. RESULTS & DISCUSSION: 3.1. Lithium-intercalant pairwise interaction screening (xy-plane): In order to sample the pairwise Li-ion interac- tions within the material, we construct an investi- gated layer (called inv(Li), consisting of 300 carbon atoms and two Li-ions, one of them ﬁxed in the cor- ner, the other one sampling a number of diﬀerent positions, as schematically illustrated in ﬁg. 2.

We also perform nudged elastic band (NEB) cal- culations between all combinations of two relaxed structures, which have directly adjacent occupied Li-positions, thus acquiring 41 transition states (per data point) of diﬀusive next-neighbour jumps. This is especially relevant for kinetic Monte Carlo ap- plications, where the dynamics is governed by the rates (and therefore, the activation barriers) corre- sponding to elementary processes bringing the sys- tem from one state to another. As our results show, the Coulombic behaviour we get is identical (within method accuracy) for both cases (ﬁg. 2). This jus- tiﬁes the application of simpliﬁed rescaling rules solely based on Coulombic interactions to include the eﬀect of next-neighbour occupations on the el- ementary barriers, allowing to set up a charged kMC model with one, simple, elementary barrier (the jump of one Li-ion from one site to another in the inﬁnitely dilute limit), and correcting the latter depending on the number and distance of nearest neighbours as well as on the direction of the jump. By plotting the estimated Coulomb energies ECoul = Epot −E0 as functions of the (inverse) dis- tance between the two Li-ions in the investigated layer, we clearly illustrate how our model captures the Coulombic nature of the interaction close to perfectly in the case where no other Li-ions are present in the adjacent layers (ﬁg. 3, blue) that could distort the electron density. The very mi- nor scatter in this case likely stems from the small distortions in the carbon structure close", "page": 6, "position": 1}

Vacancy pairwise interaction screening (xy- plane): It is clear that it is not possible to investigate SOCs close to 100% following the same approach, i.e. using the same investigated layer described in the previous chapter. Furthermore, for the higher SOCs, the diﬀusion mechanism transitions towards vacancy hopping instead of Li-intercalant hopping. Therefore, we introduce a second type of inves- tigated layer (ﬁg. 4), which samples the pairwise Coulomb interactions between Li-vacancies within a ﬁlled layer instead (called inv(Vac)). A key diﬀer- ence here is the fact that, in a ﬁlled layer, only every third C6 ring is occupied by a Li-ion, so the inves- tigated vacancies cannot be placed on each C6-ring, but only on every third one. Due to this, a slightly larger cell is needed (384 carbon atoms) in order to sample a reasonable number of data points (15 per SOC), while also keeping the separation from the periodic image large enough to be well converged. Another consequence of this is the fact that the diﬀusion path from one vacancy location to another 7", "page": 7, "position": 1}

Especially, the data points at “medium” distance (≈8˚A in the left plot or ≈0.125 1/˚A in the right plot of ﬁg. 5) have lower energy than ex- pected if it was purely governed by the Coulomb law. As pointed out before, this is to be expected within our approximations, since a combination of multiple eﬀects are at play here, that can not be addressed without explicit treatment of the over- lapping local environments of the charge carriers: ﬁrstly, for these compositions, there is not just vac- uum present in the space between the investigated sites (as it", "page": 8, "position": 0}

This additional charge density be- tween the sampled sites seems to have an additional stabilizing eﬀect in our DFTB calculations. For va- cancy pairs at distances larger than ≈10˚A, this ef- fect probably becomes negligible again, since there is hardly any interaction energy left to be screened at those distances. Secondly, the point-charge ap- proximation may be less accurate for a Li-vacancy, than it is for a Li-ion, since the next-neighbour local minima within the host structure are not occupied either. And thirdly, upon inspection of the fully re- laxed structures, one realizes that the Li-ions adja- cent to the investigated vacancies are not located in the middle of their respective C6 ring, but slightly displaced towards the vacancy. Due to these addi- tional eﬀects, ﬁtting the potential energies found for these conﬁgurations to the unperturbed Coulomb law (ECoul = Epot −E0) is a more severe approxi- mation in the context of the inv(Vac) investigated layer than it was for the inv(Li) investigated layer. Finally, the slopes and relative permittivities ϵr are summarized in table 2, analogous to section 3.1. 8", "page": 8, "position": 1}

Dilute adjacent layers: One of the complications when investigating Li- GICs is the fact that the same stoichiometry can be realized in a variety of diﬀerent ways, and while it is known that staged conﬁgurations are favoured in equilibrium and in perfect crystals, other – dilute – conﬁgurations may still play a role, when the sys- tem is under the eﬀects of defects, grain boundaries or nonequilibrium states caused by fast charging. Because of this, we choose to investigate some of these conﬁgurations, as well. For this purpose, we make use of the same investigated layers as before, but combine them with an adjacent layer, that is dilutely ﬁlled at 50% capacity. In order to realize the periodicity of said layer, a slightly larger cell with 360 carbon atoms is necessary in the case of the Li-ion investigated layer. As expected, this dilutely ﬁlled adjacent layer causes a larger scatter of the potential energies of the individual conﬁgurations, which is due to the less even electron density of such a layer com- pared to a completely empty or full one. In the inv(Vac) −dilute case, this eﬀect is also combined with the already larger scatter we observed and ex- plained previously when sampling this type of inves- tigated layer.", "page": 9, "position": 0}

We tried to mitigate this by also sam- pling over two diﬀerent orientations of the dilute adjacent layers – averaging out the uneven electron density – but the scatter remains very large, which leads to a much larger uncertainty of the resulting slope and relative permittivity ϵr (see table 3). Nevertheless, the Coulombic nature of the inter- action is still clearly visible despite the scatter at least for the inv(Li) −dilute case (ﬁg. 6, left), and is expected to be captured by the (admittedly rough) linear ﬁt in the other case as well – yet of course with a larger uncertainty. Indeed, the resulting slope is still in line with the overall behaviour we ﬁnd throughout the whole system. 3.4.

However, real graphite anodes and experimental samples of- ten come in powder form, with graphite nanopar- ticles in random spatial orientation. Experimental measurements of the dielectric behaviour of such samples cannot be directly compared to the results we have presented so far. Therefore, we also inves- tigate the dielectric behaviour in z-direction (per- pendicular to the graphene sheets). In order to do so, we construct a 15-layered su- percell with a stoichiometry of Li2C720 which cor- responds to an SOC of 1.7%. We sample 5 of the 15 layers (to ensure no self-interaction with the pe- riodic image) with one pair of Li-ions, placed in po- sitions both directly above each other and shifted by one next-neighbour position (those latter inter- actions are not perfectly in z-direction, but still “through” the graphene sheets). As can be seen, the resulting electrostatic behaviour is not purely Coulombic (see ﬁg. 7).

Holding on to the as- sumption of a linear trend, a linear ﬁt ﬁnds a slope of 0.411 ± 0.054, which translates to a relative per- mittivity of ϵz = 21.35 ± 5.50 – signiﬁcantly larger than the in-plane relative permittivity ϵxy we ﬁnd at similar SOC. Based on this, we can average over the 3 spatial dimensions in order to provide a rough estimate of the relative permittivity ϵr of randomly oriented graphite powder at very low SOC, simply by applying: ϵr = (2ϵxy + ϵz)/3 = 11.93 (5) This result is comparable to the ϵr ≈15 found by Hotta et al. [4] in the GHz range, but again, it is not entirely clear that this comparison is physically valid. Once a more reliable consensus is reached in experiment, our estimation of the partial charge can be further validated. It is also necessary to point out that grain-boundary and grain-size eﬀects may play a signiﬁcant role, especially the smaller the particles in the powder get, but these eﬀects are not considered at all in the numbers we present here – those are simply intended to help with comparison between our results and experiments. 3.5. Relative permittivity ϵr as a function of the SOC: Putting the previous results together (see ﬁg. 8), we ﬁnd an approximately linear dependency of the relative permittivity ϵr (in the xy-plane) on the SOC of the Li-GIC.

The weighted linear ﬁt outputs the expression ϵr(S OC) = 6.8 + 18.2 · S OC. The ﬁnal uncertainty intervals are translated through eq. (4) and stem from a combination of our (arbitrarily chosen) uncertainty in the partial charge ZLi (as described in the methodology sec- tion) and the root mean square error (RMSE) of the slope, which is returned by the linear regres- sion and caused by scatter around the Coulombic behaviour, which in turn is due to variations in the electron densities of adjacent layers, local struc- tural perturbations and similar eﬀects not captured by the approximations we made when introducing ECoul ≈Epot −E0 (as described throughout the pre- vious sections), as well as the intrinsic limited ac- curacy of DFTB. 4. CONCLUSION: With this work, we present the ﬁrst rigorous in- vestigation of the dielectric behaviour of lithium graphite intercalation compounds (Li-GICs) for the entire functional range of charge during the appli- cation as anode of a modern Li-ion battery. In do- ing so, we provide a straightforward approach for investigating the intrinsic relative permittivity of materials with mobile charge carriers in the elec- trostatic limit, that can be applied to other ma- terials in the future – given that suﬃciently fast and long-ranged computational methods are avail- able. Thanks to our recently published DFTB parametrization [23, 24], we are able to sample the long-ranged Coulomb interactions between two in- tercalated charge carriers (Li-ions or vacancies) in a variety of stoichiometries and conﬁgurational real- izations thereof. By examining the approximations we made during this process, we additionally out- line ways to further improve this methodology in the future. The primary ﬁnding of this work is the mostly lin- ear dependency (from ϵr ≈7 at SOC 0% to ϵr ≈25 at SOC 100%) of the relative permittivity on the state of charge, which we put forward for the ﬁrst time. With this, we make valuable contributions 12", "page": 12, "position": 0}

Our results hold for qualitatively diﬀer- ent realizations of the intermediate stoichiometries (staged or dilute), as well as both possible types of diﬀusion (Li-ion or vacancy). The few available ex- perimental studies agree reasonably well with our results, but more investigation is necessary to re- ally pinpoint the quantitative dielectric response, especially at higher SOC. Thanks to our results, it is now clear that only two measurements – one at low and one at high SOC – would suﬃce for that purpose. We ﬁnd that an approximation neglecting the lo- cal distortions of the structure and of the electron density caused by the sampled charge carriers holds very well if those charge carriers are Li-ions, and slightly less well, but still within reason, in the va- cancy case. Future improvements could be achieved by correcting with some local descriptor based ma- chine learning model that is speciﬁcally trained to pick up those local eﬀects. Additionally, we provide a rough estimate (grain- boundary eﬀects are neglected, but should be uni- form with space direction and therefore should not have any qualitative impact on our results) on how the relative permittivity of a perfect crystal and a powder can be compared, or relatedly, of how an ex- perimental result for (intercalated) graphite powder can be translated to the internal xy-plane relative permittivity the Li-ions feel locally (which is the one that is actually relevant for their diﬀusion be- haviour). 5.
