Andritsos∗ Department of Physics, King’s College London, Strand, London, WC2R 2LS, UK Kevin Rossi† Laboratory of Nanochemistry for Energy, Institute of Chemistry, Ecole Polytechnique F´ed´erale de Lausanne, Lausanne, 1015, CH Unlocking the design of Li-S batteries where no shuttle eﬀects appears, and thus their energy storage capacity does not diminish over time, would enable the manufacturing of energy storage devices more performant than the current Li-ion commercial ones. Computational screening of Li-polysulphide (LiPS) adsorption on single-atom catalyst (SAC) substrates is of great aid to the design of lithium–sulphur batteries which are robust against the LiPS shuttling from the cathode to the anode and the electrolyte. To aid this process, we develop a machine learning protocol to accelerate the systematic mapping of dominant local minima found with DFT calculations, and, in turn, fast screen LiPS adsorption properties on SACs. We ﬁrst validate the approach by probing the potential energy surface for Li-polysulphides adsorbed on graphene decorated with a Fe SAC bound to four nitrogen atoms. We identify minima whose binding energy is better or on par with the one previously reported in the literature. We then move to analyse the adsorption trends on Zn–N4– CSAC and observe similar adsorption strength and behaviour with the Fe–N4–C SAC, highlighting the good predictive power of our protocol. I. INTRODUCTION Lithium–sulphur (Li–S) batteries are an emerging technology in the ﬁeld of energy storage. Their high- density energy storage capacity, of ∼2500 W h kg−1 the- oretical speciﬁc energy [1], is indeed much higher than that of Li-ion or other commercial batteries. However, in practice, the Li–S battery rate capability and life cy- cle degrades severely over time because of the so called “shuttle” eﬀect. The latter is caused by lithium poly- sulphide (LiPS) molecules remaining in the electrolyte during the charge–discharge process, leading to loss of active material and reduced battery performance. Controlling the LiPS rate of migration to the anode and the reaction kinetics in the cathode is important for tackling the issue of the “shuttle” eﬀect. Several", "page": 0, "position": 0}

The latter is caused by lithium poly- sulphide (LiPS) molecules remaining in the electrolyte during the charge–discharge process, leading to loss of active material and reduced battery performance. Controlling the LiPS rate of migration to the anode and the reaction kinetics in the cathode is important for tackling the issue of the “shuttle” eﬀect. Several strate- gies have been adopted to reduce the diﬀusivity of LiPS to the electrolyte, mainly focusing on the development of cathode host materials that can strongly bind the LiPS while also improving the reaction kinetics [2–4]. However, regardless of the vast amount of research in the ﬁeld over the recent years, prevention of battery degradation still remains a challenge. To overcome the issue, recent studies focus on single- atom catalyst (SAC) materials. The latter provide strong polysulphide adsorption and improve the reaction kinet- ics, thanks to their exceptional electrocatalytic proper- ties. Recent studies indeed suggest that SAC with atom- ically dispersed transition metals (TMs) on graphene lat- tices are particularly promising candidates. In particu- ∗lefteri.andritsos@kcl.ac.uk † kevin.rossi@epﬂ.ch lar, calculations on the eﬀect of SACs with TM–N4–C formation (TM = Co, Fe, Mn, Ru, V, W, Zn, and C as a graphene lattice) on the LiPS adsorption, the Gibbs free energy change and the reaction activation barrier [5–13], predict a remarkable improvement in the cathode prop- erties which could potentially reduce the LiPS “shuttle” eﬀect. Numerical methods provide ground to screen SAC ad- sorption properties. The identiﬁcation of the global en- ergy minimum LiPS-SAC structure, a stepping stone to predict adsorption trends, is however rather challenging. Several diﬀerent initial guess structures and structural optimisations have to be considered in order to identify the global minimum structure. For example, in high- order LiPS intermediates (Li2S4, Li2S6 and Li2S8) the ﬁnal binding energies varies over 0.5 eV [14] depending on the initial LiPS structure that is used as input in the relaxation. By the same token, reported values of Li2S6 binding energy on Fe-based SAC, one of the most exam- ined SAC material", "page": 0, "position": 1}

For example, in high- order LiPS intermediates (Li2S4, Li2S6 and Li2S8) the ﬁnal binding energies varies over 0.5 eV [14] depending on the initial LiPS structure that is used as input in the relaxation. By the same token, reported values of Li2S6 binding energy on Fe-based SAC, one of the most exam- ined SAC material for Li–S batteries, vary by about 0.6 eV, from −0.9 eV to −1.5 eV [5, 7, 9, 13]. The large discrepancy in the results, raises concerns regarding the quality of the protocols adopted to identify the minimum energy structure, and adds uncertainty when comparing SAC results from diﬀerent studies. Here, we demonstrate the use of machine learning (ML) methods to accelerate the prediction of LiPS bind- ing energies on SAC materials. In particular, we develop a protocol which hinges on a supervised/unsupervised machine learning strategy, in combination with density functional theory (DFT) calculations, to eﬃciently screen the stable structures of Li2Sn (n = 1, 2, 4, 6, 8) on TM– N4–C (TM = Fe, Zn) anchoring materials.

We then show that by relaxing these structures we iden- tify SAC/LiPS geometries whose binding energy is on-par or lower with those reported in the literature. We thus demonstrate how machine learning methods of diﬀerent nature can accelerate the systematic identiﬁcation of the energetically favourable LiPS/SAC substrate geometries. The proposed approach gauges on the recent advances in ML methods applied to the modelling of catalysts and materials for energy applications [15, 16]. While applica- tion of ML methods emerged as a new paradigm to ac- celerate the exploration of complex interactions between small and medium molecules with a variety of binding sites, [17–19] data-driven approaches in the ﬁeld of Li– S batteries still remain too under-exploited [20]. ML modelling in Li–S batteries has been used to examine the impact of materials and battery design on the bat- tery performance [21], and the LiPS adsorption on two- dimensional layer-structured MoSe2 and WSe2 by calcu- lating the binding energy of LiPSs for arbitrary spacial conﬁgurations at random sites on the host material [22]. A recent study also combined a machine learning frame- work, based on a modiﬁed Crystal Graph Convolutional Neural Network and DFT calculations to oﬀer rational design of SACs for Li–S batteries [23]. The authors fo- cus mainly on the low-order LiPS and S8 to reveal the binding energy pattern of LiPSs on a wide range of SACs. II.

Database construction: (a) Firstly, we deﬁne a supercell space and relax the forces on atoms in the LiPS and in the SAC, each considered as an isolated system, at DFT level. This ensures that the LiPS and SAC structure are more likely to be energeti- cally favourable when modelling LiPS adsorp- tion on the SAC. (b) We deﬁne a 3D grid in the supercell, where translations of the LiPS will be placed. The grid spacing is 0.5 ˚A along the plane parallel to the substrate, and 0.25 ˚A along the axis per- pendicular to the substrate. For each transla- tion we apply rotation of 10◦in the solid angle centred at the centre of mass of the polysul- phide, and obtain the full set of structures. The ﬁnal number roto-translation is reduced and diﬀers for each LiPS, as we apply cutoﬀ criteria so that no LiPS atom is closer than 1.5 ˚A to atoms in the substrate. 2. Reference Force-Energy calculations: (a) We map each structure generated in the previ- ous step into a high dimensional feature space. The latter is deﬁned through a Smooth Over- lap of Atomic Orbitals (SOAP) representation [24], employing seven angular and six radial components and a radial cut-oﬀof 6.5 ˚A. (b) We then select a maximum of 10% of the most diﬀerent structures, in terms of SOAP rep- resentation, within the full set of LiPS roto- translations along the substrate, by means of a furthest point sampling (FPS) algorithm [25].

Minimise GCH Vertexes: We perform DFT geome- try optimisation to the structures which lie at ver- texes of the GCH. We make this choice under the heuristic hypothesis that vertexes of the GCH are the most likely to relax into dissimilar low-energy structures.[28] A. Materials In this study, we examine two SAC materials with TM–N4–C formation (TM = Fe, Zn) and ﬁve LiPS in- termediates (Li2Sn, n = 1, 2, 4, 6, 8). The TM–N4–C conﬁgurations, based on a modiﬁed 72-atom relaxed pris- tine graphene lattice, consist of 66 C atoms (92.96 at%), four substitutional N atoms (5.63 at%) and one intersti- tial TM atom (1.41 at%). The TM and two N atoms were manually shifted out of plane by 0.5 ˚A and 0.3 ˚A, respectively, in order to realistically represent the previ- ously observed geometry in SAC materials, when LiPSs are present [7, 9]. The top and side views of the TM–N4– C, and the relaxed LiPS structures are shown in Figure 2. B. DFT set up We perform all spin-polarised DFT simulations with the CASTEP code [29]. We calculate the exchange and correlation potential using the generalised gradient ap- proximation (GGA) with the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) functional, using plane-wave cut-oﬀenergy of 500 eV. We use energy and force convergence criteria of 10−5 eV and 5×10−5 eV/˚A respectively for the self-consistent ﬁeld (SCF) for single-point and geometry optimisation simulations, and 10−5 eV and 10−3 eV/˚A respectively, for the geometry optimisation simulations. The sampling of the Brillouin zone is carried on a Monkhorst-Pack grid, using a 3×3×1 k-point mesh. We include Van der Waals dispersion corrections as described in Grimme’s empirical method. [30] We consider periodic boundaries conditions in the simulation box and a vacuum separation distance of 18 ˚A at the direction normal to the substrate’s surface to avoid replica interaction.

SOAP Representation Each conﬁguration consisting of a LiPS and the SAC is described by means of D features deriving from the Smooth Overlap of Atomic Orbitals representation [24]. This representation is smooth, invariant to permutations, rotations, and translations of the system. Within the SOAP representation, structures are en- coded by means Gaussian smeared atomic densities ex- panded via orthonormal functions, based on spherical harmonics and radial basis functions, centred at atoms positions. Operatively, the SOAP power spectrum is cal- culated as: pZ1,Z2 n,n′,l = π r 8 2l + 1 X m cZ1 n,l,m ∗cZ2 n′,l,m (2) where n and n′ are the indices for the radial basis func-", "page": 2, "position": 1}

To calculate the SOAP power spectra we adopt the DSCRIBE [31] library, and utilise the following param- eters: nmax = 6 , lmax = 7 , and rcut = 6.5˚A . After calculating the power spectrum associated to each atomic sites in a structure, we evaluate an average power spec- trum which is associated to the atomic conﬁguration. We utilise the elements in the averaged p power spec- ture as the features in kernel ridge regression (KRR). SOAP power spectrum coeﬃcients,[32–35] and local- density expansion coeﬃcients more in general,[36–39] have been largely successful features in kernel-based and linear machine learning models for structure classiﬁcation and energy regression D. Kernel Ridge Regression KRR is a well-known and popular non-parametric re- gression approach. In particular, it consists of L2-norm regularised least squares ﬁtting which exploits the kernel trick [26], where the latter allows for an eﬃcient frame- work to transform and compare data in an high number dimensions. Within the framework of kernel methods, data are represented by a matrix of pairwise similarity where each (i, j) entry is deﬁned by the kernel function k(xi, xj). The latter returns the dot product of the fea- tures vectors associated to each i and j data point in the projected space, for any mapping φ : x →RN. The kernel trick thus allows for operations in a high dimen- sional space without the explicit need of calculating φ(x).

Given a set of covariate variables xi, the KRR prediction f(xi) is written as a linear combination [40]: f(xi) = N X i=1 αi k(xi, x) (4) and the vector of αi weights is found by solving: α = (K + λI)−1 · y, (5) where K is the kernel matrix, λ tunes the regulari- sation strength and y labels response variables in the training set. In the reported case study we choose λ to 0.025 and a radial basis function kernel to evaluate the Ki,j elements of the K matrix. E. Generalized Convex Hull The generalised convex hull (GCH) allows to evaluate the probabilities of structures being stabilised by general thermodynamic constraints. In a nutshell, the convex hull of a ﬁnite number of points is deﬁned as the smallest convex set that contains them. In materials science, the convex hull construction is used to identify structures that are stable. Given a set of energies, as a function of one or more thermodynamic variables, only the conﬁgurations which lie at the ver- texes of the convex hull which are lower in energy will be stable. If a structure does not lie on one of such vertexes it is unstable with respect to decomposition into two or more parent structures (assuming ﬁxed thermodynamic conditions and disregarding possible stabilization due to kinetic eﬀects). The generalized convex hull construction adopts a ge- ometric ﬁngerprints Φ = {Φi}, to encode the full struc- tural diversity of a dataset of conﬁgurations, rather than one or more explicit thermodynamic variables to predict stable phases. The GCH framework has been success- fully used in the past for predicting previously unseen ice phases [41] and molecular crystals polymorphs [28].

Figure 3A shows a 2D map where the two axes are the ﬁrst and second principal components of the SOAP features, associated to all structures generated for this system. Each point in the map corresponds to one of those structures. The colour scale refers to the order with which structures have been generated during the systematic enumeration of LiPS roto-translations. Points in black corresponds to structures selected via an heuris- tic FPS scheme where on the SOAP features for each structure and an Euclidean metric where considered to evaluate the distance between diﬀerent structures. We repeat the same process for the other LiPS molecules and run DFT-based single point calculation on the ﬁrst ∼10% most diﬀerent structures (i.e., circa 2720 out of 27,200 structures per each LiPS), and utilise the ∼80% of that data as the training dataset in the Kernel Ridge regression ﬁtting.

All relaxed LiPS struc- tures have a S atom located on/near the top of the TM atom, while the Li atoms are located closer to the sub- strate. This is veriﬁed by an atomic distance analysis, reported in Table II, describing the shortest Li–TM and S–TM distances for each LiPS molecule corresponding to the lowest energy structure. The distance between Li atoms and the TM is always smaller than the one be- tween the S atoms and the TM. The closest S–TM dis- tance decreases for high order LiPSs, while the opposite is observed for the closest Li–TM distance. The tendency of the TM in “pulling” the S atoms closer while “push- ing” the Li atoms away is in agreement with our previous report in the literature [13]. IV.

The shortest Li–TM distances behave similarly for either Zn and Fe- based SACs, although these are generally shorter when Zn is present. In contrast, the shortest reported S–TM distances for the two systems follow an opposite trend. When Zn is present the S–TM distance tends to increase as the LiPS order increases, and, generally, the distances Top view Side view FIG. 6.

Based on the above, we can conclude that Zn tends to prefer Li bonding for high order LiPSs. This can potentially improve the conversion rate at that stage.

For Li2S, Li2S2and Li2S8, where the initial unre- laxed conﬁgurations are not lying in the same vertex for the two diﬀerent SACs, the ﬁnal relaxed conﬁgurations are minimising into similar conﬁgurations, as shown in Figures 5 and 6. It is a matter of debate whether best LiPS conﬁgu- rations found for a given substrate could be translated to other systems of similar nature. Our results suggest that relaxing a LiPS-SAC conﬁguration which resulted in lower binding energy for the case of a given TM, is likely, yet not always, to lead to favourable conﬁgurations when substituting the TM itself. More robust approaches to identify putative minimum energy conﬁgurations, like the one here proposed, are thus necessary towards more accurate predictions. For completeness in the discussion on the computa- tional costs associated with he discussed protocol, we display the number of DFT relaxation steps necessary in our workﬂow for each Zn-LiPS system in Table IV. In particular, we report the total number of relaxation steps required in this workﬂow, including the single-point cal- culations necessary during the “Reference Force-Energy calculations” step, and the structure relaxation calcula- tions of all GCH vertexes during the “Minimise GCH Vertexes” step.

We recognise that the computational cost of DFT-based calculations widely depends on mul- tiple system and software dependent factors, hence ef- fective cross-reference comparison is not trivial. Addi- tionally, the computational cost per DFT relaxation step varies when using self-consistent functionals, hence time comparison would not be immediately insightful. How- ever, it is heuristically observed that the total number of steps required for system relaxation, for structures with the same simulation parameters and conﬁguration, can identify the level of disorder or system complexity of the initial structure. The standard approach of manually, and often ar- bitrarily, constructing the LiPS/SAC conﬁguration is known to be ineﬀective and often might not correspond to the most energetically favourable structure, unless exces- sive testing is performed. On one hand we cannot exclude that other minima searches methods, e.g. via genetic al- gorithm approaches, will ﬁnd minima structures compet- itive with those found in this study. On the other we note that these more extensive searches, involving hun- dreds or thousands structural relaxations, rather than tens of structural relaxations as in the proposed proto- col, would result in much larger computational costs and practically unusable. However, we argue that the work- ﬂow under examination proposes a good set of candidate structures and oﬀers a fair balance between accuracy and computational eﬃciency. V. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS The binding energy of LiPSs on TM-N-SAC substrates is a useful descriptor to infer which SAC material is likely to provide an optimal performance in preventing shuttle eﬀects in Li-S batteries. Here, we propose an eﬃcient protocol to identify a likely minimum energy conﬁgura- tion candidate, and thus the most informative binding energy prediction, via a combination of DFT single-point calculations, unsupervised and supervised data-driven al- gorithms, and DFT structure optimisations. The proto- col hinges on: I) the construction of a database of roto- translation of LiPS molecules deposited on a rigid TM-N- SAC substrate, II) the calculation of the", "page": 7, "position": 1}

Here, we propose an eﬃcient protocol to identify a likely minimum energy conﬁgura- tion candidate, and thus the most informative binding energy prediction, via a combination of DFT single-point calculations, unsupervised and supervised data-driven al- gorithms, and DFT structure optimisations. The proto- col hinges on: I) the construction of a database of roto- translation of LiPS molecules deposited on a rigid TM-N- SAC substrate, II) the calculation of the binding energy for a carefully selected number of these, III) the train- ing of a kernel ridge regressor to chart structure-binding energy relationships systematically, IV) the use of a gen- eralised convex hull construction to isolate likely-stable and structurally diverse geometries, V) their ﬁnal opti- misation at DFT level. We benchmark the protocol robustness for the case of LiPS on a Fe SAC and recover binding energies on-par or lower than the ones reported in the literature. We move to analyse the LiPS adsorption properties on a Zn SAC and ﬁnd that the latter systematically displays a strong interaction (i.e. lower binding energies). From a structural perspective, we conﬁrm that the minimum S-TM distances are always lower than the minimum Li- TM distances, for both systems. We further ﬁnd that, regardless of the TM nature, an increase in the nuclear- ity of the LiPS molecule corresponds to a decrease in the S-TM minimum distance and an increase in the Li-TM minimum distance. Interestingly, we note that notwith- standing a change in the transition metal single atom catalysts, the lowest energy relaxed structure often, but not always, originates from a LiPS located and oriented in similar initial position and orientation w.r.t. the sub- strate TM. Few upgrades could further beneﬁt the eﬃciency and accuracy of the search strategy we propose. If deemed necessary, the GCH vertex search can encompass not the ﬁrst PCA component but also high order ones. Further, adopting more complex statistical learning methods (e.g.", "page": 7, "position": 2}

Second, co-regionalised [45] or transfer learning [46] approaches may further beneﬁt the making of more eﬃcient and accurate models when tackling the study of LiPS adsorption on a substrates with many and diverse SACs transition metals. Third, ML approaches could be also adopted to accelerate the minimisation [47– 49] and reduce drastically the number of DFT force-and- energy calculations which are necessary at the ”structure optimisation” stage following the surrogate generalised convex hull construction. Currently, the proposed strat- egy does not aim to replace DFT-based calculations, but rather to guide and speed-up DFT-based searches of LiPS conﬁgurations for strong adsorption on SACs. The ML acceleration of the structural relaxation step could fur- ther diminish the need of DFT single-point calculations by a factor of 2-10. Finally, we remark that the method is general and transferable to study not only other LiPS-substrate in- teractions, but, in principle, also other molecular system - substrate interactions. Here, we demonstrate our proto- col’s transferability by examining the Zn–N4–C SAC, and observing consistent results as in the Fe–N4–C SAC. Con- versely we believe this work will nurture the advancement in minima searches protocols that investigate medium and large molecules adsorption on rigid and soft sub- strates of diverse nature.
