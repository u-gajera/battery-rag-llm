Here, we elucidate the structure, stability, and chemical bond- ing in a-P from first principles, combining machine-learning and density-functional the- ory (DFT) methods. We show that a-P structures exist with a range of energies slightly higher than those of phosphorus nanorods, to which they are closely related, and that the stability of a-P is linked to the degree of structural relaxation and medium-range order. We thus complete the stability range of phosphorus allotropes [Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2014, 53, 11629] by now including the previously poorly understood amorphous phase, and we quantify the covalent and van der Waals interactions in all main phases of phos- phorus. We also study the electronic densities of states, including those of hydrogenated a-P. Beyond the present study, our structural models are expected to enable wider-rang- ing first-principles investigations – for example, of a-P-based battery materials. Introduction Phosphorus is one of the structurally most diverse elements, and its various allotropes continue to attract widespread research interest in chemistry.[1] White phosphorus is the thermodynamic standard state and consists of tetrahedral P4 molecules.[2] Black phosphorus shows a layered structure with buckled six-membered rings held together by van der Waals (vdW) dispersion", "page": 0, "position": 0}

These fragments connect to form perpendicular (parallel) tubular structures in violet (fibrous) phosphorus, re- spectively. Similar cages and tubular networks are found in recently synthesised phosphorus nanorods[7] and nanowires.[8] In addition to the crystalline allotropes, there is a widely-known non-crystalline form, namely, red amorphous phosphorus (a-P).[9] An emerging application for this material is in batteries,[10] based on its ability to form Li–P and Na–P phases that lead to high theoretical capacities of a- P-based anodes, as long as the conductivity and the volumetric change during cycling can be controlled.[11] In terms of structural chemistry, various models have been proposed for a-P, in- cluding two-dimensional structures with layered motifs, similar to those in black phospho- rus;[12] tubular networks containing cage-like motifs, e.g., P8 and P9 fragments;[9b] or a struc- tural model primarily composed of P3 rings and P4 tetrahedra that form extended chains.[13] (We here write “P4” rather than “P4”, for consistency of notation.) However, whilst the crys- talline structures can be accurately characterised in advanced diffraction and imaging experi- ments,[6, 14] a large part of the difficulty in studying a-P is in determining its structure in the first place. Early work using neutron diffraction suggested the existence of P8 or P9 motifs, inferred from a similarity to Hittorf-type fragments,[9b] whereas empirical potential structure refinement based on X-ray diffraction data also implied the presence of P4 tetrahedra.[13] In addition, Ra- man spectroscopy studies suggested the existence of both buckled six-membered rings[15] and cage-like motifs,[16] indicating a rather complex atomic structure of a-P, whose details may well depend on the synthesis conditions.", "page": 1, "position": 0}

[18] and references therein. And yet, just like there are open questions about many crystalline phosphorus allotropes,[1,21] there remain fundamental chemical questions about the amorphous form, a-P. For example, how does the degree of local structural ordering determine the energetic (meta-) stability? What is the chemical-bonding nature, which might be expected to include both strong covalent and weaker dispersion interactions? What is the role of coordination defects? And where does a-P fall within the previously introduced first-principles stability range of the crystalline phospho- rus allotropes?[21] In the present work, we address precisely those questions by using a suite of state-of-the-art computational chemistry techniques: ML-driven molecular-dynamics (MD) simulations, first- principles DFT including many-body-dispersion (MBD) corrections, as well as analyses of electronic structure and orbital interactions. We introduce a series of structural models for a-P and also for its hydrogenated form (a-P:H) – large enough to represent the complex structures, yet small enough to enable full first-principles investigations. We derive new insight into the role of local structural order in the energetic stability of a-P, the nature of defects, and the bal- ance between covalent and vdW dispersion interactions in phosphorus allotropes.", "page": 2, "position": 0}

The protocol followed our earlier work,[18] but the new simulations were now carried out in smaller simulation cells, with the aim to enable subsequent DFT studies, and in three parallel runs.

Our a-P models, after DFT-based structural optimisation, contain mostly three-fold coordinated atoms, in line with standard valence rules; there are only ≈ 1% of over-coordinated (N = 4) and ≈ 2% of under-coordinated atoms (N = 2). There is a different degree of structural ordering in the three a-P models (Figure 1a): 1 shows a more disordered, random network, whereas the arrangement of fragments in 3 follows patterns resembling those in violet and fibrous phospho- rus (viz. tubular networks). Similar to the previously simulated large-scale a-P model,[18] the three models created in this work contain abundant five-membered rings, and more complex cluster fragments that are made up of those (e.g., the P8 cage found in violet and fibrous P consists of four fused five-membered rings). We use the same notation as in Ref. [20] to label those fragments. The distribution of cluster fragments (Figure 1b), together with a similarity in short-range struc- tural features (Figure S1c–d), confirms that our new small-scale models are overall consistent with the previously validated, larger-scale model. A comparatively higher count of P8 and P9 cages in 3 implies a greater similarity with the closely related crystalline forms, violet and fi- brous phosphorus. Such cage-like fragments have also been used as building blocks of predicted phosphorus allotropes with more complex local environments, via a random structure search.[22] No P4 units are observed in 2 and 3, implying pure network, rather than molecular, structures. The overall agreement between the present structures and the one from Ref. [18] underlines that purpose-tailored simulations are possible with ML potentials: enabling ultra-large-scale simu- lations, but also the use of smaller-scale models (e.g., 1–3 in this work) which are accessible to subsequent first-principles DFT analyses of energetics and chemical bonding.", "page": 4, "position": 0}

Among the phases studied, white phosphorus is the least energetically stable (Figure 2). Violet, fibrous, and black phosphorus are all predicted to have close energies, with differences less than 0.3 kJ mol–1, although the structure of black phosphorus differs from that of the other two. In fact, such energetic near-degeneracy is not only seen with HSE06+MBD, but was reported using various DFT methods.[21, 29] Following Ref. [21], we also generated three models of P nanorods (referred to as n1, n2, and n3), by removing the copper and iodine atoms from (CuI)8P12, (CuI)3P12, and (CuI)2P14, respectively, and then relaxing the structures using DFT. These mod- els consist of more complex tubular chains and are energetically less stable than the “textbook” crystalline allotropes. Our a-P models (1 to 3), energetically, sit in between white P and the other crystalline forms, and with increased structural ordering (Figures 1a and S2), the energies of these three models decrease. Table 1 shows that the computed mass densities of different allotropes agree well with experimental data, and the computed energy ranking of the crystal- line forms is consistent with previous studies[21, 23] – our combined ML- and DFT-based simu- lation approach has now allowed us to extend this ranking to the previously poorly understood amorphous form. Bachhuber et al. have previously studied dispersion interactions in phosphorus allotropes, using pairwise dispersion-correction methods available at the time.[32] With advanced MBD correc- tions, we also observe that the vdW contributions to the overall energy vary across the different phosphorus modifications (Table 1): white phosphorus shows the smallest absolute vdW con- tribution (lowering the total energy by about 14 kJ mol–1), whereas black phosphorus has the largest value (≈ 20 kJ mol–1).

These results can be understood from the different interspaces of building fragments in molecular and network solids: in white phosphorus, the P4 tetrahedra are well-separated from each other, and the distance between building units is longer than in other modifications, resulting in smaller dispersion contributions. This result is intuitive in the sense that vdW forces approximately decay with the sixth power of the distance, but it is still notable that the “molecular” solid, P4, is less strongly vdW bonded than any of the black, violet, fibrous, or amorphous forms.

Comparable hydrogenated phases of amorphous silicon (known as “a-Si:H”) have long been studied: the material can be generated under synthesis conditions (e.g., plasma decomposition of silane) in which atomic defects are passivated by hydrogen atoms,[33] leading to varying concentrations of hydrogen and defects in the material.[34] Experiments have shed light on the activation and functionalisation of white phosphorus[35] to form different P-containing species (e.g., organophosphorus compounds);[36] under specific synthesis conditions, P4 tetrahedra break and give rise to unsaturated phosphorus atoms, which readily form new bonds. We here considered hydrogenated models for a-P, fol- lowing a similar idea as in a-Si:H, as unsaturated (N = 2) phosphorus atoms may also be ex- pected to be passivated during synthesis (e.g., when a-P is formed by thermal decomposition of PH3).[37] Figure 3a illustrates the hydrogenation process, starting from pristine a-P (models 1 to 3), and leading to three hydrogenated structures which we label 1H to 3H. We generated these struc- tures as follows: (1) all fourfold connected atoms (≈ 1% of the total atoms in the model) were removed; (2) the valences of all the resulting twofold connected atoms were saturated by adding one additional hydrogen atom to each, forming P–H bonds perpendicular to the two P–P bonds and on the side with more open space; (3) the modified structures were further relaxed using dispersion-corrected DFT (PBE+D3; Methods section). This procedure leaves the connectivity of different cluster fragments intact, whilst ensuring that all P atoms are three-fold connected in the resulting hydrogenated models.", "page": 8, "position": 0}

Upon hydrogenation, all defect states disappeared, increasing the band gaps in all three hydrogenated models compared to their pristine counterparts. The 3H model has a slightly larger predicted gap (2.06 eV) than 1H (2.01 eV) and 2H (1.86 eV), suggesting that structural ordering might play a role in opening up the electronic band gap in a-P. The computed band gaps for our a-P models agree well with various, previously reported experimental results for amorphous red phosphorus (1.42 to 2.07 eV).[38] Expanding upon prior studies of crystalline allotropes,[5b, 39] we also calculated the electronic DOS, at the hybrid-DFT level, for all crystalline phases discussed in this work (Figure S3) – allowing for side-by-side comparison with our a-P models. A wide range of band gaps was found for the various phosphorus modifications: white P has the largest gap (3.80 eV) among the crystalline allotropes, consistent with its molecular nature, whereas only a small gap exists in black P (0.23 eV), in agreement with experimental data (≈ 0.3 eV).[15, 40] By contrast, violet and fibrous phosphorus have moderate gap sizes (2.26 and 2.30 eV, respectively), close to that of 3H, which shows a relatively more ordered network than the other two hydrogenated models. The band gap sizes of the nanorod structures are in the same range as for other forms of P containing cage-like motifs (viz. 2.01–2.26 eV, Figure S3).

During fitting, data for white phosphorus were not included, since its bond- ing nature, involving P4 molecules, clearly deviates from that of the other crystalline modifica- tions. Bonds longer than 2.7 Å were also ignored, as Pauling’s formula is only expected to describe well the region of relatively strong covalency. We found that the fitted Pauling relation for black, violet, and fibrous phosphorus almost over- laps with the one fitted for P nanorods, suggesting similar bonding in all these crystalline mod- ifications. The same analysis was performed for all P–P bonds in the three pristine a-P models (Figure 4b). The –ICOHP data for a-P scatter in a wide range due to more complex bonding environments; the bonds in the single P4 unit in model 1 are located away from the others, in the same region as found for crystalline white phosphorus. Fitting Pauling’s relation based on the rest of the bonds suggests slightly different bonding in a-P than in the crystalline phases: the bond strength diminishes more quickly with bond length in a-P, perhaps indicating slightly lower chemical stability of the extended network. Energy-resolved –COHP plots provide more detailed “fingerprints” of bonding, as shown in Figure 4c. Despite stable bonds being formed in white phosphorus (within the P4 tetrahedra), evident from stabilising areas below EF (–COHP > 0), the overall bond strength as measured by –ICOHP is lower than in the other forms. By contrast, a small antibonding interaction below EF is observed for black phosphorus (–COHP < 0). Such interactions were reported for P–P bonds in structurally related compounds, viz. (Li-intercalated) phosphorene[43] and BaP4Te2,[44] and in various chalcogenides, such as the iso-valent-electronic GeTe[45] and related Ge–Sb–Te alloys.[46] Hence, antibonding areas below EF do not necessarily suggest poor stability, espe- cially as there are no antibonding interactions directly at EF, and the –ICOHP value is large. Violet and fibrous phosphorus show only bonding areas below EF, and so does n1 (with P8 building units similar to those in the violet and fibrous forms); more complex cage motifs (e.g., P10 and P12) might result in marginal antibonding", "page": 12, "position": 0}

Similar interactions are seen for a-P: there are small antibonding regions not only for the defect states in the gap, but also below the top of valence band. The former is largely attributed to mid-gap defect states; the latter may be due to complex cage motifs (such as in n2 and n3) that are less “ideal” than the P8 / P9 building units in the violet and fibrous forms. Conclusions We have created structural models of amorphous red phosphorus by combining machine-learn- ing-driven molecular dynamics and first-principles computations. Our a-P models are energet- ically intermediate between white phosphorus and the other crystalline modifications. We find that the details of their energetic stability depend on the degree of structural ordering: the less stable amorphous model 1 is rather disordered and resembles a random network, whereas the more stable model 3 is structurally similar to crystalline tubular phases (e.g., violet and fibrous phosphorus). Our work completes the first-principles investigation of the stability range of phosphorus modifications,[21] having added the challenging case of a-P to the picture. We also created models of hydrogenated models a-P, thereby revealing the impact of defect states on the electronic properties of pristine a-P. Our chemical-bonding analyses quantified the relation between bond length and strength, indicating slightly weaker covalent bonding in a-P than in its crystalline counterparts.

The reference database, from which the potential had “learned”, contains configurations of various crystalline, nanostrucured, and liquid phases, and random structures generated via a GAP-driven random structure-searching protocol.[49] The ref- erence data (energies, forces, and stresses) had been computed at the PBE+MBD level. We performed GAP-driven MD simulations in the NPT ensemble, using LAMMPS,[50] with a Nosé–Hoover thermostat[51] controlling the temperature and a barostat[52] controlling the exter- nal pressure. Melt-quench simulations were used to generate small-scale a-P models, starting from three metastable liquid configurations taken from the reference database of the original potential paper.[17] These models each contain 248 atoms with mass densities of 2.5, 2.5, and 2.4 g cm–3, respectively; their structures represent different stages of the liquid-to-liquid phase transition.[53] Both P molecules and covalently connected networks were observed in the former two models, and the third almost fully resembles the network liquid without any P tetrahedra. The models were rapidly de-compressed from ≈ 1 to 0 GPa and annealed at 1,500 K over 10 ps, and then quenched to 1,200 K at a rate of 1013 K s–1. After that, the structural models were slowly cooled down from 1,200 K to 100 K at a rate of 1011 K s–1, thereby forming amorphous networks (Figure S1a). During quenching, the number of fully three-coordinated atoms steadily increased (Figure S1b). We have previously shown that this process allows the simulation to explore the relevant configurational space, leading to a structural model consistent with previ- ous experimental data (including structure factors at ambient and high pressure; see Ref.

A k-point grid with a largest allowed spacing of 0.1 Å–1 along each reciprocal lattice vector was used for structural relaxation for crystalline modifications, and a spacing of 0.15 Å–1 (i.e., a lower k-point density) was used for the following HSE06 computations of the electronic structure and bonding, to reduce com- putational cost. We verified that changing between both settings did not change the predicted band gap of black phosphorus (0.23 eV) within the quoted accuracy. For the a-P and a-P:H models, all data reported are from Γ-point-only computations. Chemical-bonding. The Local-Orbital Basis Suite Towards Electronic-Structure Reconstruc- tion (LOBSTER) code[59] was used to project the self-consistent wave functions onto an auxil- iary basis of localised, atom-centered orbitals (3s and 3p on each P atom), enabling crystal orbital Hamilton population (COHP) analysis.[60] Visualisation. The structural models in Figure 1a and 3a, as well as the fragments shown in Figure 2a, were visualised using OVITO;[61] the visualisations of local motifs and band-resolved charge density in Figure 3c were created using VESTA.[62]", "page": 15, "position": 0}
