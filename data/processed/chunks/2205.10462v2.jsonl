Using ab initio molecular dynamics simulations, we observe spontaneous O2 loss from the (012) surface of delithiated LiNiO2, singlet oxygen forming in the process. We find that the origin of the instability lies in the pronounced oxidation of O during delithiation, i.e., O plays a central role in Ni-O redox in LiNiO2. For LiNiO2, NiO2, and the prototype rock salt NiO, density- functional theory and dynamical mean-field theory calculations based on maximally localised Wannier functions yield a Ni charge state of ca. +2, with O varying between –2 (NiO), –1.5 (LiNiO2) and –1 (NiO2). Predicted XAS Ni K and O K-edge spectra are in excellent agreement with experimental XAS spectra, confirming the predicted charge states. The calculations also show that a high- voltage O K-edge feature at 531 eV previously assigned to lattice O-redox processes could alternatively arise from O-redox induced water intercalation and O–O dimer formation with lattice O at high states of charge. The O2 surface loss route observed here consists of 2 surface O•– radicals combining to form a peroxide ion, which is oxidised to O2, leaving behind 2 O vacancies and 2 O2– ions: effectively 4 O•– radicals disproportionate to O2 and 2 O2– ions.

Singlet oxygen 1O2 has been captured experimentally7 or deduced from the large amount of electrolyte oxidation products that accompany electrode degradation, which are unlikely caused by reaction with unreactive triplet oxygen.8,9 Neither the reason for singlet formation nor its fate after evolution from the surface are, to date, well understood. At the heart of the O-loss problem is the role that O vs. Ni redox plays in the partially reversible removal and reinsertion of Li. The redox activity of LiNiO2 (LNO) is generally attributed predominantly to Ni, i.e., it is assumed that in the process of charging and discharging the battery, it is mainly Ni that is oxidised and reduced.5,10- 13 Within the formal oxidation state model, Ni is considered to be oxidised from +3 to +4 upon delithiating LNO.5,13 It is clear that this ionic picture does not fully capture the nature of the Ni–O bonds which are known to exhibit covalent character with hybridisation between the Ni d and O p states. The charge states of both species will therefore deviate from their formal oxidation states.10,14 However, the consensus is generally that Ni is not solely oxidised/reduced and that while O is somewhat involved in the Ni–O redox processes, Ni activity remains dominant. In agreement with this,5,10,11 X-ray spectroscopy (XAS) of Ni-rich layered oxides shows a shift of the Ni K edge on delithiation towards higher energies,15-17 which is commonly interpreted as experimental confirmation of the changes in the Ni charge state. Kong et al. have previously reported partial O oxidation upon delithiation of LNO but continue to attribute the main redox activity to Ni.10 In a similar vein, Korotin et al.18 and Foyevtsova et al.19 invoke ligand holes on oxygen, suggesting a partial charge transfer of oxygen to", "page": 1, "position": 0}

The charge states in the LNO system have not previously been investigated in depth, especially as there are numerous technical challenges regarding the quantification of species in hybridised states.

They report a rise in 1O2 evolution around 500 K,7 confirming the existence of at least one route for 1O2 formation without any electrolyte. Houchins et al. have recently proposed that in metal-air batteries, singlet oxygen forms via a disproportionation reaction of superoxide radicals in solution.30 As the superoxide radicals are part of the metal-air electrochemistry and they play no role in Li-ion batteries, it is unlikely or at least unclear if the formation of singlet oxygen in Li-ion batteries with layered oxide cathode materials follows the same mechanism. Understanding how oxygen is evolved requires an atomistic examination of the surfaces involved. Based on scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction, Zhu and Chen31 and Garcia and co-workers32 showed the prevalent surfaces in Ni-rich layered oxide cathodes to exhibit facets of the (012), (001), and (104) families, in line with computational predictions.33-35 The facets found to cover the greatest surface area, over a range of particle morphologies, were (012) facets,31 which are predicted to be O-terminated at synthesis conditions.33 The O-terminated (012) facet is therefore an ideal model system to explore (singlet) oxygen loss in Ni-rich layered oxides.

We propose a comprehensive mechanism for the observed route of oxygen loss and singlet oxygen formation, pivotal for mitigating electrolyte oxidation pathways associated with singlet oxygen release.37 2 Oxidation states Even at the most basic level of charge analysis, a Bader partition of DFT densities from PBE+U calculations (Ueff = 6 eV, as proposed by Das et al.5 and validated with hybrid functionals and dynamical mean-field theory in this study) shows that Ni exhibits a similar charge state in materials that show three different formal Ni oxidation states, NiO, LiNiO2 and NiO2 (see Fig. 1 a, first blue bar in each set). By contrast, Fig. 1 a shows that the O charge state, on the other hand, changes significantly upon delithiation of LiNiO2, and even further upon formation of NiO. The electronic density of states (DOS) (see Fig. 1 b) suggests ferromagnetic behaviour at 0 K. Of particular interest are the states just below the Fermi energy, as these are the states that electrons are removed from upon delithiation of the material. The character of these states can be estimated by projecting the DOS onto spherical harmonics, i.e., local atomic orbitals. They indicate that the states just below the Fermi energy have predominantly O (red) contributions and only to a small extent Ni (blue) contributions. The charge density of these states (yellow isosurface in Fig.1 c) confirms pronounced O p contributions and weaker Ni eg contributions just below the Fermi energy (the states are highlighted in the DOS in Fig. 1 b). Due to the hybridised nature of the states near the Fermi energy and the challenges in separating the charges, the charges were also analysed at a more advanced level with a wannierisation of the PBE Kohn-Sham orbitals. In the case of LNO, a Ni d wannierisation shows large O p contributions for the nominal Ni eg* states or highest occupied states (orbitals shown in yellow and green in Fig. 1 c), confirming that the Ni and O bands are strongly hybridised.

If the O states are explicitly included in the wannierisation using a d-p model, Ni d states are localised on Ni centres and O p states on O centres (see Fig. 1 c).

Dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) calculations were therefore performed to address this, which account for electron correlations via a mean-field approach and obtain charge states by integrating over the impurity Green’s functions in a Wannier basis. The DMFT spectral function is shown in Fig. 1 d for the ferromagnetic case, resembling the DFT DOS at 0 K. At temperatures above the Curie temperature, the material becomes paramagnetic, as shown in Fig. 1 e, where the two eg states are each half occupied (red line). This small band-gap paramagnetic behaviour is in good agreement with experimental findings at battery operating temperatures.39-43 Returning to the question of the charge states of Ni and O, Fig. 1 a shows that the DMFT charges (third bar of each set) are nearly identical to the Wannier charges based on the PBE densities (middle bar of each set). DMFT yields a Ni oxidation state of ∼ +2 in all three materials, LiNiO2, NiO2, and NiO, while the charge of O is ca. −1.5 in LiNiO2, −1 in NiO2, and assumes its most stable state of −2 only in the decomposition product NiO. A standard experimental procedure to track oxidation state changes in battery materials is X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS). To validate the computed charge states and directly compare our predictions with experiment, we calculated Ni K and O K spectra for LNO and NiO2 (see Fig. 2 a+b) and compared them with experimental Ni K and O K X-ray spectra of a 2% W-doped LNO cathode at varying states of delithiation (see Fig. 2 c+d).17 The spectra were collected in the bulk-sensitive", "page": 5, "position": 0}

The magnitude of the shift is in excellent agreement with the edge shift observed in experiment (see Fig. 2c). While our DFT calculations find the Ni charge to remain +2, they predict that the local Ni-O bonding environment changes on delithiation (see Fig. 2e). In line with previous computations5,44 and EXAFS results45 we find LNO to be Jahn-Teller distorted at zero Kelvin.

The O K edge spectrum shows overall greater changes on delithiation than the Ni K spectrum, both computationally (see Fig. 2b) and experimentally (see Fig. 2d). Theory and experiment are again in good agreement regarding the evolution of features, showing a pronounced increase of the O pre-edge peak– a measure of the covalency of the Ni–O bond and the hole concentration of these states– as well as an overall shift of the spectrum to higher energies. An exception is a small additional feature emerging around 531 eV in the experimental O K spectrum at high state of charge that is not seen in the calculated spectrum of defect-free NiO2. This could stem, for example, from additional species such as point defects or additional electronic phenomena beyond the DFT level of the O K spectra calculations.

The question arises if water could be causing the additional XAS feature. This requires water to generally be available in the system.

Some of the dimers and the nearby lattice O are protonated, with dynamic proton exchange occurring. N.B., the dimers do not leave the lattice sites in the course of our simulations. A systematic investigation of the process and a potential involvement of electronic quasi-particles (see SI) is underway but it is worth noting at this stage, first, that such dimers yield XAS signals matching the additional high- voltage feature seen experimentally (see Fig. 2b+d) and, second, that an XAS spectrum calculated for the hydrated material shows excellent overall agreement with the experimental spectrum at 4.7 V. 3 Surface oxygen loss As LNO is known to decompose through surface reactions, it is pivotal to understand how the bulk oxidation states discussed above compare to oxidation states at the surface.

AIMD simulations of the (012) NiO2 surface show a spontaneous loss of O2 molecules and even the formation of singlet oxygen in the process (see Fig. 3 b) at simulated temperatures from 300 – 800 K. Fig. 3 b shows the free energy profile of an exemplary PBE+U trajectory at ca. 450 K, suggesting the reaction releasing one O2 molecule liberates 3.0 eV. This was confirmed with AIMD simulations including dispersion interactions and based on hybrid functionals, which also show spontaneous O2 loss to release ca. 3 eV. As seen in Fig. 3 b, the reaction appears barrierless, suggesting that the activation barrier is smaller than the energy fluctuations due to thermal vibrations (<0.05 eV).

Albeit briefly, this points towards singlet character of the electronic ground state, and this is the ground state of the peroxide ion. Through constraining the number of unpaired electrons in the simulation cell, we can also enforce the singlet state before the transition, and we see it become degenerate with the AIMD ground state (nearly degenerate ca. 15 fs before the drop in the magnetic moments, and fully degenerate ca. 3 fs before the drop, see the green data points in Fig. 3 d+f). This singlet state forms as the 2 oxide radicals forming the peroxide come close enough together to start interacting with each other but before any oxidation takes place. The magnetisation density of the singlet state is illustrated in Fig. 3 e+f.

Through constraining the number of unpaired electrons, the singlet state is also obtained for 1O2 after it has left the surface. The magnetisation density seen in Fig. 3 f looks very similar to the singlet seen during the peroxide formation, but in the 1O2 molecule, the planes of the lobes are fully aligned, suggesting a stronger interaction (at a smaller distance; earlier 1.4 Å between the interacting radicals vs. 1.2 Å in the molecule). Fig. 3 d shows that the gas phase singlet is no longer degenerate with the ground state but an excited state. In a DFT gas phase calculation, 1O2 can also be obtained by constraining the magnetic moments of each O atom to zero. The gas phase 1O2 shows the same magnetisation density as the gas phase 1O2 at the surface of NiO2 (see SI). The highest energy level is degenerate across the two spin channels and occupied by one spin-up and spin- down electron each, indicating that this type of singlet seen both in the gas phase and evolving from the NiO2 surface in our simulations corresponds to the 1∆ singlet where the spins are paired, giving the singlet a closed-shell character.50,51 5 Discussion Our results suggest that the redox processes in LiNiO2 need to be reconsidered.

All calculations consistently suggest that what is commonly considered to be Ni-redox chemistry predominantly affects the charge state of O (see Figs. 1 a and 4 a). Even though both Ni and O are involved in the redox process, the amount of charge density at the Ni site barely changes on delithiation. If this effect occurred only in a Bader charge analysis, it might be considered an artefact from the choice of Bader cut-offs, not trivial for hybridised states. The DMFT calculations based on a Wannier d-p model, however, can separate the d and p contributions and they confirm the constant charge state of Ni2+ and the changing charge state of O from –1.5 in LiNiO2 to –1 in NiO2 (and –2 in NiO). This raises the question of why the charge density changes so much more at the O site than at the Ni site. Examining the Wannier on-site energies allows for an estimation of the energy levels of the localised states. The on-site energies (see Fig. 4 b) show a clear separation between the Ni d and O p states (Mott-type behaviour) only for the prototype rock salt NiO. In LiNiO2, the difference between the O p states and Ni d states is < 1eV, promoting hybridisation (as directly seen in", "page": 11, "position": 1}

The standard understanding considers Ni to undergo the greatest changes in oxidation state when a battery is cycled, from +3 in LiNiO2 to +4 in NiO2 and +2 in the prototype rock salt NiO during degradation. O is commonly considered to be less affected, mostly assuming a charge state of -2. All our DFT and DMFT simulations instead suggest that O undergoes the greatest changes in charge state, from -1.5 in LiNiO2 to -1 in NiO2 and -2 in NiO. Ni is less affected and mostly assumes a charge state of +2. b, Wannier on-site energies for NiO, LiNiO2, and NiO2 are a measure of the energies of the localised states. The energies show a small gap ∆ between the Ni d and O p states in LNO, promoting Ni−O hybridisation and charge-transfer behaviour. The gap decreases upon delithiation; in NiO2, the Ni d and O p states are degenerate. This causes strong splitting of the levels of the hybridised states, presumably pushing O states close to the Fermi level. This charge-transfer behaviour and O-redox activity directly compromise the material’s stability and promote O2 loss. c, the following mechanism is derived for the route of spontaneous O2 loss observed in AIMD simulations: (i) 2 oxide radicals O•- combine to form a peroxide ion O22-; (ii) the peroxide is oxidised to an O2 molecule, desorbs, and", "page": 12, "position": 0}

The charge- transfer nature of LNO is also predicted according to the criterion proposed by Zaanen, Sawatzsky, and Allen,24,25,52 for 3d transition metal compounds, namely that the split between d and p states (∆ = 2 eV for LNO) is small compared to the d–d split (the Coulomb repulsion U = 6 eV). Korotkin et al.18 and Foyevtsova et al.19 also speak of ligand holes on oxygen in LNO, discussing the possibility of charge-transfer behaviour of LNO. Comparing our theoretical XAS Ni K and O K-edge spectra to experimental XAS data (see Fig. 2), we see excellent agreement for calculations yielding a constant Ni charge of +2 and varying O charge of –1.5 in LNO and –1 in NiO. Both the observed features and their evolution on delithiation agree very well with experiment, confirming the charge states proposed here. The question then arises why XAS spectra of Ni-rich layered oxides with comparable edge shifts15,16 have previously been considered evidence of Ni3+ changing to Ni4+. This calls for a brief methodological reflection on the interpretation of XAS. XAS is a powerful method for probing local structural environments, both in terms of charge states and bonding geometries. There is, however, to date no way to deconvolute effects from the two, i.e., changes in the XAS edges could arise from changes in the charge state and/or changes in bond lengths, angles etc. Most studies to date interpret the shift of the Ni K edge as evidence of the Ni oxidation state changing.15 The local coordination environment, however, also changes substantially upon delithiation (see Fig. 2e), mainly in two regards. First, the Jahn- Teller distortions are lifted and, second, leaving aside changes in the symmetry of the bonding environment, the average Ni–O bond lengths also change on delithiation, decreasing from 2.0 Å in LNO to 1.9 Å in NiO2.

Furthermore, due to the strong Ni-O hybridisation, the Ni K edge is also expected to be altered by changes in the O charge state. The stronger shifts in the O K edge, seen both computationally (Fig. 2b) and experimentally (Fig. 2d) illustrate that the greatest changes in electronic structure occur on O, where in addition to the changing bond lengths the charge state also changes substantially. Tracing the Ni-edge shift back to changing Ni charge states is therefore by no means a clear-cut deduction; the excellent agreement of the experimental Ni K and O K spectra and our spectra calculated at a constant Ni charge state of +2 on the contrary suggests that it is time to revisit the established interpretation; an assignment of the shift to the changing bond lengths and oxygen charge states is consistent with all our computational and reported experimental data.", "page": 13, "position": 1}

The effect is so pronounced that the redox behaviour of LNO can be described very well with an ionic model after all, but with one phrased in terms of changes of the charge state of O. N.B., we expect O to be strongly involved in many other oxides’ redox chemistries, too, but for scenarios where both O and the transition metal undergo significant changes in charge states (e.g. in Li-excess materials) it may not be helpful to apply an ionic picture focusing only on one kind of redox-active species. Identifying the central role of O redox in LNO does not open routes to enhanced capacities as the overall capacity of the hybridised Ni–O system remains constant – and is also limited by the total content of lithium in the material, but it has central ramifications for the material’s stability at high states of charge. If bulk Ni–O redox in LNO affects primarily the charge states of oxygen and O is oxidised on battery charging, it is not surprising that the material is unstable towards oxygen loss at high states of charge; and similar behaviour is expected for Ni-rich layered oxide cathodes in general (with the effects increasing with increasing Ni content). The water-assisted bulk O–O-dimer formation mechanism proposed in Section 2 as a possible origin of the 531 eV peak in the O K-edge XAS spectrum at high states of charge can also be rationalised in terms of the pronounced O redox behaviour of LNO. A charge analysis indicates that the dimer itself is oxidised, reducing the nearby lattice O from –1 to ca. –1.5, thus counteracting the oxidation of bulk O. An in-depth study will follow shortly. The dimers cause XAS signal intensity around 531 eV, where features are conventionally assigned to O-redox processes53 (and they exhibit an O–O distance of ca. 1.2 Å, consistent with the vibronic features seen with Resonant Inelastic X-ray Scattering, RIXS17,53).

As the dimer formation occurs because of O redox, the 531 eV XAS feature can technically be considered an O-redox signature. Given that O redox in our eyes governs the evolution of the whole spectrum on delithiation, there is, however, little benefit in highlighting specifically the 531 eV signal as an O-redox feature, as the changes in edge energies and intensities are all a result of the oxidation of the lattice O on delithiation. We leave for a future study to clarify further why the 531 eV peak emerges at high voltages: specifically whether it requires either a critical extent of O oxidation, of electrolyte decomposition generating water, or of free space for the water molecule to enter the Li layer – or most likely a combination of these factors. Our findings further open up a bigger discussion regarding the O-redox feature reported for various materials at high states of charge, ranging from the NMCs to Li-excess materials.53 Given that these materials differ substantially in many regards but are all oxides, the question arises if the XAS peak often assigned to O redox in some of these materials can be traced back to water reacting with oxidised lattice O to form O–O dimers.

Methodologically, we find PBE+U calculations with Ueff = 6 eV surprisingly well suited for describing the 0 K electronic structure – particularly with respect to the charge states of LNO, NiO2, and NiO (see Fig. 1 a). DMFT calculations based on a Wannier d–p model not only validate the trends seen with a PBE+U Bader charge analysis, and suggest they remain valid at finite temperatures, but also show excellent quantitative agreement with PBE Wannier charges. The wannierisation route for determining charges in hybridised states28,29 in our case obtained DMFT-quality oxidation states from PBE when the basis of the Wannier model was chosen carefully (d–p for LiNiO2 and NiO2; d for NiO). It promises to be a powerful tool for quantifying charge states in battery materials more generally. Based on our AIMD simulations of spontaneous O2 loss from the (012) facet in NiO2 (see Fig. 3), we propose the following mechanism for the observed reaction route: (i) 2 oxide radicals O•– combine to form a peroxide ion O22– (see Fig. 4 c); (ii) upon peroxide formation and desorption, the 2 O•– are oxidised to molecular O2, leaving behind 2 oxygen vacancies and 2 electrons; (iii) the 2 electrons reduce the 2 closest O•– radicals to O2– ions. (ii) and (iii) occur simultaneously. In sum, the reaction mechanism thus consists of 4 O•– radicals disproportionating to form molecular O2, 2 O2– ions, and 2 oxygen vacancies. Whereas in metal-air batteries, the superoxide radical O2•– disproportionates,30 the reaction route we observe in LNO involves the disproportionation of the oxide radical O•–, i.e., while there are parallels between the reaction mechanisms, the disproportionating species differ according to the different battery redox chemistries. The oxide O•– disproportionation is likely to be representative of Li-ion batteries with Ni-rich layered oxide cathodes.

We here identify the origin of the instability of NiO2 (and the related phenomena) to lie in the significant covalency of LiNiO2 resulting in an apparent high oxidation state of O (–1) in NiO2. A further point is the question of whether densified surface phases prohibit the further release of oxygen. While the rock-salt phases most likely passivate the surfaces, either prohibiting or slowing down further oxygen loss, polycrystalline Ni-rich oxides are known to suffer from particle cracking54 which continues to expose fresh surfaces: until particle cracking can be successfully prevented, the materials are expected to continue releasing oxygen via the reported and related reaction pathways.55-57", "page": 15, "position": 1}

As the peroxide is oxidised to molecular oxygen, spin conservation rules favour the release of 1O2. Given the strongly exergonic nature of the reaction (see Fig. 3 b) liberating 3 eV, 1O2 is easily released in its excited state. Singlet oxygen formation in layered oxide cathodes thus follows in the footsteps of the wealth of reports of singlet oxygen formation from (mostly organic) peroxide reactions. The final question concerns the fate of 1O2 after its evolution. Does it remain in the singlet state (accounting for 1O2 found experimentally7), react with electrolyte components (explaining the vast amounts of electrolyte oxidation products found), or deactivate into its triplet ground state? Both during the reaction and shortly after, the peroxide/O2 molecule strongly interacts with the spins at the surface. Surface interactions, for example, enable the combination of the two O2•– radicals, each with positive spin density, to the singlet peroxide in the first place – a process that would be spin-forbidden for isolated radicals. Interactions of the newly formed singlet 1O2 molecule with the surface will also provide routes of the otherwise spin-forbidden relaxation into triplet 3O2. We leave these processes for future study, ideally to be addressed with dedicated multi-reference tools that can fully account for the open- shell character of the isolated O2 molecule and excited states beyond the DFT ground state. Our work, however, shows that a low activation energy route towards singlet oxygen release occurs via the ground state singlet state of the peroxide. 6 Conclusion Through a rigorous charge analysis based on DFT and DMFT calculations, we have shown that the delithiation of LiNiO2 to NiO2 predominantly occurs via the oxidation of O and only causes minor changes in the charge of Ni.

Calculation of d and p occupancies using DMFTproj in this energy range yields significantly different occupancies from the expected formal oxidation states for each element which is adjusted only slightly by DMFT calculations on the d manifold with projections for O p calculated and made part of the bath.
