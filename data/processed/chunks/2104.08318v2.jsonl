Here, we use LixCoO2 (LCO) as a model system to benchmark a scale-bridging framework that combines density functional theory (DFT) calculations at the atomistic scale with phase ﬁeld modeling at the continuum scale to understand the impact of phase stability on microstructure evolution. This scale bridging is accomplished by incorporating traditional statistical mechanics methods with integrable deep neural networks, which allows formation energies for speciﬁc atomic conﬁgurations to be coarse-grained and incorporated in a neural network description of the free energy of the material. The resulting realistic free energy functions enable atomistically informed phase-ﬁeld simulations. These computational results allow us to make connections to experimental work on LCO cathode degradation as a function of temperature, morphology and particle size. 1. Introduction Layered oxides of type LixTM O2 (TM=Ni, Co, Mn) are commonly used cathodes in Li-ion batteries. Key to their versatility is the ability to tune the chemistry speciﬁc to an application. While LiCoO2 (LCO) has traditionally been the cathode of choice for consumer electronics, Ni-rich compositions are attractive candidates for high energy density batteries, which are increasingly in demand with electriﬁcation of trans- portation. However, the cycling performance of Ni-rich NMC cathodes is known to suﬀer from surface phase transitions [1, 2], mechanical failures [3, 4], and undesired degradation reactions with electrolytes [5, 6].

However, the cycling performance of Ni-rich NMC cathodes is known to suﬀer from surface phase transitions [1, 2], mechanical failures [3, 4], and undesired degradation reactions with electrolytes [5, 6]. A common strategy to improve the cycling and structural stability of layered oxides is extrinsic doping with trace amounts of foreign elements [7, 8, 9]. Understanding the defect-thermodynamics of dopants and how that impacts the crystal structure stability and long-term electrochemical properties of NMCs from ﬁrst principles requires a modeling framework that span lengthscales ranging from the atomistic to the con- tinuum. However, scale-bridging is inherently a hard problem to address and prior studies, as we outline below, have looked at the diﬀerent length-scales in isolation. Here, we benchmark a recently published scale- bridging framework [10, 11] against LixCoO2 (LCO), a well-characterized model cathode, by computing its thermodynamic phase behavior and microstructure evolution under Li intercalation. The rich phase-behavior of LCO has been extensively studied by experiments. A ﬁrst order phase transition has been identiﬁed for compositions 0.75 ≤x ≤0.94, caused by a metal-insulator transition [12, 13]. Reimers and Dahn [12] reported on an ordering that appears at x = 0.5, conﬁrmed to be a row ordering [14, 15]. Shao-Horn et al. [14] found evidence of ordering at x = 0.33 at low temperatures (∼100 ∗Corresponding Author Preprint submitted to April 26, 2021 arXiv:2104.08318v2 [cond-mat.mtrl-sci] 22 Apr 2021", "page": 0, "position": 1}

Additionally, charge ordering Co3+ and Co4+ atoms at compositions of x = 0.5 and x = 0.67 was observed at a temperature of 175 K, while Co3+ and Co4+ occupation was random at room temperature [16, 15]. Multiple studies have also identiﬁed a transition from the O3 host structure to the H1-3 structure at compositions below x = 0.33 [17, 18]. Alongside the experimental work have been the numerous computational studies that have also explored LCO. Ab initio thermodynamic approaches combining density functional theory (DFT) calculations and statistical mechanics [19, 20] have been used to systematically predict phase diagrams, free energy data, and voltage curves. The ﬁrst-principles methods also have been combined with experimental results and CALPHAD models to deﬁne functions for the Gibbs energy [21, 18]. However, quantities computed from the atomistic and lattice models have not informed the more coarse-grained methods, such as phase ﬁeld models to study the thermodynamics and kinetics of phase transitions in these systems. Recently, a continuum level phase ﬁeld approach has combined free energy and misﬁt strain information from experiments with the predicted diﬀusivity from ﬁrst-principles calculations to model the metal-insulator phase transition that has been seen experimentally [22]. In eﬀect, while the link between ab initio and statistical mechanics computa- tions is well established, there remains an absence, so far, of comprehensive scale bridging frameworks. The current work seeks to demonstrate a systematic framework combining some of the computational approaches described above with advances in machine learning to bridge electronic structure calculations, statistical mechanics approaches and continuum scale simulations, Figure 1. Our use of O3 layered LCO to benchmark the approach is motivated by the observation that, to the best of our knowledge, this path to scale bridging has not been presented for this cathode material. We perform DFT+U calculations using the well-known Hubbard correction [23] to capture electronic correlation in transition metal oxides with localized d orbitals.

A cluster expansion Hamiltonian is parameterized by the DFT and used in Monte Carlo sampling to compute the point defect thermodynamics as a function of temperature and chemical potential, and to construct temperature - composition phase diagrams [25, 26]. For bridging statistical mechanics and continuum representations of the free energy density function (and its derivatives), we turn to integrable deep neural networks (IDNNs) introduced previously [10, 11]. IDNNs can be trained to derivative data, e.g. chemical potential data generated through Monte Carlo sampling, and analytically integrated to recover the antiderivative function, e.g. the free energy function needed in phase ﬁeld models. The chemical potentials and free energies thus obtained are used to conﬁrm a match with extensively reported phase diagrams for LCO, as well as voltage curves over the composition range of [0.33, 1]. Finally, using the obtained free energies, we carry out phase ﬁeld studies that take a step beyond the construction of equilibrium phase diagrams by accessing dynamics of phase formations and particle morphologies. Speciﬁcally, we study spinodal decomposition as well as charge-discharge cycles on single LCO particles at temperatures of practical interest, and for diﬀerent particle sizes. These computational results allow us to make connections to experimental work on LCO cathode degradation as a function of temperature, morphology and particle size. By this, they allow us to address experimental and technologically relevant scenarios. They also serve as a culminating demonstration of predictive computations enabled by our scale bridging framework. The paper is laid out as follows: Section 2 sets forth the methods used in the paper consisting of the DFT calculations, statistical mechanics sampling, IDNN setup and training, and the phase ﬁeld equations. Section 3 describes and discusses the results of each step of the framework while making comparisons with experimental observations. Discussion", "page": 1, "position": 1}

Density functional theory methods The formation energy E of a conﬁguration with Li composition x can be calculated using total energy values computed using density functional theory (DFT) according to the following equation [19]: E = Etot −xEtot LiCoO2 −(1 −x)Etot CoO2 (1) where Etot, Etot LiCoO2, and Etot CoO2 are the total energies for the given conﬁguration, LiCoO2, and CoO2, respectively. In performing DFT calculations for LixCoO2, Aykol and co-authors found that it is important to include not only the Hubbard correction (DFT+U), which reduces self-interaction errors [27, 28, 29]), but to also include the van der Waals (vdW) interactions [24]. The eﬀect of the vdW interactions allows the voltage predicted by DFT to match the experimental voltage when using an appropriately tuned value of U. While both vdW-corrections and vdW-density functionals (vdW-DF) improve the DFT results, predictions are most consistent and accurate with vdW-DF. In this workﬂow, we use a simpliﬁed rotational-invariant formulation of DFT+U [23] and a vdW-DF exchange correlation functional, namely the optB88 exchange correlation functional [30, 31, 32, 33, 24, 34, 35], to calculate the formation energy on a chosen subset of LCO conﬁgurations. We perform the ground-state DFT calculations with geometry optimization in Quantum Espresso [36, 37], using projector augmented-wave (PAW) pseudopotentials calculated with the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) functional from PSlibrary 1.0.0 [38, 39]. The values for the wave function and charge density cutoﬀs are chosen in two steps. Starting with the cutoﬀvalues suggested in the pseudopotential ﬁle for Co, we ﬁrst increase only the charge density cutoﬀuntil the total energy converges to <1 meV/atom. Next, we increase both the wave function and the charge density cutoﬀs, maintaining the ratio of the two values, until the total energy again converges to <1 meV/atom, giving a wave function cutoﬀof 55 Ha and a charge density cutoﬀof 301.5 Ha.

We compute the average voltage over the following ranges of Li composition: x ∈[0, 1], x ∈[0, 1/2], and x ∈[1/2, 1]. By comparing with experimental voltages (Figure 3), we select an appropriate value of U. 2.2. Statistical mechanics In this work, we follow the statistical mechanics approach outlined by Van der Ven, et al. [19] in their ﬁrst-principles study of LixCoO2 (LCO), and of Natarajan, et al. [43], among others. 2.2.1. Cluster expansion for formation energy Given the expense of DFT calculations, we adopt cluster expansions to access the large numbers of conﬁgurations needed in the statistical mechanics studies. The formation energy is written as E(σ), where σ is the conﬁguration vector with the occupancy variable σi = 1 if Li occupies the site i and σi = 0 if the site contains a vacancy. As is common, we deﬁne E(σ) by computing the formation energy with DFT for a subset of conﬁgurations and use these values to parameterize a cluster expansion [44, 45] as a rapidly queryable surrogate for the formation energy. We use the CASM software[46], which facilitates the construction 4", "page": 3, "position": 0}

Candidate conﬁgurations are chosen for O3-LixCoO2 with Li compositions from x = 0 to x = 1. A cluster is a collection of potential Li sites. Given cluster α of sites α = {i, j, . . . , k}, a polynomial φα can be deﬁned as the product of occupancy variables of those sites, i.e. φα = σiσj · · · σk. A cluster expansion is a linear combination of the polynomials φα, leading to the following form for the formation energy: E(σ) = V0 + X α Vαφα(σ), (3) where the coeﬃcients V0 and Vα are optimized for a “best ﬁt”, and are called eﬀective cluster interactions (ECI). We ﬁt a cluster expansion to the formation energy calculated using DFT for 333 conﬁgurations for the O3 host structure using the CASM code. A sparse regression technique that combines a genetic algorithm with weighted linear regression is used to perform the ﬁt. In this approach, a number of candidate basis functions are created using pairs, triplets, etc. of lattice sites that are within a given distance. The genetic algorithm is used to select a subset of these basis functions to include in the cluster expansion. The coeﬃcients of each subset of basis functions are calculated using linear regression. We use cluster types up to quadruplets, with maximum lattice site distances shown in Table 1, for a total of 221 candidate basis functions.

Monte Carlo sampling Given E(σ), we sample within the semi-grand canonical ensemble, in which the chemical potential is speciﬁed and the corresponding composition and/or order parameters are determined through ensemble averaging. The partition function for the semi-grand canonical ensemble is the following: Θ = X σ exp \u0012 −E(σ) −M [x(σ)µ0 + η(σ) · µ] kBT \u0013 (4) where η represents the vector of order parameters explained below, µ0 is the chemical potential associated with composition, µ is the vector of chemical potentials associated with the order parameters, M is the number of reference supercells that tile the conﬁguration, kB is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the temperature. Each chemical potential is the derivative of the free energy with respect to its corresponding composition or order parameter. The chemical potential associated with Li composition is related to the voltage as a function of compo- sition, V (x) as V (x) = −µcathode Li (x) −µanode Li e , (5) where µcathode Li is the chemical potential with respect to Li for the cathode (LCO) and µanode Li is the chemical potential of the anode. Taking the anode to be Li metal, µanode Li is a constant equal to the Gibbs free energy of Li [42]. It is necessary for the two chemical potentials to have a consistent reference, however. 5", "page": 4, "position": 1}

(1). Since the chemical potential is the derivative of the free energy with respect to composition, this re-referencing shifted the chemical potential of LCO by a constant k equal to the derivative of Eq. (1) with respect to x, i.e. k := −Etot LiCoO2 + Etot CoO2. Therefore, we reverse the shift in the chemical potential by subtracting k from µcathode Li (x) before computing the voltage according to Eq. (5). This imposes a consistent reference for both µcathode Li and µanode Li . A limitation with Monte Carlo sampling within the semi-grand canonical ensemble is that it does not produce data within the unstable regions associated with phase separation. While this is suﬃcient for producing phase diagrams and predicting voltage, phase ﬁeld simulations require free energy information within these two-phase regions in order to consistently resolve phase interfaces. For this reason, we also employ umbrella sampling methods, in which bias potentials are applied to sample within the unstable regions that would otherwise be missed [43, 50, 51, 52]. The partition function used in this case, then, is the following: Θ = X σ exp −E(σ) + M \u0002 φ0(x(σ) −κ0)2 + Pn i=1 φi(ηi(σ) −κi)2\u0003 kBT !

Symmetry-adapted order parameters In addition to composition, symmetry-adapted order parameters are useful for observing and tracking order-disorder transitions, as well as for identifying the various translational and rotational variants of a given ordering. The method for identifying symmetry-adapted order parameters is laid out elsewhere; e.g., see Natarajan, et al. [43]. In this process, a supercell capable of representing all variants of the ordering is found, called a mutually commensurate supercell. The sublattice compositions of this supercell form a basis that can describe each variant as a vector x, where each component is 1 if the corresponding sublattice sites are fully occupied by Li and 0 otherwise. A matrix Q that transforms the sublattice compositions x to a vector of order parameters η is constructed following an algorithm described by Thomas and Van der Ven [53]. The algorithm involves enumerating the group P of matrices that transform between all variants of the given ordering. A matrix is formed, deﬁned by its invariance to all transformation matrices in P. The eigenvalue decomposition of this P-invariant matrix is used to construct Q. While Thomas and Van der Ven deal with a general system, in simpler cases each nonzero eigenvalue is associated with either the average composition or the set of variants for a particular ordering. The eigenvectors form the rows of the matrix Q, deﬁning the transformation from sublattice compositions to order parameters. In some cases, Q maps to more order parameters than are necessary to describe a single ordering. When that occurs, a subset of rows can be extracted from Q to create a reduced set of relevant order parameters. This algorithmic process is easily understood via an example, which is described in section 3.2.3. 2.3. Integrable deep neural networks for free energy representations The", "page": 5, "position": 1}

The integrability of the IDNN is built into its structure by constructing it as the derivative form of a standard fully-connected deep neural network (DNN). While it is straightforward to diﬀerentiate the equations describing the standard DNN to derive the equations for the IDNN, modern deep learning libraries make this step unnecessary. The user can simply construct a standard DNN and apply a gradient operation to create the IDNN, which is then used for training. Mathematically, a DNN can be denoted by a function Y (X, W , b) representing the chemical potentials ⟨µi⟩, with arguments or inputs X representing the composition ⟨x⟩, order parameters ⟨ηi⟩, weights W , and biases b. Training the DNN involves an optimization problem for the weights and biases, given the dataset {(c Xθ, bYθk)}: c W ,bb = arg min W ,b MSE \u0012 Y (X, W , b) b Xθ , bYθ \u0013 (9) The case of interest here is when the dataset {(c Xθ, bYθk)} is not available. Instead, we have the derivative dataset {(c Xθ, byθk)}, where byθk corresponds to the k-th partial derivative of bYθ. To use these data, the IDNN is deﬁned as the gradient of Y with respect to its inputs X, i.e. ∂Y (X, W , b)/∂Xk. The training is deﬁned as follows: c W ,bb = arg min W ,b n X k=1 MSE \u0012∂Y (X, W , b) ∂Xk b Xθ , byθk \u0013 (10) The resulting optimized weights c W and biases bb can be used with the function ∂Y (X, c W ,bb)/∂Xk to return a prediction of the chemical potential. Its antiderivative is exactly represented by using the same weights and biases in the function Y (X, c W ,bb). For the current work, ∂Y (X, c W ,bb)/∂Xk gives the IDNN representation of the chemical potentials, and Y (X, c W ,bb) is the DNN representation of the free energy.

The IDNNs for 260 K, 300 K, and 340 K are constructed with 100, 60, and 20 neurons per layer, respectively, arrived at by hyperparameter optimization, due to diﬀering complexity in the data at diﬀerent temperatures. The hyberbolic tangent is used as the activation function, since we found it to better capture the small ﬂuctuations in chemical potential around x = 0.5 than the softplus function used by us in previous work [10, 11]. The IDNNs are trained for 50,000 epochs using the RMSprop optimizer and a batch size of 20. An initial learning rate of 0.002 is used, with periodic reductions in the learning rate applied during training.

Phase ﬁeld theory and associated computational framework The evolution of microstructure and phase changes can be modeled using the phase ﬁeld equations. The Cahn-Hilliard equation [54] models the dynamics of conserved quantities, such as composition, while nonconserved order parameter ﬁelds are modeled using the Allen-Cahn equation [55]. When neglecting elastic eﬀects, the total free energy of the system with n order parameters can be described as follows: Π[x, η] = Z Ω f(x, η) + 1 2χ0|∇x|2 + n X i=1 1 2χi|∇ηi|2 ! dV (11) where χi are the gradient parameters, and f(x, η) is the free energy density, to be represented by an analytically integrated DNN in this work. 7", "page": 6, "position": 1}

Since the free energy for these initial simulations is a function of Li composition only, i.e., a conserved order parameter, the Cahn-Hilliard equation from Eq. (14) is suﬃcient to model the system. The non-conservative Allen-Cahn equation in Eq. (15) is not relevant without inclusion of the non-conserved order parameters, which are obtained from rows 2-7 of the bQ matrix presented in Section 3.2.3. The simulations are performed using the ﬁnite element method with the mechanoChemFEM code1, which is based on the deal.II [58] library, and run on the ConFlux HPC cluster at the University of Michigan. Adaptive meshing with hanging nodes and adaptive time stepping are used. 3. Results 3.1. Formation energies and conﬁgurations from density functional theory The predicted average voltage for Li composition ranges [0,1], [0,0.5], and [0.5,1] and increasing values of U are plotted in Figure 3. By comparing with experimental voltages from Ref. [24], we selected a value of U = 2.5 eV to use in the calculation of formation energies for LCO. This provides a good match with the experimental voltage for x ∈[0, 1] and x ∈[0.5, 1], with a small error of 0.03 eV for x ∈[0, 0.5].

Using the tuned value for U, fully-relaxed DFT calculations were completed for 333 of these conﬁgurations, with CASM automatically adjusting the size of the k-points grid according to atomic conﬁguration.

[14] suggest conﬁguration B might be possible. Charge ordering of Co3+ and Co4+ atoms has been experimentally observed at low temperatures and Li compositions of x = 1/2 and x = 2/3 [16]. The development of charge ordering can be monitored through the magnetic moments in the DFT calculations [24]. Interestingly, evidence of charge splitting appears in the DFT results in this work for conﬁguration A, but not in conﬁgurations B or C. However, a more accurate investigation of charge ordering would require use of advanced DFT functionals such as hybrid exchange functionals [59, 60, 61] or extended Hubbard models (DFT+U+V ) [62, 63]. In their ﬁrst-principles study, Van der Ven, et al. [19] found conﬁguration B (as labeled in Figure 6) to have the lowest formation energy, followed closely by conﬁguration C. They make the observation, however, that the energy diﬀerence is small enough that it is diﬃcult to determine with certainty the true ground state solely from the ﬁrst-principles calculations. In our work, we take the zig-zag ordering of conﬁguration C to be the ground state based on the calculated formation energies, but we repeat the caveat that its calculated energy is close to that of the conﬁgurations with row ordering. The diﬀerences in energy between our results and those of earlier work are likely due to our using DFT+U, vdW-DF, and generalized gradient approximations (GGA), as opposed to using local-density approximations (LDA). 3.2.

Chemical potential data and phase diagram from Monte Carlo simulations Li content as a function of chemical potential and temperature was computed through Monte Carlo statistical mechanics calculations for temperatures ranging from 200 K to 400 K, initially without using the bias potentials. Since the bias potentials were not used in these calculations the two-phase regions are easily seen as gaps in the composition values of the data (see, for example, Figure 9). Regions with orderings are recognized by the steepness and positive slope of the curve traced out by connecting the chemical potential data points. This indicates a strongly convex free energy well and thermodynamic preference for these structures over the corresponding composition intervals. Two-phase regions appear on either side of these intervals. These data were used to construct an approximate phase diagram for O3 LCO, for Li compositions greater than x ≥1/3. The calculated phase diagram of the LixCoO2 system is shown in Figure 10. From the Monte Carlo results, the order-disorder transition temperature for the ordering at x = 0.5 is slightly greater than 330 K, which is consistent with experimental results [12]. An ordering is also predicted by the Monte Carlo results at x = 0.33, appearing below approximately 235 K. This ordering has not been seen experimentally at room temperature, but some reported evidence shows that it may exist at low temperatures [14], which is consistent with our calculations.

Similar to past ﬁrst-principles studies on LCO, however, because of the lack of the metal-insulator transition that leads to the two-phase region observed between ∼0.7-0.9 in calculations, the voltage plateau in the same region is not captured. We also note that the predicted voltage, as with the other Monte Carlo results in this work, is only for the O3 structure and, therefore, only valid for compositions greater than x ≈1/3. Additional Monte Carlo calculations were performed for temperatures of 260 K, 300 K, and 340 K, this time using bias potentials to sample within the unstable regions of order-disorder transition. Since the ﬂuctuations in the chemical potential around x = 0.5 are critical to representing the ordering in the phase ﬁeld models at temperatures below ∼330 K, dense sampling of chemical potential data was performed in that region for 260 K and 300 K. Additional sampling was also performed near the extreme compositions of x = 0 and x = 1 to help capture the divergent nature of the chemical potential (see Figure 12(a)). 3.2.3. Symmetry-adapted order parameters Symmetry-adapted order parameters are useful for tracking the order-disorder transition and the diﬀerent ordering variants that can form.

Phase ﬁeld simulations Here, we demonstrate our integrated scale bridging framework via three case studies of phase ﬁeld simu- lations that help gain some insight to the phase stability of LCO cathodes in the composition neighborhood of the order-disorder transition around x = 0.5. The thermodynamic description entering the phase ﬁeld model is quantitatively accurate, since it is the result of the scale bridging framework. Furthermore, we use appropriate kinetic data. However, some physics remains to be included in our model, such as strain eﬀects, which are known to cause LCO particle degradation [65, 66, 67], interphase interface energies, explicit representations of the diﬀerent orderings, and spatio-temporal heat generation/transport. Therefore, we do not claim to present fully quantitative predictions, but demonstrate at least how morphology evolves under various microstructure-speciﬁc, environmental, kinetic and cycling conditions at a resolution not accessible in experiments and at a computational ﬁdelity not previously accessed with regard to the length scales. From such simulations we make connections to observations in the experimental literature on degradation of LCO [65, 66, 67, 68]. In the ﬁrst set of phase ﬁeld simulations, the Li composition was initialized as a randomly perturbed ﬁeld about x = 0.53 for each of the three temperatures, within a circular domain with a diameter of 1 µm. No ﬂuxes were applied, and the composition ﬁeld was allowed to evolve until a steady state was achieved.

This shift toward higher compositions at the lower temperature for this particular two-phase region is qualitatively consistent with the phase diagram in Figure 10, although slight mismatches between the nonconvex region of the IDNN and the data, particularly at 260 K, has shifted the predicted compositions slightly lower than the values shown in the phase diagram.

The blue line shows the applied C-rate, and the red line shows the corresponding average Li composition of the particle. diﬀerent compositions for diﬀerent temperatures is also seen in the ratio of ordered to disordered phase in the transient microstructures observed at 300 and 260 K. Since the ratio of ordered to disordered phase is smaller at 300 K, circular precipitates (in 2D) of the ordered phase appear, whereas the ordered phase regions are elongated and more tortuous at 260 K. As seen in Figure 14, notable variations can arise in the morphology of the charged cathode particle in a temperature range that overlaps the window of relevance for actual batteries. For example, based on the ﬁgure, battery designers should anticipate morphology changes in charged lithium ion batteries in an electric vehicle parked outdoors in the summer during day versus night in many geographical locations. As observed by Pender et al. [67], lattice dimension changes in the neighborhood of x = 0.5 cause mechanical damage. Order-disorder transitions are pronounced over the 260−300 K range in Figure 14 and as the associated lattice dimension vary, the mismatches across the order-disorder interphase interfaces will cause stresses that may play a role in driving the damage [65]. We also note that the higher temperature disordered phase has a more homogeneous microstructure, and the simulation in Figure 14 predicts that it persists across the composition range studied.

The phase ﬁeld treatment also predicts higher driving forces for Li ﬂux in regions of rapidly varying interface curvature, which are seen at the lower temperatures. The lower mobility at 260 K relative to 300 K slows down transport despite the correspondingly greater curvature-induced driving force. Additional phase ﬁeld simulations show the eﬀect of cycling of a LixCoO2 particle at 260, 300, and 340 K, as presented in Figure 15 [57]. The Li composition was initialized to 0.5, following the recommended lower limit of composition for LCO, below which large c-axis variations of the lattice cause enhanced degradation [67]. This corresponds to an initial predicted voltage of 4.23 V. An initial current density of 0.1335 A m−2 was applied. The applied current density was adjusted to -0.2137, 0.1335, -0.0668, and 0 A m−2 at 500, 800, 1300, and 2000 s, respectively. This cycling corresponds to C-rates of 0.625, -1, 0.625, -0.3125, and 0 C, where a positive sign denotes discharging and negative is charging. This cycle results in a net discharging, as indicated by the voltage-composition plot in Figure 11, with a ﬁnal predicted voltage of 4.14, 4.17, or 4.19 V for 260, 300, or 340 K, respectively.

While the phase ﬁeld simulations in this work up to this point have used 1 µm diameter particles, experimental work by Choi et al. [66] has compared performance using micron sized LCO particles with that of 30-70 nm particles. Among other ﬁndings, they report that the cycle performance with these nanometer- sized particles is consistent, without deterioration, across their selected range of operating temperatures (258 to 333 K), and that the smaller sized particles lead to increase reliability. With this as motivation, spinodal decomposition and cycling phase ﬁeld simulations were performed using a 50 nm diameter particle, again with the temperatures 260, 300, and 340 K. The current density applied in the cycling simulations was scaled down by a factor of 20 to maintain the same C-rates in the smaller particles as in the larger, micron sized particles.

The applied current density is reduced by a factor of 20 compared with the 1 µm particles to maintain the same C-rates in both particle sizes (see Figure 15). The blue line shows the applied C-rate, and the red line shows the corresponding average Li composition of the particle. the equilibrium microstructures are comparable for both sizes, the transient microstructure is much simpler for the smaller particle. This is because the length scale of the transient microstructure in the simulations is deﬁned by the gradient coeﬃcient, which is related to the interfacial energy and is independent of the particle size. Since the length scale of the microstructure is maintained but the size of the particle is decreased, the result is a less complex microstructure. This reduced complexity could lead to diminished misﬁt stress eﬀects and increased reliability. The results from the cycling simulation for the 50 nm particles presented in Figure 17 show that, unlike with the larger particles, the Li composition ﬁeld is essentially the same for all three temperatures. This is because the particles are small enough that the relative values of the mobility, particle size, and microstruc- ture length scale lead the Li atoms to diﬀuse uniformly and extremely rapidly in comparison with the time scale of the simulation such that any temperature eﬀects are not seen. This, again, matches the experimental ﬁndings of Choi et al. [66] which show consistent performance across the temperature range of 258 to 333 K. 4.

The frame- work begins with DFT calculations of the formation energy of potential conﬁgurations and compositions of LixCoO2, bridging scales up through statistical mechanics Monte Carlo simulations and integrable deep neural network training, culminating in continuum phase ﬁeld modeling. In particular, through the DFT and Monte Carlo simulations, the framework identiﬁed the order-disorder transition around composition x = 0.5 at room temperature. This phase transition was subsequently captured within the neural network representation of the free energy and the formation and evolution of this transition was modeled in the phase ﬁeld simulations. Our study focused on phase stability has been developed, thus far, for the O3 structure of LCO. However, since H1-3 form of LCO is the stable structure below x = 1/3, our results do not hold in that range. The corresponding DFT studies are underway, and the results from them will be subject to our scale-bridging framework to ultimately present a complete study that will have rigorous predictive value over the entire composition range. We note that, since LCO has two distinct free energy curves in the composition ranges 0 < x ≤1/3 and 1/3 < x < 1, a phase ﬁeld treatment would not be thermodynamically rigorous over the entire composition range. Sharp interface methods such as levelsets present one appropriate framework in this setting.

The active learning approach would play an important role in directing this sampling, which would take place in a much higher dimensional space to generate training data for the IDNN. The choice of the U parameter was guided by matching with experimental voltage measurements in the x ∈[0, 1/2] and x ∈[0, 1] composition ranges (see Figure 3). This choice is ﬁnally reﬂected in the voltage reported across the entire x ∈[0, 1] composition range in Figure 11. We note that a diﬀerent approach to calibration could be to choose U for an optimal ﬁt across the composition range in Figure 11, although this would be a much more expensive and complex process that would have to fundamentally leverage the scale bridging between DFT and statistical mechanics. We further note that empirical approaches to determine the U parameter can be completely circumvented by using the recently developed self-consistent Hubbard method [69] where the site speciﬁc values of U are determined using density-functional perturbation theory and iterated self-consistently until convergence of the DFT +U ground-state. This approach seamlessly ties the U values to the changing composition through its dependence on the local chemical environment. We re-emphasize that while the LCO material system has been the subject of a vast body of computational study at the atomic as well as at the mesoscopic continuum scale and thermodynamic investigations, all supported by experimental campaigns, the extent of scale bridging has not extended as widely as in this communication, to", "page": 18, "position": 0}

We re-emphasize that while the LCO material system has been the subject of a vast body of computational study at the atomic as well as at the mesoscopic continuum scale and thermodynamic investigations, all supported by experimental campaigns, the extent of scale bridging has not extended as widely as in this communication, to the best of our knowledge. Our choice of LCO has been motivated by this deep and broad literature, which provides a robust basis for comparison as well as the interest in this material system. More broadly, this study also serves a demonstration of method development that will be applied to other interesting materials systems, with systematic incorporation of additional eﬀects. On this last note, our ﬁrst extension will be to the non-conserved symmetry-adapted order parameters, η discussed in Section 3.2.3. Other extensions are also possible to coupling the phase ﬁeld description with a thermodynamically rigorous treatment of heat generation and transport that will more completely reﬂect the phase diagram. Scale-bridged treatments of strain eﬀects, misﬁt elasticity, charge splitting as well as the dependence of coeﬃcients on all these ﬁelds are also accessible. An extension to the equations of electrochemistry at the active particle-electrolyte scale will allow the study of phenomena such as the mosaic instability observed in nanoparticulate batteries, wherein phase segregation occurs between distinct particles rather than within a single particle [70] as studied here. Even without such a level of rigorously obtained detailed physics, we note that the phase ﬁeld treatment exposes trends that both align with battery material particle and cell scale experiments, and present a platform for making technologically relevant projections as discussed in Section 3.4. Author contributions The study’s scale bridging methodology was developed by KG and GHT; electronic structure studies were planned by all the authors; electronic structure calculations were performed by GHT and SD; statistical mechanics and phase ﬁeld studies were carried out by GHT; the paper was written by all the authors.
