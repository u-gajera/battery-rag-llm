To increase their voltage window above the limit imposed by water splitting (∼1.23 V): hybrid aqueous-nonaqueous solvents17–20 and building on water-in-salt electrolytes,,21 alter- native water-in-organic strategies22,23 have shown an improvement, effectively suppressing water decomposition and proton intercalation and enabling operational windows of up to ∼1.6 V vs. Zn/Zn2+. Polymer-based24,25 and ionic liquid26-based electrolytes have also been investigated for ZIBs, identifying the formation of Zn dendrites as the major limitation to their cycle lives and electrochemical stabilities. Nonaqeuous mixtures of Zn salts and organic solvents have also been examined for their electrochemical and transport properties, 3", "page": 2, "position": 0}

These electrolyte mixtures, particularly those containing acetonitrile and propylene carbonate, dis- played reversible deposition on Zn anodes and wide electrochemical windows (up to 3.8 V vs. Zn/Zn2+), suggesting their potential application in ZIBs as electrolytes with a variety of cathode materials.27–30 Alongside the advancement on electrolytes, the development of high-performance ZIBs has also been directed toward the positive electrode.3 For instance, a measured capacity of 240 mAh/g at ∼1.3 V vs. Zn/Zn2+ has been reported for MnO2,10 leading to high energy densities. Promising operated voltages (∼1.7 V vs. Zn/Zn2+) have also been reported for a wide variety of materials, such as Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) and organic electrodes, albeit with the trade-off of reduced stability over repeated cycles and/or lower volumetric capacities.11 However, multivalent ions, and Zn2+ among them, are known to strongly interact with water and with the host electrode materials, leading to slower diffusion which, in turn, cor- relates with reduced reversibility and diminished cyclability. In all divalent intercalating electrode materials, mobility of the active ion is known to a primary concern.9,31 Hence, designing improved ZIB cathodes will require a deep understanding of Zn mobility. Over- all, Zn mobility in ZIBs is known to be primarily influenced by two key characteristics:32 (i) chemical factors, including electronegativity, which directly affects the covalent or ionic nature of bonds between Zn and the surrounding ionic framework;33,34 and (ii) structural and topological factors, such as the local bonding environment where stronger bonds may introduce energetic barriers to diffusivity35 and the dimensionality of percolating channels for Zn diffusion.10 Previous research on Zn-ion battery materials have investigated the influ- ence of these factors, employing them as design rules for the morphological and structural engineering of the diffusion pathways.11 Zn mobility has also been investigated computa- tionally through screenings of its preferred coordination in both activated and stable sites 4", "page": 3, "position": 0}

To date, there have been no extensive screening efforts involving candidate cathode materials that do not contain Zn or other working ions in their as-synthesized state. In contrast, experimental examples of such ’empty-host’ Zn cathodes are birnessite-MnO2,41 for which traces of elemental Zn are confirmed by energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX), and V2O5 polymorphs, which have been in- vestigated in the pre-inserted MxV2O5 form (where M = alkali metal, and 1.1 ≤x ≤1.2).42 Hence, screening efforts should include empty intercalation hosts, which often outperform structures containing the migrating ion,9,40 as they often present the active ion in a deep electrostatic potential well which in turn results in poorer mobility. In this work, we build upon previous works on Mg9 and Ca31 cathodes, employing exist- ing automated computational infrastructure9,43 to expand our understanding of the chemical space for divalent ion batteries and to identify candidate high-voltage multivalent cathodes for ZIBs. We first motivate screening criteria to select the most promising intercalation hosts, followed by high-throughput DFT calculations to explore the intercalation of Zn2+. We maintain the possibility for aqueous applications by integrating a well-established screen- ing criterion to evaluate candidate stability against passivation and corrosion in aqueous en- vironments, while also predicting the composition of the resulting passivation products.44,45 We then investigate ion mobility in the most promising Zn cathodes, highlighting the factors that influence Zn diffusivity. 2 Methods: Cathode discovery pipeline The screening funnel, represented on the left in Figure 1, follows a similar strategy to pre- vious searches9,43 for multivalent cathodes, in which successive tiers of the funnel require 5", "page": 4, "position": 0}

(1.1) Composition Screening: Exclusion of chemically a priori undesirable compositions, which includes precious metals, radioactive, toxic and redox-inactive elements. To focus our effort on empty host materials, in this tier, we also exclude Zn or other known working ions to simplify the evaluation of ion mobility and diffusivity. This screening narrowed the pool of potential candidates from 163,109 to 22,769 structures; (1.2) Stability/Synthesizability Screening: Exclusion of materials that may be too unstable to be synthesized and/or survive in the specific electrochemical working conditions for high-voltage ZIBs. This filter includes the evaluation of known descriptors for thermodynamic stability, such as the energy above the hull (the distance of a phase from the convex energy hull of its most stable phases)47,48 as well as a screening for reasonable thermodynamical stability against dissolution, passivation and/or corrosion in the event of aqueous applications. In total, this filter reduced the number of candidates from 22,769 to 6,980 viable materials.(1.3) Practical Screening: Selection of cost-effective and high- performance materials. This screening tier excluded elements with large cost to capacity ratio, as well as structural frameworks presenting similar crystal structure types and different transition metal (TM) ratios (e.g., NASICON structures (TM)2(PO4)3 with different TM combinations). This final screening tier reduced the optimal candidates from 6,980 to 4,297 structures, belonging to 1,181 distinct crystal structure types. Overall, this process narrowed the initial 163,109 structures to 1,181 candidates. 2.2 Tier 2: Ion insertion To identify potential intercalation sites for Zn2+, an insertion algorithm49 based on DFT- calculated electronic charge densities was employed to insert Zn2+ ions in empty host struc- tures. The algorithm was repeated for multiple Zn insertions until (i) the transition metal element in the resulting intercalated structure reaches the lowest available oxidation state; 7", "page": 6, "position": 0}

This tier required the calculation of sev- eral DFT-calculated properties for the intercalated structures, including stability, average intercalation voltage, energy density, and the optimized inserted structure, making it com- putationally expensive and hence impractical for large material databases. For this reason, we restricted the ion insertion calculations to candidate structures containing common high- voltage TMs (Mn, Co, Cr and Ni). Out of the 1,181 candidates, the ion insertion calculations were successfully completed for 313 of them. 2.2.1 Additional Screening and Prototype Matching The top-performing intercalated materials from the insertion electrode calculations were fur- ther screened based the properties calculated in Tier 2, selecting high-performance materials (presenting high average intercalation voltages, gravimetric capacities and energy densities > 300 Wh/kg). The materials, as a function of state of charge, were then filtered for stabil- ity against conversion reactions,50 using data from the Materials Project phase diagram,51 pymatgen.52 A more detailed description of the filtering criteria is provided in the SI. These conditions, not present in previous cathode pipelines,9,31 ensured that candidate materials were thermodynamically stable, and exhibited reasonable protection against dissolution in aqueous media.10,44 This screening reduced the 313 candidates obtained in Tier 1 to the 37 best performing materials. For the last tier of calculations, priority was given to candidates whose structural frameworks closely match known synthesized materials among the 37 best performers. The framework assessment was conducted by matching structures to those in the 5.3.0 version of the Inorganic Crystal Structure Database (ICSD) via pymatgen through both exact and “looser” structure matches, accounting for structural disorder and doping. In the subset structure match, we permitted matches between candidate and ICSD materials upon substitution of candidate TM sites with other isovalent TMs, and/or substitution of 8", "page": 7, "position": 0}

These 12 candidates were then subjected to mobility calculations, which are detailed in the following section. 2.3 Tier 3: Ion mobility In the third tier of the screening funnel, the working ion sites of the top 12 performers were used to construct a MigrationGraph,53 mapping the interconnected network of metastable ion sites through a series of “hops”.43 This step identifies symmetrically equivalent sites and hops, generates potential migration pathways, and collects them into a periodic MigrationGraph document.54 Compounds without periodically repeatable Zn migration were discarded, limit- ing this computationally expensive step to only the candidates displaying feasible migration. As an approximation of Zn2+ mobility, we used ApproxNEB55 to evaluate the energy profile of the migration pathways. ApproxNEB, as implemented in the atomate56 and atomate257 packages, offers a robust and efficient alternative to NEB58 by decoupling images along the reaction coordinate and replacing the NEB spring forces with constrained relax- ation of the ionic coordinates. In this work, all ApproxNEB calculations were conducted using a structure within the deintercalated/dilute limit, with only one Zn ion in the sim- ulation supercell. To accurately represent the dilute limit and avoid self-interaction effects between Zn ions in neighboring periodic cells, the intercalated structures were generated using pymatgen52 to ensure that periodic Zn images are at least 7 ˚A apart. The structures were then relaxed using DFT with the working ion and its antipodal site fixed, yielding migration energies. In particular, the energy barriers associated with the hops between sites were calculated and mapped onto their respective migration graphs, calculating the shortest percolating pathways through Dijkstra’s algorithm.

Of the candidates identified in Tier 1, 88.2% are filtered out by the Tier 2 criteria: 21.7% due to low average theoretical intercalation voltages, 62.6% due to stability requirements, and 42.5% with below-threshold gravimetric capacities or energy densities.

Figure 3 demonstrates that cations such as Ni4+, Co4+ and Cr5+ exhibit higher voltage distributions, which corre- lates with heavier redox-active cations within the same period or those with higher oxidation states.65,66 A more detailed description of the effect of the polyanions and the redox centers on the potential of the host materials is provided in Section Structural and Chemistry Effects.

Unfortunately, in this specific polymorph, the ApproxNEB re- sults did not highlight the presence of alternative Zn migration pathways that could expand the dimensionality of the diffusion framework. However, as shown in Figure 5b this pathway can, in principle, offshoot into a 676 meV hop between adjacent B and C sites, providing access to otherwise inaccessible metastable sites and forming an expanded 1D diffusion path- way (PathwayII) that is a superset of PathwayI, increasing the theoretical capacity of the material while maintaining the overall 1D dimensionality of the migration pathway. This result is consistent with the literature: as further expanded in Section Evaluating Mate- rial Design Rules, tavorite-based materials have been associated with lower-dimensional migration pathways due to the high-overlap motifs present between their polyhedra.

This result may pose challenges for the performance of the material unless nanosized.72 However, the presence of multiple migration pathways in mp-26924 suggests that symmetry breaking within structures with high overlap motifs, such as tavorites, could introduce alternative, potentially lower-energy migration pathways. 3.2.3 Mn2(PO4)3 (mp-26062) Table 1 displays the theoretical properties calculated for NASICON Mn2(PO4)3 (mp-26062). The discharged structure Zn0.5Mn2(PO4)3 exhibits an average intercalation voltage of 1.77 V vs Zn/Zn2+, a volume change of 20%, and an aqueous instability = 450 meV/atom against P(OH)2−, Zn2+, MnO4−. Its intercalated phase exhibits an energy above the hull 60 meV/atom and a high theoretical gravimetric capacity of 240.02 mAh/g and energy density of 424.23 Wh/kg. Mn2(PO4)3 belongs to the trigonal R3 space group. Consistently with its trigonal sym- metry, its calculated lattice parameters a = b = 8.16 ˚A, c = 22.25 ˚A, and relative angles of α = β = 90.00◦, γ = 120.00◦. Mn2(PO4)3 adopts a 3D structural framework, presenting two in- equivalent Mn sites forming MnO6 octahedra, which share oxygen corners with six equivalent PO4 tetrahedra. In this structure, Zn can be intercalated in one of two non-symmetrically equivalent Zn sites, labeled A and B, with the former being lower in energy due to its location in a low-energy cavity (1a Wyckoff position). The ApproxNEB calculations for this material reveal multiple migration pathways, each presenting three hops: two symmetrically equiva- lent 886 meV hops connecting A and B sites, and one symmetrically unique 894 meV hop between adjacent B sites. Multiple pathways are identified in the host structure, resulting in a 3D migration network (Figure 5d). This result is consistent with previous findings for 19", "page": 18, "position": 0}

These factors may include structural aspects - such as polyhedral distor- tions,77,78 the density of the host framework79 (e.g., the volume per anion/cation ratio), and low-overlap motifs that facilitate ion migration,31 as well as more chemical/environmental factors, like the coordination environment and stability of mobile ions,40,80,81 and electro- static interactions of the host framework82–84 with the working ion. The following section will highlight the descriptors that have been identified as potential material design principles in the most promising candidate materials, evaluating their impact on Zn-ion diffusion and the overall performance of candidate cathode materials in ZIBs. 4.1 Structural and Chemistry Effects. As detailed in Section Screening Results, the potential of the screening endeavor in identi- fying the most promising candidates is confirmed by their similarity to previously investigated structures (e.g. polymorphs) and ICSD prototypes, many of which are recognized as effective materials for intercalation-based energy storage. In response to the focus on high-voltage, high-energy applications, it is not surprising that all four candidates identified through this screening are polyanion compounds, specifically (fluoro)phosphates. As discussed in Section Screening Results, this trend arises from the strong inductive effect of polyanion groups, where the robust P–O covalency stabilizes the reduced state and enhances the material’s re- dox potential. The presence of fluorine, with its high electronegativity, further amplifies this 20", "page": 19, "position": 0}

This trend has been previously observed in both Li-ion62,63 and Na-ion64 batteries, where (fluoro)phosphates cathode materials typically exhibit high voltages. A similar trend is observed for the redox centers: the best-performing candidates present Co4+, Cr5+, and Mn4+/Mn5+ as redox centers in their charged state. These ions align with the expected trends for high-voltage cathodes:65,66 Co4+, Cr5+, and Mn4+/Mn5+ are all ‘late’ period IV ions at high oxidation states, which exhibit small ionic radius, high ionization energies and, as a consequence, high redox potential. Moreover, the top four candidate materials belong to well-established structural families, such as NASICONs and tavorites.74 For instance, CoPO4F (mp-25444) and CrOPO4 (mp-772173) both structurally belong to the tavorite family (general formula M(XO4)Y, where M = Fe, V, Ti, Mn, Co, ..., X = P, S, W, ..., Y = F, O, OH74). Tavorite frameworks are known for their high structural tolerance to intercalation, which results in a higher degree of successful topotactic insertion. The insertion sites connect through open channels, enhancing intercalation kinetics and in some cases enable multi-channel ionic transport and fast ion migration.49 For these reasons, these materials have been extensively studied for their potential in lithium ion batteries. While similar compounds (e.g. VPO4F and FePO4F, as well as orthorhombic polymorphs of CoPO4F) have shown promise as cathodes in monovalent ion batteries,67,85–91 the triclinic polymorphs of CoPO4F and CrOPO4 remain experimentally unexplored. However, their frameworks match ICSD entries such as SbOPO4 (mp-9750),92 high-temperature polymorphs of NbOPO4, specifically β-NbOPO4 (mp-542453),93–95 and with VOPO4, which have recently attracted interest as cathode materials for monovalent53,96,97 and divalent98,99 ion batteries. Unlike its monoclinic counterpart, the orthorhombic CrOPO4 polymorph (mp-26924) does not strictly belong to the tavorite family, as this form features a more distorted phosphate framework. However, the structure also aligns with the symmetry group of β-VOPO4 (mp- 25265),100,101 a known framework for 3D ion migration85,102 and versatile intercalation,53,96,97 making it reasonable to anticipate a similar behavior from its CrOPO4 polymorph.

X = P, S, W, ...74) has also been the object of several pre- vious investigations, highlighting the influence of structural and compositional descriptors - such as polyhedral distortions and disproportionation reactions at the redox-active sites - on the resulting performance and electrical conductivity of these materials77,78 and suggesting various synthetic strategies103,104 and design guidelines62,105 to optimize the overall perfor- mance of these materials. While specific diffusion pathways for Mn2(PO4)3 have yet to be reported, NASICON-type phosphates have been widely investigated as cathode materials for both Li and Na ion batteries.73,74 Mn2(PO4)3, in particular, shows an ICSD subset match to Nb2(PO4)3 (mp-17242),106 a known anode material in Li- and Na-ion batteries107 char- acterized by diagonal diffusion paths, suggesting that a similar diffusion behavior might be expected for Mn2(PO4)3. A more detailed description of the computational and experimental research on these materials is detailed in Section S2 the SI of this work. Overall, the struc- tural parallels displayed by the candidate materials to studied cathode frameworks show that known structural motifs can be applied for the prediction and design of new intercalation hosts, emphasizing the role of structure as a transferable descriptor for ion mobility. 4.2 Evolving environment. The changing crystalline environment surrounding the working ion throughout a migration event, known as evolving environment,9 is another descriptor affecting the mobility of the working ion. The origin of this descriptor stems from work by Rong et al,40 which illustrated a correlation between migration barriers and ion topology in host frameworks. In the paper, the authors suggested that higher barriers often occur in environments in which the preferred 22", "page": 21, "position": 0}

This trend has been confirmed in computational screening studies for Mg2+ and Ca2+ 9,31 electrode materials, motivating further exploration into the behavior of Zn2+. Zn2+ is known to exhibit a preferred 4- or 6-fold coordination depending on the anion/base strengths of the surrounding ions and on the spatial constraints of the evolving environment.108 In our calculations, we quantified the influence of the evolving environment on the energy landscape of Zn2+ migration in candidate materials. In particular, in Figures 6a-6d we show the Zn2+ energy landscape of the four best performing candidates in the most kinetically hindered hops (or bottleneck hops), represented using the VESTA software109) of the Ap- proxNEB migration pathways analyzed in Section ApproxNEB results, as these provide an indications of the factors that affect ion mobility in Zn2+ diffusion. The plots are color- coded to depict the varying Zn2+ coordination at different positions along the migration hops, as analyzed using the CrystalNN algorithm in pymatgen.52,110 They also depict the distance between the mobile Zn2+ and the nearest cation (by average) in the host structure. In general, poor migration is expected to arise in materials where Zn2+ resides in strong potential well, leading to restricted mobility. Conversely, improved mobility is expected for topologies where the mobile ion is stabilized by its preferred coordination at the activated site. However, notably, we find that in these materials the strongest influence on the activation barrier is the repulsion between the Zn2+ and the closest cation. For instance, in CoPO4F (mp-25444), the highest-energy point occurs when six-fold coordinated Zn squeezes through an anion cavity formed by four O atoms and two F atoms in equivalent, non corner-sharing CoO4F2 octahedra. In the two CrOPO4 polymorphs and in Mn2(PO4)3, the migration en- ergy bottleneck occurs when Zn migrates through anion cavities formed between redox-active TM polyhedra and PO4 tetrahedra - respectively three O atoms in adjacent CrO6 octahe- dra in CrOPO4 (mp-772173), resulting in three-fold coordination, four O atoms in CrO5 trigonal bipyramids in CrOPO4 (mp-26924), displaying four-fold coordination, and five O", "page": 22, "position": 0}

As shown in Fig. 6, in the majority of cases, the highest-energy points correspond to the closest distance between Zn and its nearest cation and/or to the lowest Zn coordination in the host. Interestingly, at shorter Zn-cation distances (< 2.7 ˚A), we observe a modulation between coordination and electrostatics. This modulation is evident in the case of CrOPO4, for which the activation barrier is set for the 3-fold coordinated site, slightly offset from the closest cation-cation distance. The high energy results from a combination of structural constraints, which restrict the available space for Zn diffusion within the host structure, and electrostatic repulsion between Zn and the closest cation. Similar effects are well-known in the layered and rocksalt Li-ion cathode materials:40 first shown by Van der Ven and Ceder,80,111,112 lithium migration follows a divalent mechanism via a tetrahedral ac- tivated state, where the migrating Li+ remains in close proximity to a transition metal. This model predicts maximal lithium diffusivity in partially delithiated phases, aligning with ex- perimental observations. Higher Li diffusion was attributed to Li vacancies, which lower the energy of the activated states by decreasing the electrostatic repulsion between the activated lithium ion and its neighboring cations, and was later confirmed for a variety of layered and spinel materials.83,84,113 Additionally, in a similar fashion to Li, we note that at high charge, the repulsive interaction between Zn and the transition metal in the host structure is signif- icantly influenced by the oxidation state of the transition metal, as higher oxidation states will result in higher electrostatic interactions with the migrating ion and, leading to higher activation barriers.84,111,112,114 Interestingly, while current Li-ion cathodes are synthesized in the discharged state—where repulsive interactions intensify as the transition metal valence state increases—the candidate Zn-ion cathodes, for which the computed barriers correspond to the charged state, are expected to exhibit a decrease in cation repulsion with increased intercalation and with the consequent reduction of the redox-active transition metal cen- ters. Overall, our work underscores the crucial influence of both structural and electrostatic interactions on ion mobility, offering insights for the design of", "page": 23, "position": 0}

The first stage applied property screening based on composition, stability and synthesizability, and practical considerations, focusing on key performance descriptors such as operating voltage windows and gravimetric energy densities. The screening criteria were then integrated with density functional theory (DFT) calculations to evaluate Zn-ion intercalation and diffusion in the materials, further refining the selection through comparison with similar, experimentally synthesized structures from the Inorganic crystal structure database (ICSD). Focusing on high-voltage cathode applications, the initial dataset was narrowed to four top-performing candidates: CoPO4F (mp-25444), two polymorphs of CrOPO4 (mp-772173, mp-26924), and Mn2(PO4)3 (mp-26062). Our analysis of these materials for material design descriptors emphasized a correlation between ion mobility and common structural motifs in the host structures: the high voltages presented by the four best candidates are attributed to the stabilizing effect of phosphates and fluorophosphates on high-voltage redox centers through inductive effect, as well as the presence of ‘late’ period IV ions at high oxidation states (Co4+, Cr5+, and Mn4+/Mn5+). These trends, previously observed in Li- and Na-ion batteries,,62–66 are here extended to ZIBs. Furthermore, the presence of feasible interca- lation sites/pathways and favorable migration barriers (< 1 eV) are ascribed to structural features of the host frameworks, which present high tolerance to intercalation, fully connected migration networks and deviations from the classical frameworks that introduce distorted morphologies. We find that the repulsion between Zn and the nearest cation correlates the most strongly with the activation energy barrier, with slight modulation for the local en- vironment. This suggests that the anticipated migration barriers may be ameliorated at partial discharge. We note that removing materials with multiple movable ions (e.g. Li+, Na+, Mg2+, Zn2+, etc) in the pipeline also removes the possibilty of designing for coordinated motion. Future studies may explore alternative screening criteria, including frameworks containing working ions and/or that have demonstrated high performance with other multivalent ions.

S1.1 Tier 1: Property Screening Composition screening. The composition screening evaluated the following criteria: (i) the presence of at least one transition metal capable of undergoing reduction reactions upon Zn insertion (Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Nb, Mo, Ru, Ag, W, Re, Sb, and Bi); (ii) the presence of either O or S in the host structure; (iii) the absence of radioactive, toxic, and/or expensive elements, including As, Au, Ir, Pt, Pd, Rh, Tc, and elements with atomic number greater than 83; (iv) the absence of Zn or other intercalating ions, such as H, Li, Na, Ca, Mg, and K, to simplify the evaluation of ion mobility and diffusivity. This screening narrowed the pool of potential candidates from 154,718 to 22,769 structures. Stability/synthesizability screening. In this tier, materials were screened for (i) an energy above the hulla < 0.1 eV/atom, in agreement with established thresholds:47,48 struc- tures that are unstable in their charged state are unlikely to be stable during the discharge process; (ii) aqueous instability < 0.5 eV/atom, measured at 1.5 V vs. Zn/Zn2+ and a pH range of 5-5.5, ensuring that the material does not decompose in water and that stable solid phases are present in decomposed products. The aqueous stability is calculated using the PourbaixDiagram module in pymatgen.52,115 The choice of looser criteria on aqueous sta- bility is motivated by the possible formation of passivation layers on the materials, which aThe energy above the hull is defined as the distance of a phase from the hull composed by its most stable phases, and it is a measure of its thermodynamic stability.45 S1", "page": 46, "position": 0}

Practical screening. This stage screened the following properties: (i) a price per unit capacity < $0.005/mAh, excluding systems with a large fraction of expensive elements from the database; (ii) gravimetric capacity > 100 mAh/g, motivated by the search for high- performance materials. This final screening tier reduced the optimal candidates from 6,980 to 4,297 structures. Two further screening criteria were applied to the selected structures: a (iii) structural screening, in which only one representative structure was selected for materi- als with the same formula/structural framework but different transition metal (TM) ordering or ratios (e.g., NASICON structures (TM)2(PO4)3 with different TM combinations). This screening was performed using structure matching capabilities in pymatgen;52 a (iv) TM screening, in which systems containing Mn, Co, Cr, and Ni were prioritized due to their favorable voltages and high material availability. The 4,297 structures were thus reduced to 1,181 distinct crystal structure types. Overall, this final screening tier reduced the optimal candidates from 6,980 to 1,181 structures with distinct crystal structures. S1.2 Tier 2: ion insertion S1.2.1 Additional Screening and Prototype Matches The 313 intercalated materials presenting successful insertion electrode calculations were further screened based on the same stability and synthesizability criteria employed in Tier 1 of the screening, with the addition of the following criteria: (i) an energy above the hull < 0.1 eV/atom for all the structures obtained in the insertion algorithm to construct voltage pairs; (ii) average intercalation voltage > 1.3 V vs. Zn/Zn2+; (iii) gravimetric capacity > 160 mAh/g; (iv) energy density > 300 Wh/kg. These criteria were chosen to target high voltage and energy density cathodes. Finally, we required (v) a volume change upon intercalation lower than 20% to account for the typically higher volume changes seen in Zn2+ intercalation S2", "page": 47, "position": 0}

The threshold of 0.5 V is based on DFT-calculated data which has been benchmarked on experimental values.50 These conditions ensured that the candidate cathodes fit within high performance and stability standards, as well as within the thermodynamic stability window of common aque- ous electrolytes.10,44 More, they introduce new screening criteria which had not been con- sidered in previous multivalent cathode pipelines.9,31 This screening Tier reduced the 226 candidates obtained in Tier 2 to the 37 best performing materials. In particular, of the 37 materials, 33 (89%) met the conversion voltage criterion. This result represents a significant improvement over Tier 2 candidates (for which only 51%, corresponding to 116 materials had passed this threshold), underscoring the effectiveness of using thermodynamic criteria to identify promising materials. S2 Literature Background The following section provides literature background on the state-of-the-art research on the most promising candidate materials and their ICSD matches in batteries involving Zn and other working ions.

Improvements have been seen with in-situ carbon modification, achieving 107 mAh/g per Na atom120 in Na2CoPO4F by coating the particles and employing a high-voltage electrolyte.

For the insertion electrode calculations, accurate compara- ble energies across chemical systems were obtained by employing PBE in the absence of transition metal oxides and sulfides, PBE+U otherwise, and mixing energies from the two calculation methodologies using the established procedure in Materials Project.46,134 All Ap- proxNEB calculations employed PBE without a Hubbard U correction. Although electronic self-interaction error tends to be highest in stretched radical bonds typical of a transition state,135 the optimal Hubbard U value to eliminate this self-interaction error cannot be calculated easily in high throughput and would require, e.g., a costly calculation via lin- ear response.136 More, using a fixed value of U which is not optimized along the migration path has been shown not to be more performant in predicting accurate barriers via NEB and ApproxNEB.35,98,137–139 Chosen numerical and convergence parameters for these calcula- tions are identical to those in previously published work,31,140 employing the MPRelaxSet as implemented in pymatgen.52 The critical electronic self-consistency (INCAR) settings are sum- marized as follows: structural relaxation was performed until the total energy was converged within 5×10−4 eV and the forces on each atom were converged within 0.05 eV/˚A; the plane- wave energy cutoff was set to 520 eV; all calculations used Gaussian smearing of the Fermi surface with smearing width 0.05 eV.
