The battery capacity is an important indicator of a battery. How to improve the capacity of quantum batteries is of importance. We consider quantum batteries given by bipartite quantum systems, and study the enhancement of the battery capacity under local projective measurements on a subsystem of the quantum state. By using the two-qubit Bell diagonal states and the X-type states as examples, we show that the quantum battery capacity with respect to the whole system or the subsystem could be improved by local projective measurements. Our theoretical analysis will provide new ideas for the experimental development of quantum battery.

With the development of quantum technology and informa- tion science, the quantum battery has emerged and been expected to balance the advantages of small size, large capacity, portability, rapid charging etc. R. Al- icki and M. Fannes ﬁrst formally introduced the idea of quantum batteries in an informational theoretic con- text by characterizing the maximum amount of energy that can be extracted from a quantum system under unitary operations [1]. Since then there have been ex- tensive theoretical [2–53] and experimental[54–58] stud- ies on quantum batteries. For example, many theo- retical protocols have been proposed, such as charg- ing by entangling operations[6, 7, 9, 14, 29, 36], charg- ing with dissipative[29, 30], charging collectively and in parallel[10, 30]. Many-body interaction and energy ﬂuc- tuation were also explored[11, 13, 25–27, 37, 38, 48].

The ﬁrst model of a quantum battery that could be engineered in a solid-state architecture, was proposed by Ferraro et al.[10]. Many other concrete quantum battery models have been also proposed[11, 19, 52]. However, many as- pects of the physics of quantum batteries remain unex- plored, experimental work on quantum batteries is still in its infancy and a fully-operational proof of principle is yet to be demonstrated. For a review of quantum batteries, we refer to Ref.[50]. An important quantitative indicator of the quality of quantum batteries is the capacity (charging power, work storage, work extraction) [31, 42]. The commonly used quantity is the ergotropy functional [31], E(ρ, H) = max U∈U(d){T r[ρH] −T r[UρU †H]}, where ρ is the quantum state of a d-dimensional quan- tum system Q with Hamiltonian H, the maximum takes over the states under all unitary evolution ρ →UρU †, with U(d) the set of the unitary operators acting on Q. More recently, in Ref. [42] the authors provided a new deﬁnition of quantum battery capacity, C(ρ, H) := d−1 X i=0 ǫi(λi −λd−1−i), (1) where λ0 ≤λ1 ≤· · · ≤λd−1 denote the eigenvalues of the quantum state ρ and ǫ0 ≤ǫ1 ≤· · · ≤ǫd−1 denote the eigenenergies of the Hamiltonian H = P i ǫi|εi⟩⟨εi|. C(ρ, H) is a Schur-convex functional of the quantum state and does not change when the battery is unitar- ily charged or discharged. Quantum measurements, particularly the projections onto a chosen state, could change the transition rate of the measured system [59]. Numerous measurement-based control schemes have been applied to state puriﬁcation [60, 61], information gain [62] and entropy production [63]. The measurement on auxiliary systems may help to control the target systems, serving as state-engineering scheme through a nonunitary procedure [64, 65]. In", "page": 0, "position": 1}

In [49] the authors focused on the en- ergy extraction instead of charging, that is, the protocol includes only one measurement on the auxiliary qubit, but not a sequence of measurements. Scenarios are in- vestigated for both that the initial state of the battery and the auxiliary is a product and an entangled one. It is shown that the measurement-based protocol provides sig- niﬁcantly better energy extraction from a quantum bat- tery than that based on unitary operations. Consider a bipartite system composed of the target quantum state A and the auxiliary system B. Our ques- tion is how the quantum measurements on the systems B would aﬀect the quantum battery capacity of the system A or the whole bipartite system. In this paper, we for- mulate a unilateral measurement protocol and study such local projective measurement-enhanced quantum battery capacity by starting directly from general bipartite quan- tum states. In general, a complete quantum battery con- sists of a battery part and a charger part. Here, we only consider the battery part, that is, the whole system bat- tery is composed by two-particle quantum state ρAB and the system Hamiltonian HAB. And the battery of the subsystem is composed by the reduced state ρA and the Hamiltonian HA corresponding to the subsystem A. We use the deﬁnition of quantum battery capacity given by Eq.(1). We ﬁnd that for two-qubit Werner states, the local measurements can enhance the overall or the sub- system battery capacity.

Two-qubit Bell-diagonal states We ﬁrst consider the initial states to be the two-qubit Bell-diagonal ones: ρAB = 1 4(I2 ⊗I2 + 3 X i=1 ciσi ⊗σi), where σ1, σ2, σ3 are the standard Pauli matrices, ci are real constants such that ρAB is a well deﬁned density matrix. ρAB have eigenvalues λ0 = (1 −c1 −c2 −c3)/4, λ1 = (1 −c1 + c2 + c3)/4, λ2 = (1 + c1 −c2 + c3)/4 and λ3 = (1+c1 +c2−c3)/4.

{"chunk_id": "2405.03093v1_p2_c0", "doc_id": "2405.03093v1", "text": "3 We consider the following Hamiltonian for the two-qubit system, HAB = ǫAσ3 ⊗I2 + ǫBI2 ⊗σ3, (5) where ǫA ≥ǫB ≥0. The eigenvalues of HAB are −ǫA − ǫB, −ǫA + ǫB, ǫA −ǫB and ǫA + ǫB in ascending order. Therefore, we have C(ρAB, HAB) = (|c1|+|c2|)(ǫA+ǫB)+(|c1|−|c2|)(ǫA−ǫB). The reduced states of ρAB are ρA = I2/2 and ρB = I2/2. Consequently, we have C(ρA, HA) = 0. Consider local projective measurement given by the computational base {|k⟩}, {Πk = |k⟩⟨k|, k = 0, 1}. The measurement gives rise to the ensemble {ρk AB, Pk}. We have Pkρk AB = (I2 ⊗Πk)ρAB(I2 ⊗Πk) = 1 4[I2 ⊗Πk + 3 X i=1 ciσi ⊗(ΠkσiΠk)] = 1 4[I2 ⊗Πk + (−1)kc3σ3 ⊗Πk], (6) where we have used the relations ΠkσjΠk = 0 for k = 0, 1, j = 1, 2, Π0σ3Π0 = Π0 and Π1σ3Π1 = −Π1.

We obtain C(ρ′ AB, HAB) = (µ0 −µ1 + |c3|)(ǫA+ǫB)+(µ1−µ0+|c3|)(ǫA−ǫB) and C(ρ′ A, HA) = 2(µ0 −µ1)ǫA|c3|. In this", "page": 2, "position": 0}

In this case, the local measurement could either reduce or increase the battery capacity of the whole system, but always increase the battery capacity of the subsystem A. (iii) When c3 = 0, f := C(ρ′ A, HA) −C(ρA, HA) is always zero. However, for the ρ′ AB given in (ii), one has C(ρ′ AB, HAB) = 2(µ0 −µ1)ǫB. The above observations show that the unilateral mea- surement on subsystem B may increase the battery ca- pacity of the subsystem A, but not always the entire sys- tem. Example 1: Let us consider a speciﬁc Bell-diagonal state with c1 = c2 = c3 = −a, i.e., the two-qubit Werner state [66], ρW = a|ψ−⟩⟨ψ−| + 1 −a 4 I4, where |ψ−⟩= (|01⟩−|10⟩)/ √ 2 is the maximally entan- gled state and 0 ≤a ≤1. ρW is separable when a ≤1 3 and entangled otherwise. From the observation (ii), we see that after the projective measurement on subsystem B, the battery capacity of the subsystem A increases as long as a ̸= 0 and ǫA > 0, no matter if the original state is separable or entangled. When µ0 −µ1 > a, the measure- ment on the subsystem B can also increase the battery capacity of the whole system. When µ0 −µ1 = a, the battery capacity of the whole system keeps unchanged. Therefore, for a random probability combination Eq.(4), by choosing appropriate parameters the local projective measurement may enhance the battery capacity of the overall or the individual subsystem.

The reduced density matrix ρA has eigenvalues δ0 = (1+x)/3 and δ1 = (2−x)/3. Therefore, C(ρAB, HAB) = 2 3(ǫA + ǫB) + 1−2x 3 (ǫA −ǫB) and C(ρA, HA) = 2 1−2x 3 ǫA.

There are also other studies on quantum batteries by using quantum measurements [7, 9, 41, 43, 49], but with diﬀerent ex- traction protocols. Our study has some advantages com- pared with, for example, the one in the latest Ref.[41]. Firstly, we adopted the latest deﬁnition of quantum bat- tery capacity, and our protocol starts directly from the bipartite quantum states, without considering the auxil- iary systems. Secondly, Ref.[41] requires multiple mea- surements and the assistance of POVM measurements. Here, our protocol only involves one projective measure- ment. Moreover, we have provided the analytical results when the initial state is a general 2-qubit quantum state. The quantum battery capacity is unitary invariant and solely given by the eigenvalues of the quantum states and the Hamiltonian. There are relationships between the battery capacity and the quantum resources such as quantum entropy, entanglement and coherence [36, 42]. We have shown that the improvement of quantum bat- tery capacity is related to both the initial states and the combination forms of the ﬁnal states. Our results indi- cate that the local projection measurement is a kind of important resource for improving the capacity of quan- tum batteries. It would also interesting to investigate the impact of general positive operator-valued measures on the improvement of quantum battery capacities.
