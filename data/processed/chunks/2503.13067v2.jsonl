Introduction In different disciplines of science and technology, the rational design of modern materials is the ultimate goal. Over the past one to two decades, tremendous effort has been made by the materials science community to compile the large dataset of materials with different properties from multiple sources1–3 so as to provide easy access of database repository to scientists and engineers to aid in novel materials discovery using artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML). In every domain such as material science, medical science, social science, advance technology, etc., there is a growing demand for new high performance, highly efficient and robust materials. Since last couple of decades, the Li-ion battery (LIB) is being used as a prominent renewable energy storage device and is reigning in all major electronic applications from tiny watch to large battery in EV sector and it captures most of the shares in the commercial market.4 But different environment friendly renewable energy sources (solar, wind, etc.) and their utilization augments the need for higher density and highly durable energy storage materials. High manufacturing cost, low abundance of Li metal and paucity of other constituent metallic elements used in the electrode and other factors hinder further commercialization of existing battery technology to meet the current demand.4 To overcome these challenges, researchers are moving towards anode-free metal-ion battery5,6 and other earth abundant active metal-ion battery such as Na, Zn etc.7–10 Developing new electrode materials with high energy density and long cycle life, com- parable to lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), remains a significant challenge.

To solve these issues, researchers are try- ing to utilize the fast growing and high-in demand AI11 and ML12 techniques with the latest updated battery data repository such as Materials Project (MP),13 OQMD,14,15 AFlowLib,16 ESP,17 CMR,18 NOMAD,19 ICSD,20 COD,21 NASA,22,23 etc. Machine learning (ML) has emerged as a powerful tool for screening potential materi- als (with applications in battery, catalysis, solar cell, etc) due to its ability to significantly accelerate the discovery process compared to traditional density functional theory (DFT) calculations.24 While DFT provides high-fidelity electronic structure insights and reliable predictions of material properties, it is still computationally expensive, especially for large- scale materials exploration.25 In contrast, ML models, once trained on high-quality DFT or experimental data, can predict key material properties with orders-of-magnitude greater efficiency, enabling rapid screening of vast chemical spaces.24,26 ML is particularly advan- tageous for identifying promising candidates early in the design process, reducing the need for exhaustive DFT calculations.27 However, ML models rely heavily on the quality and diversity of their training data, and their predictions may lack the fundamental physical in- terpretability of first-principles methods like DFT.28 Despite this, integrating ML with DFT in a hybrid approach can enhance both accuracy and efficiency, leveraging DFT’s robustness while exploiting ML’s speed to optimize the search for high-performance battery materials. Significant progress has recently been experienced in the search of new electrode ma- terials, via prediction of battery voltages,29,30 volume change,30 chemical reaction,31 and formation energy31 of electrode materials using a variety of ML techniques in conjunction with the well captured clean battery database.

However, complex phase transitions during insertion and extraction, lead to challenges such as poor cycle stability, low energy density, and limited rate capability. To address these challenges, researchers have explored various strategies for optimizing Li/Na-ion cathodes. In this work, we leverage a DNN model developed using the PyTorch library to design novel layered transition metal oxide based compositions. Our model is robust and highly predictive, outperforming previously published approaches for voltage prediction.29–31 Feature engineering plays a crucial role in materials informatics, where properties derived from chemical, structural, elemental, electronic, and thermodynamic representations are used to construct feature vectors. By incorporating these effective strategies, we trained our DNN model to predict the voltage of electrode materials with high accuracy. As a result, we identified several promising cathode materials for Na- ion batteries with high voltage and energy density. To validate our predictions, we further conducted first-principles DFT simulations, confirming the potential of these materials for next-generation Na-ion batteries. The Rise of Na-Ion Batteries in Energy Storage Researchers are increasingly focusing on sodium-ion (Na-ion) batteries as a promising al- ternative to lithium-ion (Li-ion) technology due to several key advantages in cost, resource availability, and sustainability (Figure 1). One of the most significant benefits of Na-ion batteries is their lower material cost, with a theoretical cost of $40-77/kWh, making them 30% cheaper than LiFePO4 based lithium-ion batteries.48,49 This cost advantage is particu- larly crucial given the rising costs and scarcity of lithium, which has led to an increase in production expenses for Li-ion batteries, reaching an average of $137/kWh in 2020. In terms of energy density, Na-ion batteries offer up to 290 Wh/kg for active materials and 250-375 Wh/L volumetric energy density, making them competitive for energy storage applications. However, current practical Na-ion prototypes have a lower energy density (75-200 Wh/kg) compared to lithium-ion equivalents, but continuous research and development are expected 5", "page": 4, "position": 0}

While early prototypes have shown faster degradation, some advanced Na-ion battery designs have demonstrated 4,000 cycles, rivaling Li-ion batteries.48,50 This long cycle life is particularly attractive for applications such as grid storage, where energy density is less critical than longevity and cost- effectiveness. Overall, the growing interest in Na-ion batteries stems from their potential to provide a sustainable, cost-effective, and scalable energy storage solution without the resource limitations associated with lithium. As research progresses, improvements in energy density, stability, and charge-discharge performance could make Na-ion batteries a viable alternative to Li-ion batteries for a wide range of applications, including renewable energy storage, electric vehicles, and large-scale power grids. As a result the development of Na-ion battery materials has gained significant attention in both academia and industry. Among various Na-ion cathode materials, many industries (such as HiNa, CATL, Fara- dian, Tiamat, etc) have focused on layered transition metal oxides of O3 and P2-types, as they emerged as highly promising due to their superior capacity compared to poly-anionic and Prussian blue-based cathodes.51 However, the large ionic size of Na+ slows down the kinetics and induces complex phase transitions during insertion and extraction, leading to challenges such as poor cycle stability, low energy density, and limited rate capability. To address these challenges, researchers have explored various strategies for optimizing Na-ion cathodes. In this work, we leverage a DNN model developed using the PyTorch library to design novel O3- and P2-type layered transition metal oxide compositions.

This approach helps capture the unique fingerprint of each electrode material within the dataset, enhancing the model’s ability to differentiate and predict material properties accu- rately. The statistical elemental feature will be different for a specific electrode material, and by considering all the statistical variables (like avg, min, max, and var) we have generated almost 262 features (see Figure 3) and used them as input for DNN model.

The components of a feature vector are diverse in terms of their magnitudes, which can range from small fractions to a few thousands. Therefore, all the input features were normalized for better and more efficient training of the DNN model thereby avoiding any biased preference of a particular feature with respect to others based solely on their magnitude. The normalization was performed by effectively scaling all of the inputs to be between -1 and 1, and it was carried out while training our model and it is not done for target value. The list of statical features used to develop the DNN model is provided in the Table S1 of the Supporting Information (SI). Figure 3: Workflow and DNN model architecture.

The output layer consisted of a single neuron with a linear activation function, providing the predicted value of average voltage. The performance of the ML models has been tested through different error metrics, mean absolute error (MAE) and mean square error (MSE). The MAE and MSE are defined by the following equations MAE = 1 N N X i=1 (|V DFT i −V ML i |) (1) MSE = 1 N N X i=1 (V DFT i −V ML i )2 (2) where V DFT i represents the DFT computed voltage and V ML i represents the machine learning predicted voltage, for the given ith battery sample and N total number of samples in the dataset. The MSE loss was used to quantify the prediction errors. MSE was chosen for its sensitivity to large errors, ensuring the model minimizes significant deviations in voltage predictions. The Adam optimizer58 was utilized for its efficiency and adaptive learning rate capabilities. The learning rate and weight decay were set to 0.0001 and 0.001. For training, the dataset was split into training and testing subsets, with 80% of the data allocated for training and the remainder for testing. The model was trained over 1000 epochs with a batch size of 64, balancing computational efficiency and convergence. A learning rate scheduler with StepLR was employed to dynamically adjust the learning rate, ensuring bet- ter convergence. During training, both training and validation losses were monitored to ensure the model’s performance improved without overfitting. A residual plot showed that the prediction errors were well-distributed around zero, with no significant bias observed. The network architecture was defined using PyTorch’s torch.nn.Module. The model param- eters were updated iteratively using backpropagation, and gradients were computed using PyTorch’s autograd functionality. After each epoch, the model was evaluated on the valida- tion set to monitor generalization performance.

The model’s predictions closely matched the actual values (Figure 7), highlighting its ability to learn complex relationships between input features and the target variable. Results and discussion The MSE loss during the training of the model was evaluated as shown in Figure 4(a). At the beginning of training (epochs close to 0), both training and testing losses are high, which is expected because the model starts with randomly initialized weights. It has not yet learned to map the input features to the target output effectively. In the first few epochs, both the training and testing losses drop steeply. This indicates that the model is learning rapidly and adjusting its weights effectively to minimize the error. As training progresses, the loss values for both training and testing data begin to plateau. This suggests that the model has learnt the underlying patterns in the data and is approaching convergence. The training loss and testing loss closely follow each other throughout the training process. This is a strong indicator that the model is generalizing well to unseen data and is not overfitting. At the final epochs (e.g., around 1000), both training and testing losses remain low and stable, further confirming that the model has achieved a good fit without overfitting or underfitting. The convergence of training and training losses demonstrates the model’s capability to learn and generalize effectively. The lack of significant divergence between the two curves suggests that the chosen hyperparameters (learning rate, architecture, etc.) are appropriate. The alignment of the testing loss with the training loss highlights that the model is not overly complex and has a good balance of bias and variance. Here, the R2 score and error metrics (MSE or MAE) were initially evaluated using a single train-test split. However, to ensure superior generalization and model reliability, we have also performed 10-fold cross-validation, as discussed below.

The test R2 value of 0.906 shows that the model captures most of the variance in the test data. Some scatter points deviate significantly from the ideal fit line, especially at higher actual voltage values. These deviations indicate instances where the model struggle to predict accurately. The higher MSE on the test set (0.182 vs. 0.009, Figure 4(d)) reflects that very small prediction errors could be present on unseen data, which is common in machine learning models. The model demonstrates strong learning on the training set and reasonable generalization on the test set, as evidenced by the high test R2 and close alignment of many points with the ideal fit line (y = x). Minor overfitting may exist, but the model can still make accurate predictions for the majority of the test data.

Feature Importance for Battery Voltage Prediction Figure 8 represents the feature importance analysis for voltage prediction in battery materi- als reveals that the most influential descriptors are related to the thermodynamic stability, electronic structure and redox behavior of the compounds. The top two features, stabil- ity discharge (MeV/atom) and stability charge (MeV/atom), indicate the energetic stability of the material in both charge and discharge states. These features are crucial as they reflect the material’s ability to reversibly intercalate and deintercalate ions without sig- nificant structural degradation, which directly affects the voltage profile.72 The average p valence electrons and maximum number of unfilled p orbitals (max:num p unfilled) provide insight into the electronic structure, particularly the capacity of the material to accom- modate electron transfer during redox reactions.73 The minimum energy from the Ghosh electronegativity scale74,75 (min:en ghosh) captures the material’s ability to stabilize anion- cation interactions, which is critical for determining the redox potential.76 Additionally, the standard deviation of oxidation states reflects the variability in oxidation behavior across constituent elements, influencing charge transfer dynamics.31 Features such as fraction of s valence electrons, maximum ground-state magnetic moment (max:gs mag moment), and 5-norm30 (a measure of geometric or electronic structure variability) further contribute by characterizing bonding nature, magnetic properties, and structural stability, respectively. Lastly, the average van der Waals radius (ave:vdw radius uff) highlights the role of atomic size in determining ion mobility within the material.77 These features collectively define the electrochemical performance and voltage characteristics of battery materials, aiding in the rational design of high-performance electrodes. 17", "page": 16, "position": 0}

Design of Novel Cathode Materials for Na-ion Batteries The design of new Na-ion battery cathode materials was carried out by leveraging the tem- plate crystal structures of transition metal layered oxides with the general formula NaMO2, where M represents transition or post-transition metals. These layered oxides serve as a fundamental structural framework due to their well-established electrochemical properties and stability in Na-ion battery applications. For this study, we focused on two widely stud- ied structural types of layered transition metal oxides: O3-type and P2-type materials (see Figure 9). The O3-type materials exhibit trigonal symmetry with the R −3m space group, while the P2-type materials possess hexagonal symmetry with the P63/mmc space group.

The formation energy per formula unit (eV/f.u.) has been calculated using the below formula:32,85 Ef = E(NaxM a 1 M b 2M c 3O2) −xµNa −aµM1 −bµM2 −cµM3 −µO2 (3) where a + b + c = 1 and M a 1 ,M b 2 and M c 3, represents the three different stoichiometry of metallic cations and their corresponding chemical potentials µM1, µM2, and µM3 respectively. Also, µNa and µO2 represents the chemical potential of Na bulk and O2 molecule. The voltage (V) of the newly designed compositions was calculated using the general formula86 for multi-component layered metal oxide which is V = −ENax2MO2 −ENax1MO2 −(x2 −x1)ENa x2 −x1 (4) where M is the multi-cations of different stoichiometry of M a 1 ,M b 2 and M c 3; ENa is total energy of the Na bulk and x1 and x2 are the different sodium (Na) concentration during sodiation and desodiation. A comprehensive list of the newly designed O3 and P2-type cathode materials, along with their predicted voltages (V) from our DNN model, is presented in Figure 10. The voltage predictions were obtained using our PyTorch-based DNN model, which has demon- strated superior accuracy in predicting the electrochemical performance of Na-ion cathodes. To further validate the stability and feasibility of these newly designed compositions, we performed first-principles DFT calculations. Table 3 and 4 represent the formation energy newly designed material compositions, assessing their thermodynamic stability and likeli- hood of successful synthesis.

Our deep neural network (DNN) model, trained on Density Functional The- ory (DFT) data, achieves a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.24V, outperforming exist- ing voltage prediction models with a high level of accuracy and a deviation of less than 5%. To validate the predictive capability of our model, we compared its voltage estima- tions with DFT-calculated values for two newly investigated cathode compositions: O3- Na0.67Mn0.61Ni0.28Cr0.11O2 and P2-Na0.67Mn0.5Fe0.28Cu0.22O2. The excellent agreement be- tween ML-predicted and DFT-computed voltages confirm the reliability of our approach in capturing the electrochemical behavior of Na-ion materials. By significantly reducing reliance on time-consuming and resource-intensive experimental methods, our approach pro- vides a systematic framework for identifying promising cathode materials with optimized electrochemical properties. This data-driven methodology enables rapid screening of novel compositions, guiding experimental efforts toward the most promising candidates. The insights gained from this study contribute to the development of high-performance Na-ion batteries, offering a viable and sustainable alternative to Li-ion technology for future energy storage applications. By leveraging machine learning-driven material discovery, this work paves the way for the rational design of next-generation battery materials, supporting advancements in clean energy technologies and grid-scale storage solutions.
