This improvement suggests a potential strategy for improving ionic conductivity in LiBO2 through boron vacancy generation.

Introduction Lithium metaborate (LiBO2) is an inorganic compound of lithium, boron, and oxygen, which has drawn increasing attention in both pure and applied research [1,2]. This is due chiefly to its potential applications as an advanced multi-functional material, ranging in use from nuclear reactor materials engineering to nonlinear optics [3], as well as to use in lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). This use for LIBs includes its potential applications as a solid electrolyte [4‚Äì9] as well as electrode coating materials [10‚Äì14]. Since LiBO2 belongs to a large family of boron-contained LIBs materials [15‚Äì17] that exhibit unique character- istics, establishing, for example, a stable and effective solid electrolyte ininterface (SEI), thermal stability, cost-effectiveness, and environmental friendliness [3,18‚Äì24]. Therefore, there has been a surge of interest in the mechanistic understanding of defect formation and lithium migration in these materials [3,18‚Äì24]. Studies intend to shed light on (i) how to improve these materials‚Äô ionic conductivity [21], and (ii) how to control radiation-induced modifications to LIBs [22‚Äì24]. Task (i) focuses on understanding defect chemistry of LIBs materials to engineering the materials for their enhanced lithium-ion diffusion [21]. Task (ii) is applied to those LIBs that operate in extreme environments such as in fission/fusion nuclear reactors or deep-space-exploration spacecrafts [21‚Äì24] where neutrons can trans- mute boron atoms inside LIBs materials via the boron neutron capture reaction (BNCR) 2", "page": 1, "position": 0}

In this reaction, boron vacancies are created at the original lattice sites of 10 5 B (comprising ca. 20% of B atoms), while the products of the reaction, which are energetic particles, can trigger atom displacement cascade processes in crystalline solids, resulting in neutron- induced defects. These range from zero-dimensional defects (i.e., point defects in the form of Frenkel pairs) to three-dimensional ones (volume defects in the form of voids or helium bubbles or clusters of defects) [3, 18‚Äì24]. While BNCR is beneficial to certain materials [26], neutron detection techniques [25], and cancer treatment [27], whether it is beneficial or detrimental to boron-containing LIBs working in neutron-based environ- ments is still an open question [22‚Äì24]. Thus, a deeper insight into the role of boron‚Äôs presence and absence (boron vacancy) in LIBs materials in general, and LiBO2 in partic- ular, is crucial for both designing and engineering of boron-contained electrode coatings for liquid-electrolyte LIBs or boron-contained solid electrolytes for all-solid LIBs with an optimized content of the 10B isotope. Moreover, LiBO2 is one of the components of SEI formed on the electrode surface of LIBs assembled with borate-based liquid electrolytes that have recently been subject to increasing research interest in the field of liquid elec- trolytes for LIBs [15‚Äì17]. Therefore, investigations of lithium transport in LiBO2 would also lead to a key fundamental understanding of such a borate-based SEI as well as the overall performance of borate-based LIBs. The monoclinic (m-LBO, Œ± phase) and tetragonal (t-LBO, Œ≥ phase) polymorphs are the most commonly studied polymorphs of the LiBO2 crystals (see Figure 1 and Table 1 and the detailed description in Section 2). The m-LBO crystal structure is stable at am- bient temperature and pressure. In addition, it was reported that [28] baking a hydrated LiBO2.8H2O powder at 600‚ó¶C enables it to crystallize in the ionic m-LBO polymorph. In contrast, the t-LBO polymorph was reported [28] to be stable at high pressures. One notable contrast is that while lithium ions in m-LBO form", "page": 2, "position": 0}

While theoretical studies have examined the electronic and vibrational properties of the two polymorphs [6, 7] and lithium conductivity in m-LBO [5], the impact of lattice vacancies on lithium transport remains unknown. The present work is aimed at filling this knowledge gap using density functional theory (DFT) calculations. We investigated the effects of boron and oxygen vacancies on the lattice structure, electronic properties, and lithium ion migration energy barrier Em. Our DFT results show that boron and oxygen vacancies affect lithium transport in both polymorphs differently: oxygen vacancies lower Em in m-LBO but increase it in t-LBO, while boron vacancies significantly reduce Em in both m-LBO and t-LBO, leading to enhanced diffusivity and ionic conductivity in both polymorphs. 4", "page": 3, "position": 0}

The Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) generalized-gradient approximation (GGA) was em- ployed [33]. The effects of lattice vacancies on crystal lattice structure, electronic density of states, and lithium transport were then analyzed from our first-principles calculations. Our DFT calculations were conducted using plane-wave basis sets of pseudopoten- tials (UPPs): Li.pbe-sl-rrkjus_psl.1.0.0.UPF for lithium, B.pbe-n-rrkjus_psl.1.0.0.UPF for boron, and O.pbe-n-rrkjus_psl.1.0.0.UPF for oxygen [34].

There are 16 ions per unit cell for each polymorph: 4 lithium cations (labeled Li1 to Li4), 4 boron cations (B1 to B4), and 8 oxygen anions (O1 to O8). On the one hand, the m-LBO polymorph possesses the P21/c space group, where lithium cations (Li+) are coordinated with four oxygen anions (O2‚àí) in a 4-coordinate geometry, resulting in Li+-O2‚àíbond distances ranging from 1.93 to 1.97 √Ö. Boron ions (B3+) exhibit a trigonal planar coordination with three O2‚àíanions, leading to B3+-O2‚àíbond distances spanning 1.33 to 1.41 √Ö.

To illustrate this point, we provide here an example of a previous DFT calculation of the m-LBO polymorph by Islam et al. [5], who have examined the effect of supercell size on the lithium vacancy formation energy in the m-LBO. They found that the values of the formation energy of lithium vacancy in 1 √ó 1 √ó 1 (i.e., Li4B4O8), 2 √ó 2 √ó 2 (i.e., Li32B32O64), and 3 √ó 3 √ó 3 (i.e., Li108B108O216) supercells are 663 kJ/mol (6.87 eV), 667 kJ/mol (6.91 eV), and 673 kJ/mol (6.98 eV), respectively. From these results, we estimate that our simulation supercells may suffer a ‚àº1.5% accuracy loss of the formation energy vs. a significantly more costly 3 √ó 3 √ó 3 supercell. This is a reasonable compromise for a fast screening of the many configurations that were sampled in this work as it aims primarily for a quantitative picture of physics and chemistry of the point defects and their effects on lithium transport. In addition, these supercells serve as valuable benchmark cases for preliminary investigations and provide insights into vacancy-mediated transport phenomena. They could guide subsequent studies with large systems or alternative methodologies (e.g., classical molecular dynamics modeling of cas- cade atomic displacement induced with neutron irradiation) to achieve a comprehensive understanding of defect behavior in lithium-containing materials. Moreover, these super- cells are advantageous for capturing the physics and chemistry of interactive point defects or their clusters induced by extremely-high-dose radiation such as plasma facing mater- ials in nuclear fusion reactors, shedding light on the material‚Äôs response under extreme conditions. The procedure of our DFT calculations is described briefly as follows [29]. Firstly, we started our calculations with the pristine nondefective supercells for each polymorph.

Secondly, each of defective supercells were created by generating a vacancy at a Li, B, or O site in the crystal lattice of the fully-relaxed nondefective supercells. For the m-LBO polymorph, one of Li1, B1, or O1 (see Fig. 1a and Table 1) was respectively removed to form Li-vacancy, B-vacancy, or O-vacancy supercells. For the t-LBO, to create these defective supercells, Li1, B3, or O5 (see Fig. 1b and Table 1) was respectively removed. The defective supercells were then fully relaxed to optimize their geometry in the same fashion as those for the nondefective supercells. Thirdly, the analysis of the effects of the vacancies was performed. The lattice para- meters and the volume of each of the supercells were obtained, from which the percentages of the volume change relative to the nondefective supercells were determined.

The CI-NEB images undergo internal relaxation until the maximum residual force reaches a threshold of less than 0.01 eV/√Ö, without altering the volume or cell parameters during optimization. We studied lithium diffusion via the vacancy-mediated mechanism, by which lithium ion randomly hops back and forth between its initial lattice site and a final lithium vacancy site [21,30]. There are 6 pathways, labeled Path 1 to Path 6 (as shown in Figure 2), which were searched for the optimal lithium diffusion pathway in the supercells (with and without B or O vacancy) of the m-LBO polymorph. In contrast, 9 pathways, labeled Path 1 to Path 9 (shown in Figure 3), were examined for the supercells of the t-LBO polymorph. These pathways were also investigated in defective supercells. To compare lithium transport in both m-LBO and t-LBO polymorphs and the effects of O or B vacancy on the transport, the values of the diffusivity of lithium ion along the fastest pathways were determined as D = D0 exp \u0012 ‚àíEm kBT \u0013 , (3) where Em is the migration energy barrier of the fastest pathway for each of the studied supercells, kB is the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature, D0 ‚âàa2ŒΩ, where a is the hopping distance of lithium ion from its initial site to its final vacancy site, and ŒΩ is the lithium hopping frequency.

They have also attempted to examine both medium (i.e., 2 √ó 2 √ó 2) and large (i.e., 3 √ó 3 √ó 3) supercells. Yet, they only improved the accuracy of the formation energy by respectively 0.6% and 1.5% relative to the 1 √ó 1 √ó 1 supercell. Their work did not explore, however, the formation energies of boron and oxygen vacancies in the m-LBO or t-LBO polymorphs. Therefore, we provide here a comprehensive comparison of the formation energy of each of atomic lattice vacancies in the LiBO2 material by conducting our ab initio studies for both of the polymorphs in the same setups of our DFT calculations described in detail in Section 2. Again, to minimize our computational cost, we only employed small (i.e., 1 √ó 1 √ó 1) supercells. The results are presented in Table 2. It is worth noting from Table 2 that, the value of the formation energy of lithium vacancy in the m-LBO polymorph (Œ± phase) is 5.03 eV (485.32 kJ/mol), which is 1.84 eV (177.53 kJ/mol) less than that calculated by Islam et al.. This difference is attributed to the different DFT methods and codes used in this work and by Islam et al.

Thirdly, the formation energy of vacancies consistently increases from lithium vacancies to oxygen and to boron ones. While the values of the formation energies of lithium and oxygen vacancies in both the polymorphs are considerably high, those of boron vacancies are extremely high, implying that the generation of boron vacancies in the LiBO2 material is energetically costly and unfavorable. However, if the LiBO2 material is subject to a high dose neutron irradiation, a high concentration of boron vacancies therefore might be possibly achievable in the structure domains of clusters of strongly-interactive vacancies. 3.2 Effects of Lattice Vacancy on Lattice Structures of LiBO2 Crystals This subsection presents the results of our ab initio studies of the effects of vacancies in LiBO2 polymorphs on the crystal lattice and the energy of formation per atom.

Our data of the lattice parameters of the LiBO2 polymorphs were obtained after the supercell of each polymorph was fully relaxed using our PBEGGA-UPP setup in the QE code from the initial inputs shown in Table 1.

Table 4 provides the effect of vacancies on the lattice parameters and the volumes of the conventional unit cells in the crystal polymorphs.

As a result, the volumes of the unit cells of the defective supercells were increased or decreased by 1.5% to 9.8% relative to those of the corresponding nondefective perfect supercells after their geometry optimization. Specifically, the effects of the lattice vacancies on the crystal structure of each polymorph are separately detailed as follows. For the m-LBO polymorph, the tendency of the effect of each type of vacancies on lattice parameters are consistent: lattice vacancies result in the decreased values of both a and b, but increased value of c. Nevertheless, the overall impact of vacancies on the volume of the unit cell are different: boron vacancies cause the crystal to expand by 1.5% while lithium and oxygen vacancies shrink the crystal by 2.3% and 3.6%, respectively. Yet, the change of the volume of the unit cell of the m-LBO polymorph is still less then 5%. Notably, the effect of boron and oxygen vacancies on the crystal lattice of t-LBO polymorph is more pronounced, but in opposite direction: nearly 10% of volume changes in both oxygen-vacancy (‚àí8.4%) and boron-vacancy (+9.8%) unit cells relative to the perfect unit cell, which is quite remarkable. Finally, while the tendency of lithium vacancies to decrease a and b and to increase c in both polymorphs are similar, lithium vacancies shrink the volume (‚àí2.3%) of the m-LBO crystal, but expand that (+0.3%) of the t-LBO one.

[6] reported that Eg = 7.6 eV and 10.4 eV were obtained for m-LBO and t-LBO, respectively. Note that another work of the same authors [5], reported that a PWGGA-PAW method implemented in VASP code yielded a lower value of Eg = 5.74 eV for the m-LBO polymorph, and that the defect energy levels of the lithium vacancy oc- curred in the band gap and located adjacent to the top of the valence band, implying that the vacancy is capable of acting as an acceptor of electrons to become negatively charged and the lithium-vacancy m-LBO crystal in this case behaves like a (wide-band-gap) p-type semiconductor. However, there have not been any DFT calculations of electronic band structures and density of states (DOS) published for other types of lattice vacancies (i.e., 18", "page": 17, "position": 0}

The results of our DOS calculations for the perfect (i.e., nondefective) and defective crystals of LiBO2 material are presented in Figures 4 (m-LBO polymorph) and 5 (t-LBO polymorph). Furthermore, panels 4a and 5a show that the values of the band gap for the respective perfect crystals are Eg = 5.23 eV (m-LBO) and Eg = 7.44 eV (t-LBO). While these values are less than those reported by Basalaev et al. [6] (discussed in the previous paragraph), our results also show that the perfect t-LBO polymorph possesses a wider band gap than that of its perfect m-LBO counterpart. The smaller values of Eg of our DFT calculations are due to the nature of the GGA method which usually underestimates the band gap. Basalaev et al. [6] used a hybrid B3LYP method which is better at estimating the band gap, but computationally much more costly (which becomes prohibitive given the number of configurations probed in this study). From Figures 4 and 5, the effect of each of the vacancies on DOS in the m-LBO and t-LBO polymorphs is different. Compared to the perfect m-LBO crystal, the DOS of the Li-vacancy m-LBO crystal (panel 4b) shows the energy levels of lithium defects in the band gap, which is just above and well separated (about 0.8 eV) from the top of the valence band, which behave like acceptor levels. These levels are localized to manifest a sharp peak (rather than a continuous energy band) centered at the acceptor level which is 4.35 eV from the botom of the conduction band.

As a result, the band gap is effectively the same as that of the perfect crystal (i.e, Eg = 7.44 eV), suggesting that the electronic insulation capability of the t-LBO polymorph might not be deteriorated with the presence of lithium vacancies. The DOS of the boron-vacancy crystals in both polymorphs (panels 4d and 5d) mani- fests a similar scenario to that of lithium-vacancy crystals, where boron defect energies levels occur in the band gap, close to and separate from the top of the valence band (panel 4d) for the m-LBO polymorph. These defect levels merge altogether with the valence band (panel 5d) in the t-LBO polymorph. Unlike the lithium-vacancy crystals, the defect energy levels of boron vacancies are broadened to exhibit an overlapping band of the localized levels spanning over approximately a width of 1.0 eV for both polymorphs. For the m-LBO polymorph (panel 4d) the lowest level of the boron‚Äôs defect energy levels is nearly 0.4 eV above the top of the valence band while the highest level is about 4.18 eV below the bottom of the conduction band. Consequently, the boron vacancies behave like electron acceptors, leading to a reduced effective band gap of Eg = 4.18 eV, lower than that of the Li-vacancy crystal (Eg = 4.35 eV) as seen in panel 4b. This means that boron vacancies reduce the capability of electron insulation of the m-LBO polymorph more than lithium vacancies. In the t-LBO polymorph, the band of the defect levels of boron vacan- cies merge with the top of the valence band and the band gap gets narrower (Eg = 6.44 eV compared to Eg = 7.44 eV). Similar to the m-LBO polymorph, boron vacancies also tend to degrade the capability of electronic insulation of the t-LBO polymorph. The effects of oxygen vacancies on DOS (panels 4c and 5c) are fairly different in the two polymorphs.

In terms of the reduction of the band gap, oxygen vacancies tend to degrade the electronic insulation capability of the m-LBO polymorph even more than boron vacancies. On the other hand, in the t-LBO polymorph (panel 5c), the defect energy levels of oxygen vacancies exhibit only one continuous band, which is 0.7 eV separated from the top of the valence band, suggesting that oxygen vacancies behave like electron acceptors in a p-type semiconductor. The defect energy band spans in the band gap toward high energies and makes the band gap shrunk to have a narrower band gap of Eg = 4.44 eV, also giving rise to a worsened electronic insulation capability of the t-LBO polymorph. 3.3.2 Lithium-ion Transport This subsection presents our ab initio studies on the effect of lattice vacancies on lithium transport in the two polymorphs of the LiBO2 material. These studies constitute the primary focus of our current work. As aforementioned in Section 2 and recalled here, a certain number of migration pathways (see Figure 2 and Figure 3) of lithium ion in each of the studied supercells (either a nondefective or a defective crystal of both the polymorphs of the LiBO2 material) were investigated in order to search for the fastest pathway that possesses the smallest value of the migration energy barrier, Em. We ex- amined the vacancy-mediated diffusion mechanism, where a lithium ion migrates from its initial position to a neighboring lithium lattice vacancy. Simultaneously, the vacancy moves in the opposite direction by swapping its site with the lithium ion. The lithium ion may occupy intermediate sites of varying stability, such as interstitial sites positioned midway during its migration towards the final lithium vacancy site. These intermediate sites will feature mostly higher energies compared to the initial site resulting in significant energy barriers. The overall rate of the forward hopping for each specific pathway may be estimated by the Arrhenius-type exponential factor exp[‚àíEf m/kBT], as depicted in Eq. (3) for", "page": 20, "position": 0}

Conclusions The m-LBO and t-LBO polymorphs of LiBO2 (m-LBO and t-LBO) have been extens- ively studied for their diverse technological applications, including as solid electrolytes, solid electrolyte interphase components, and electrode coatings in lithium-ion batteries. Although experimental comparisons of lithium transport in these polymorphs have been made, focusing on their distinct two-dimensional and three-dimensional lithium networks, the mechanistic understanding of point defects, particularly lattice vacancies, on lithium transport remains incomplete. The primary goal of the current work is to investigate the formation of lithium, boron, and oxygen vacancies at concentrations ‚àº8.0 √ó 1021 cm‚àí3 and analyzed the resulting modifications in lattice structure, electronic density of states, and lithium migration en- ergy barriers in both polymorphs, focusing on the impact of lattice vacancies on Li-ion transport. Our findings indicate that boron and oxygen vacancies reduce the band gap (Eg) of LiBO2 crystals by introducing defect levels within the band gap, rendering the material a degenerate semiconductor with a large band gap. In addition, the formation energy of lattice vacancies increase from lithium vacancies, to oxygen and then boron ones. Regarding lithium ion transport, our DFT results show that oxygen vacancies decrease the migration energy barrier (Em) in m-LBO but increase it in t-LBO. Conversely, boron vacancies significantly reduce Em in both m-LBO and t-LBO, enhancing diffusivity and ionic conductivity in both polymorphs. This suggests that generating boron vacancies could be a viable strategy for improving ionic conductivity in LiBO2. Further theoretical calculations with larger systems and experimental validation are required to explore this approach fully.

Appendix: Investigated Pathways of Li-ion Migration in LiBO2 Material This appendix presents in detail the energy landscapes of Li-ion migrations pathways other than the fastest pathways in both the polymorphs of the LiBO2 discussed in Sec. 3.3.2. We recall that in order to examine how the local lattice structure at the oxygen or boron vacancies affect the migration of lithium ion, we chose to investigate various pathways near the vacancy sites of our interest (B1 or O1 site for the m-LBO polymorph as labeled in Figure 1a, and B3 or O5 site for the t-LBO polymorph as in Figure 1b). Here, 6 migration pathways (Figure 2) and 9 pathways (Figure 3) were selected for our search for the optimal migration pathway in each of the examined crystals. The results of the energy landscapes of our CI-NEB calculations for these pathways are depicted in Figures 8 and 9. Figure 8 presents the migration energy landscapes for the 6 pathways (Figure 2) of our interest for crystals without (panel 8a) and with boron (panel 8b) or oxygen (panel 26", "page": 25, "position": 0}

These pathways are within the two-dimensional network that includes all of the 4 lithium ions per unit cell of the m-LBO polymorph. As one can see Path 3 is the most prohibitive migration pathway in the m-LBO polymorph under consideration in our current work. For example, for the crystal without boron or oxygen vacancies (panel 8a), on hopping forward from the lithium site Li1 to the lithium vacant site ‚ñ°Li4, a lithium ion take two consecutive jumps: the first one is from site Li1 to a less stable interstitial site (about 4 eV higher in energy) requiring the overcoming of an extremely high energy barrier of 12 eV, this intermediate site serves as the \"step stone\" for the lithium ion to make the second jump to ‚ñ°Li4 but overcoming a lower barrier of 3.5 eV, thus the forward migration energy of Path 3 is Ef m = 12 eV. Along Path 3, the lithium vacancy hops backward from site ‚ñ°Li4 to site Li1 and encounters two energy barriers, namely, 7.5 eV and 8.0 eV, resulting in a backward migration energy barrier of Eb m = 8.0 eV. Interestingly, both boron and oxygen vacancies modify this \"two-stop\" migration path- way to \"one-stop\" pathways with substantially reduced energy barriers, approximately three times reduction for boron vacancies (4.5 eV vs. 12 eV) as seen in Figure 8b and two times by oxygen vacancies (5.6 eV vs. 12 eV) as shown in Figure 8c. Thus, the vacancies are capable of facilitating the Li-ion migration along Path 3 substantially.

These energies are lowered by the presence of oxygen vacancies (Figure 8c) and more substantially by the formation of boron vacancies (Figure 8b). Figure 9 presents the results of our CI-NEB calculations for 9 lithium migration path- ways (see also Figure 3) in the t-LBO polymorph considered to search for the optimal ones. In contrast to the m-LBO polymorph, lithium ions in the t-LBO crystals create a three-dimensional network. For the crystal without boron or oxygen vacancies (Fig- ure 9a), there are \"nonstop\" and \"multiple-stop\" migration pathways of lithium ions. \"nonstop\" pathways refer to those along which the lithium ion only overcomes a single energy barrier to hop from the initial lithium site to the final lithium vacancy site. These pathways are Path 2, Path 4, Path 6, Path 7, and Path 8 in Figure 9a. \"Multiple-stop\" pathways are those along which one or more \"stop(s)\" (i.e., interstitial site(s)) serve(s) as the \"step stone(s)\" for the lithium ion to make its way from its departure site (i.e., the initial lithium site) to its destination", "page": 27, "position": 0}

As shown in Figure 9a, \"multiple-stop\" pathways are Path 1, Path 3, Path 5 and Path 9. The migration of lithium ion in the t-LBO polymorph is detailed as follows. Path 1, which is the most energetically costly pathway, possesses 3 intermediate stops and the destination site with the energies roughly 5.75 eV, 5.25 eV, 5.75 eV, and 0.0 eV higher than the energy of the departure site. The energy barriers that the lithium ion overcomes to take intermediate jumps are approximately 6.15 eV, 1.0 eV, 0.75 eV, 0.2 eV, resulting in Ef m = 6.5 eV. The presence of boron vacancies causes Path 1 to be modified remarkably (Figure 9b): (1) the energetic landscape of Path 1 changes from asymmetric to symmetric; (2) the number of stops is reduced from 3 to 1; and (3) the value of Ef m is reduced from Ef m = 6.5 eV to Ef m = 2.34 eV. In contrast, oxygen vacancies (Figure 9c) 28", "page": 27, "position": 1}

Path 3 in the crystal without boron or oxygen vacancies (Figure 9a) is a symmetric one-stop migration pathway along which lithium ion takes the first jump over an energy barrier of 6.2 eV on hopping forwards from its lithium initial site to an intermediate interstitial site (one stop) 6.66 eV higher in energy that the initial site, and then the second jump over a lower energy barrier of 0.5 eV from the intermediate site to the final lithium vacancy site, resulting in the migration energy barrier Ef m = 6.2 eV. The landscape of Path 3 has not been changed in the crystal with oxygen vacancies (Figure 9c), its migration barrier is higher (Ef m = 6.66 eV) than that of the crystal without boron or oxygen vacancies. However, the symmetry of Path 3 is broken in the boron-vacancy crystal (See Figure 9b), the lithium ion has to jump over an energy barrier as high as 2.5 eV to an interstitial site of almost the same energy as the initial site, and then takes another jump over a lower barrier of 1.7 eV to its final site which is located at a lower energy (about 0.5 eV lower) than the initial site, leading to Ef m = 2.5 eV. Apparently, boron vacancies facilitate lithium transport along Path 3 while oxygen vacancies inhibit it. Path 5 also possesses a symmetric and multiple-stop (3 intermediate stops) landscape. This landscape is somewhat broken with the presence of oxygen vacancies. The value of Ef m is a bit lower (Ef m = 5.1 eV) in the oxygen-vacancy crystal (Figure 9c) than that (Ef m = 5.5 eV) in the crystal without boron or oxygen vacancies (Figure 9a). However, while Path 5 is still symmetric, the number of stops along the pathway is reduced from 3 to 1. Remarkably, boron vacancies reduce the value of Ef m more than four times, from Ef m = 5.5 eV", "page": 28, "position": 0}

Conversely, Path 9 is modified dramatically with the presence of boron vacancies in the t-LBO. The energetic landscape of the migration pathway becomes an asymmetric two-stop one, energy at any point along the pathway is substantially reduced below 2.5 eV. The description of the migration pathway is specified as follows. On hopping forward along Path 9 in the crystal with boron vacancies, lithium ion takes its first jump from the initial lithium site to an interstitial site (the first stop) at an energy level of 1 eV relative to the initial site and needs to overcome an energy barrier of approximately 2.1 eV. Next, it jumps from the first interstitial site to the second one with the same energy level as the initial site. On this jump, it needs to overcome another energy barrier of 1.5 eV. Finally, it takes the last jump from the second interstitial site to the final lithium vacant site at the energy level that is 0.4 eV lower than the initial site. The energy barrier to overcome for the last jump is approximately 0.75 eV. Overall, the migration energy of lithium ion along Path 9 in the t-LBO crystal with boron vacancies is Ef m = 6.0 eV, which is lower than that of the crystal without boron or oxygen vacancies and that of the crystal with oxygen vacancies. Finally, it is worth noting that boron vacancies facilitate lithium transport along Path 9 while the transport is inhibited by oxygen vacancies. In the t-LBO polymorph, the energy landscapes of Path 2 and Path 4 and those of Path 6 and Path 7, which are nonstop migration pathways of lithium ion, are respectively the same as shown in Figure 9a. They are symmetric. However, they are apparently modified with the presence of", "page": 29, "position": 0}
