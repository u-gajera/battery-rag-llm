It is well-known that the surface orientation of a Zn metal anode is vital to the reversibility of a Zn metal battery. Herein, the (101)-oriented thin Zn metal anode (down to 2 μm) is electrodeposited on a Cu surface by adding dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) electrolyte additive in ZnSO4 aqueous solution. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) observation indicates the formation of flat terrace-like compact (101)-oriented surfaces. Insitu optical observation confirms that the (101)-oriented surfaces can be reversibly plated and stripped. DFT calculations reveal two mechanisms for the nucleation and growth of the Zn-(101) surface: (1) formation of Zn(101)//Cu(001) could lower the interface energy as compared to Zn(002)//Cu(001); (2) large reconstruction of the Zn (101) surface with DMSO and H2O absorption. Raman, XPS, and ToF-SIMS characterizations indicate that adding DMSO in ZnCl2 could facilitate the formation of ZnO-based SEI on Zn metal surface, while OH- and S-based SEI can be obtained with DMSO in ZnSO4. The electrochemical testings are performed, which demonstrates a higher cyclability for the (101)-oriented Zn in the half cell as well as a lower charge transfer barrier with respect to the (002)-dominated surface of the same electrode thickness. Zn||V2O5 full cells are further assembled, showing better capacity retention for the (101)-Zn as compared to the (002)-Zn with the same thickness (5 μm, 3 μm, and 2 μm). We hope this study to spur further interest in the control of Zn metal surface crystallographic orientation towards ultrathin Zn metal anodes. 1. Introduction Zn-ion batteries with low cost, high safety, high volumetric capacity, and low toxicity have been regarded as one of the most promising alternative energy storage technologies for applications in renewable energy storage and grid storage[1]. They can use nonflammable aqueous electrolytes, which could effectively avoid serious safety issues such as fire and explosion. Moreover, unlike chemically active lithium metal, Zn metal is more stable and easier to store, transport, and recycle, making it an ideal anode for a Zn-ion battery. However, one challenge that hinders the commercialization", "page": 1, "position": 0}

Numerous methods have been applied to increase the (002) surface ratio of the Zn metal anode, including substrate regulation[6], electrolyte engineering (with additives[7] or gel-electrolytes[8]), and surface protective-layer coating[9]. Meanwhile, so far, the (101)-oriented surface of a Zn metal anode is less well understood. Investigating the (101)-oriented Zn metal surface could enable a comprehensive understanding of the thermodynamics and kinetics of the electrodeposition process, in particular, the competition between the nucleation and growth of the (002)-oriented and (101)-oriented surfaces during electrodeposition and their impact on dendrite growth[10]. One intriguing question to ask: can we engineer (101)-oriented Zn metal anode for a stable Zn metal battery? Electrodeposition is a facile synthesis technique to obtain metal anodes, where thin metal atoms are deposited on an electrode by applying an electric current through an electrochemical cell. The surface orientation of the metal anodes can be engineered by tuning the electrodeposition parameters[11] (e.g., deposition current density, deposition time, electrolyte composition, etc.). For instance, it is demonstrated that a (110) surface-dominated lithium metal anode can be obtained by increasing the electroplating capacity, which displays fast deposition/stripping kinetics and excellent reversibility in a battery [10, 12]. In another example, it is shown that the crystallographic orientation of Zn deposits is significantly affected by the cation structures and related physicochemical properties of the ionic liquid electrolytes [13]. Moreover, by adding a small amount of electrolyte additives, the surface composition (e.g. solid electrolyte interface, SEI) and surface orientation of the electrodeposited Li and Zn metals can be altered. In particular, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) with a large Guttman donor number has been widely employed as electrolyte additives in lithium-metal and lithium-air batteries, which could modify the solvation structure and composition. Recently, Cao et al. demonstrated that by adding DMSO to the ZnCl2 aqueous electrolyte, a protective SEI formed as a result of the change in the solvation shell, yielding high reversibility for the Zn metal battery[7a].", "page": 2, "position": 0}

Without additive, the (002)-surface dominates in the electrodeposited Zn metal anode, with regional loose hexagonal crystals; while with 5% DMSO added in the 2 M ZnSO4 solution, the (101)-surface is more favorable, forming a compact surface with parallel habit crystal planes. Contradictory to popular belief, electrochemical testings indicate that the (101)-oriented Zn metal exhibits superior reversibility with small polarization in a symmetrical battery. While the full battery is further assembled with thin electrodeposited Zn metal anode (2 μm, 3 μm, and 5 μm), commercially available V2O5 cathodes, and 2 M Zn(OTf)2 electrolyte, which shows a maximum specific capacity of 359 mAh/g, and 170 mAh/g after 300 cycles, that is comparable to the commercially available 20 μm Zn metal foil. We hope this study could spur further interest in the orientation-dependent of the electrochemical performance of metal anodes. 2. Results and Discussion Surface morphological and structural characterization. Field-emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM) is employed to characterize the surface morphology of the as-deposited Zn metal (denoted by D-Zn) surface (Figure 1). The planar view SEM image of the as-deposited Zn metal surface without DMSO can be observed in Figure 1(a), showing disordered sub-micron flake-like crystal planes. Meanwhile, with the addition of DMSO in the electrolyte (2.5%, 5%, and 7.5% in vol%, Figure 1b-1d), the D-Zn metal surface is occupied with mainly well-ordered compact crystal stacks, forming terrace-like surface structures. Among them, with a 5 % volume fraction of DMSO in the electrolyte, the D-Zn metal surface demonstrates minimum surface unevenness (Figure 1c). The cross-section views of the SEM and EDS images for D-Zn anode (deposited with 5 % DMSO in an aqueous electrolyte) are shown in Figure 1(e), which indicates the formation of a uniform interface with an average of ~6.0 μm thick Zn metal on top of a 20 μm Cu substrate. The low magnification cross-section view of the electrodeposited layer is further given in Figure S1, confirming the uniformity of the deposited Zn metal anode. It should be noted here that the deviation with the theoretical deposition thickness", "page": 3, "position": 0}

This indicates that the dense surface shown in Figure 1(c) is mainly (101)-oriented, in good agreement with the tilting of the crystal plane with respect to the xy surface.

(f) XRD of the above electrodes and the peak intensity ratio of the Zn I(101)/I(002). As a comparison, the surface morphology for the electrodeposited Zn metal with other aqueous electrolytes is given in Figure S2. It can be observed that an island-like loose surface formed with 1.3 M ZnCl2 as the deposition electrolyte (Figure S2a). Whereas the addition of an 18.75% volume fraction of DMSO could lead to the formation of more compact surfaces, with the tilting of (101)-oriented surfaces (Figure S2b). Meanwhile, using 2M Zn(OTf)2 electrolyte, the surface morphology is flatter as compared to ZnCl2 , as shown in Figure S2(c). While adding a 5 % volume fraction of DMSO leads to the growth of a grain-like structure. It can be concluded that the electrodeposits show worse morphology with ZnCl2 electrolytes as compared to ZnSO4 and Zn(OTf)2 electrolytes. To further investigate the stability of the Zn metal surface in the electrolytes, the Zn metal anodes were soaked into the 2M Zn(OTf)2 electrolyte for a week. XRD and SEM", "page": 4, "position": 0}

XRD measurements reveal no obvious side reaction for the (101) dominated D-Zn. However, for the commercial Zn metal foil, multiple side peaks are significantly enhanced, corresponding to ZnxOyTf(OH)2x-y·nH2O[14]. This is also confirmed by the SEM image, where a terrace-like compact surface can be found for the D-Zn, showing no essential change in the surface morphology after the soak. Whereas for the C-Zn, disordered sub-micron flake-like crystal planes can be discovered after the soak. This shows that the side reactions can occur on the commercialized Zn foil surface, while they are effectively inhibited for the electrodeposited (101)-surface. In-situ optical observation. In-situ optical observation of the electrodeposition and stripping processes is further given in Figure 2 to study the dynamic plating and striping behavior of the Zn metal on the Cu surface with different electrolytes (e.g., 1.3 M of ZnCl2, 1.3 M ZnCl2 with 18.75% DMSO, 2 M ZnSO4, and 2 M ZnSO4 with 5% DMSO). To slow down the processes for better observation and comparison, the plating and stripping processes were under a relatively low current density of 21 mA cm-2. The bare Cu surface is bronze with unidirectional processing scratches under the optical microscope (0.0 s). After electrodeposition for 2.5 s, part of the surface is covered with green mossy Zn metal for all four cases. Interestingly, it can be seen that with a ZnCl2-based electrolyte, the green mossy region is dispersed on the entire electrode surface; whereas with the ZnSO4 electrolyte, the Zn metal tends to nucleate and grow locally. It is also shown that for both ZnCl2 and ZnSO4, adding DMSO leads to a more uniform surface. Consequently, with a longer electrodeposition time (e.g., 100 s), the aggregation of Zn metal can be observed for the cases without DMSO addition. Meanwhile, as a comparison, with DMSO as additives, the Zn aggregation is less severe for both cases. For the electrodeposition using the ZnSO4 electrolyte with DMSO addition, after plating for 100 s, the surface is much flatter than all the other three cases, confirming the previous SEM observation with", "page": 5, "position": 0}

For the stripping process, it is discovered that the Zn metal can be reversibly stripped from the electrode for all four cases after 200 s. Interestingly, as shown in the dotted box, severe pitting corrosion can be observed for the Cu metal surface with pure ZnCl2 electrolyte at the stripping stage, while the addition of DMSO could, to some extent, reduce the Cu surface corrosion.

To better understand the thermodynamics of the surface/interface formation, the surface and interface energies were calculated using Density Functional Theory (DFT, details in methods). As shown in Table 1, the Zn (002) surface has much lower surface energy (0.016 eV/Å2) as compared to the Zn (101) surface (0.037 eV/Å2), consistent with previous literature[17]. The Cu (111) surface shows slightly lower surface energy as compared to the Cu (001) surface. The four interfacial energies for the Zn//Cu interfaces, namely Zn(002)//Cu(001), Zn(101)//Cu(001), Zn(002)//Cu(111), Zn(101)//Cu(111), are further calculated,. It is shown that the Zn(101)//Cu(001) interface shows a lower energy (0.024 eV/A2) as compared to the Zn(002)//Cu(001) interface (0.032 eV/A2); whereas the Zn(101)//Cu(111) demonstrates 4 times higher energy with respect to the Zn(002)//Cu(111). The effect of DMSO addition on the surface population is further investigated through the calculation of the adsorption of DMSO on the two Zn surfaces, as shown in Figure 3.

While the magnified view of the DMSO//Zn (101) and DMSO//Zn (001) surfaces are shown in Figure 3(c)-3(d), respectively. Large surface reconstruction is demonstrated for a Zn (101) surface, while the Zn (002) surface is very stable with the presence of surface DMSO. As shown in Table 2, a huge energy reduction (adsorption energy) for the Zn (101) surface can be seen with DMSO (-1.077 eV) as compared to a Zn (002) surface (-0.122 eV). Meanwhile, it is also interesting to note that with pure water on the Zn surface, the adsorption energy is much lower for the Zn (101) surface (-1.157 eV) with respect to the Zn (002) surface, suggesting that water can also leads to the reconstruction of the Zn (101) surface. Moreover, the DMSO+H2O on a Zn (101) surface shows much lower adsorption energy (-1.692 eV), indicating the synergic effects of DMSO and water on the Zn (101) surface reconstruction. This study demonstrates that while Zn (002) surface is thermodynamically more stable as compared to the Zn (101) surface, there are two main mechanisms likely responsible for the formation of highly (101)-oriented Zn crystals: (1) When growing on the Cu surface, it has lower interfacial energy with the Cu (111) surface, which could be a preference sites for the nucleation of the Zn (101) surface. Engineering the Cu surface orientation could be an effective method to tune the Zn (002)/ Zn (101) ratio. (2) The inherently unstable characteristic of the Zn (101) surface, which reconstruct with the surface adsorbates (H2O, DMSO), could lead to a higher energy reduction of the system, providing another avenue for the nucleation and growth of the (101) surface, which could explain the increase of (101) plane ratio with the addition of DMSO in the electrolytes as well as the increasing of (101) plane ratio during cycling for the (001)-dominated C-Zn samples (Figure S4).

After understanding the surface morphology and dynamic evolution during electrodeposition, the surface composition (e.g., possible surface SEI composition) is investigated using Raman, XPS, and ToF-SIMS. As shown in Figure 4(a), the Raman spectra for the four as-deposited Zn metal anode indicates that adding DMSO in ZnCl2 could facilitate the formation of ZnO, which exhibits a significant increment of the modes with a Raman shift between 500 cm-1 to 600 cm-1, corresponding to the E2 and A1 (LO) mode[15]. Meanwhile, no apparent peaks can be observed between 200 cm-1 to 1100 cm -1 for the three other cases, especially in the case of adding DMSO in ZnSO4. This is further confirmed by the XPS characterization (Figure 4b). The peak at ~530.5 eV is attributed to the Zn-O bond[16]. It can be observed that adding DMSO to the ZnSO4 electrolyte could reduce the tendency to form a Zn-O bond, as compared to the case with pure ZnSO4 electrolyte. After Argon etching for 120 s, the Zn- O bonding fraction increases to 50 % with pure ZnSO4 electrolyte, while with DMSO addition, the Zn-O bonding fraction only has 28 %. Meanwhile, an opposite trend can be discovered with the ZnCl2 electrolyte, where adding DMSO could facilitate the Zn-O bonding. To further characterize the possible surface SEI composition, time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) was performed. As shown in Figure 4(c), three main surface species can be identified, namely O2-, OH-, and S2-. The obvious enhancement in the S-based components can be observed with ZnSO4- based electrolytes as compared to the ZnCl2-based electrolytes. Meanwhile, notably, with the addition of DMSO in a ZnSO4 electrolyte, the O and S peak intensity decreases, showing that adding DMSO reduces the amount of OH- and S2- in the SEI of a Zn metal anode. In a short conclusion, from the three measurements of the as-deposited Zn metal, adding DMSO in ZnCl2 could facilitate the formation of ZnO-based SEI on the metal surface, while OH- and S-based SEI can be obtained with DMSO in ZnSO4. These surface SEI components could protect the Zn metal", "page": 9, "position": 0}

In particular, the contact angle for D-Zn and ZnSO4 with DMSO exhibits the lowest contact angle of ~68°. The smaller contact angle for D-Zn anodes with the ZnSO4 containing DMSO and Zn(OTf)2 electrolytes indicates that they have better wettability with the Zn surface, which could lower the nucleation barrier for the Zn electrodeposition during the cycling process. This study suggests that DMSO could be an effective electrolyte additive for ZnSO4-based and ZnCl2-based electrolytes. Meanwhile, an increase in the contact angle from 84° to 90° is observed for C-Zn anode with DMSO addition in Zn(OTf)2 electrolyte. Moreover, an even larger increase of the contact angle is shown for D-Zn anode with DMSO addition in Zn(OTf)2 electrolyte (from 78° to 108°).

The contact between the current collector and the deposition layer as well as the surface condition was further studied by the electrochemical impedance spectrum. For a C-Zn||C-Zn cell, one semi ellipse can be found in the spectrum (Figure 6b) and the resistance is 601 Ω cm-2 because no ascensional current collector was used. While two semi ellipses appear for the D-Zn||C-Zn cells. The first semi ellipse that appears in high frequency (> 1000 Hz) represents the charge transfer impedance of the electrodeposition interface and the second one in lower frequency is the electrode surface. For both surfaces, the (101) D-Zn shows smaller charge transfer resistance (Rei = 44 Ω cm-2, Rsf = 283 Ω cm-2) as compared to the (002) D- Zn (Rei = 53 Ω cm-2, Rsf = 371 Ω cm-2), suggesting that the (101) D-Zn electrode has better electron connection and ion transfer in the two interfaces. To assess the nucleation barrier on the surface during the cycling, a 10 mA cm-2 current was used for the galvanostatic test. As shown in Figure 6(c), the voltage of the (101) D-Zn reached the plateau quickly, and all these three electrodes reached the typical Zn metal growth stage in 200 s. The overpotential of the (101) D-Zn is 75 mV, which is smaller than the (002) D-Zn (86 mV) and commercial zinc foil (95 mV).

SEM observation indicates the formation of a flat terrace-like compact surface for the (101)-oriented surface. Insitu optical observation confirms the electrodeposition of a compact surface with the addition of DMSO, which can be reversibly stripped. Meanwhile, surface corrosion on the Cu metal current collector surface is observed with the ZnCl2 electrolyte. DFT calculations indicate that although the Zn (101) surface has higher surface energy, a large reconstruction is observed for the Zn (101) surface with DMSO and H2O absorption, which could largely lower the Zn (101) surface energy and nucleation barrier for the Zn (101) surface.

In this study, all DFT calculations were conducted via open-source GPAW software[21], using the projector-augmented wave (PAW)[22] method in a finite-difference (FD) way. We use the PBE exchange-correlation functional[23] and Monkhorst-Pack scheme for the surface, interface, and adsorption calculations. For surface calculations, the 4-layer (002) Zn slab, (101) Zn slab, (001) Cu slab, and (111) Cu slab were built with 96 atoms, 48 atoms, 80 atoms, and 64 atoms. The k- points meshes were respectively chosen as 1×3×1, 2×3×1, 1×3×1, and 1×3×1. As for interface calculations, all interfaces were constructed by 4-layer Zn slab and 4-layer Cu slab with less than 10% mismatch. In details, the interfaces area and k-point meshes are set with (18.16×7.56 Å2, 1× 3×1) for Zn(002)//Cu(001), (7.56×11.15 Å2, 3×2×1) for Zn(101)//Cu(001), (5.19×8.99Å2, 5×3× 1) for Zn(002)//Cu(111), and (10.84×8.38 Å2, 2×3×1) for Zn(101)//Cu(111). Finally, to verify the reconstruction effect introduced by DMSO and water, we used 8-layer (002) Zn slab and (101) Zn slab with both 128 atoms. Before adding DMSO and water, the (002) Zn slab and (101) Zn slab was fully relaxed without large reconstruction. The cutoff force for all DFT calculations was set to below 0.05 eV A-1.
