However, Lithium (Li) is a limited resource on the planet and is therefore not sustainable. As an alternative to lithium, earth-abundant and cheaper multivalent metals such as aluminum (Al) and calcium (Ca) have been actively researched in battery systems. However, finding suitable intercalation hosts for multivalent-ion batteries is urgently needed. Open-tunneled oxides are a particular category of microparticles distinguished by the presence of integrated one-dimensional channels or nanopores. This work focuses on two promising open-tunnel oxides, viz: Niobium Tungsten Oxide (NTO) and Molybdenum Vanadium Oxide (MoVO). We find that the MoVO structure can adsorb greater numbers of multivalent ions than NTO due to its larger surface area and different shapes. The MoVO structure can adsorb Ca, Li, and Al ions with adsorption potential at around 4 to 5 eV. However, the adsorption potential for hexagonal channels of Al ion drops to 1.73 eV because of less channel area. NTO structure has an insertion/adsorption potential of 4.4 eV, 3.4 eV, and 0.9 eV for one Li, Ca, and Al, respectively. In general, Ca ion is more adsorbable than Al ion in both MoVO and NTO structures. Bader charge analysis and charge density plot reveals the role of charge transfer and ion size on the insertion of multivalent ions such as Ca and Al into MoVO and NTO systems. Our results provide general guidelines to explore other multivalent ions for battery applications.

INTRODUCTION Rechargeable (i.e., secondary) batteries represent a critical enabling technology for electrification of automobile as well as storage of energy from renewables such as wind and solar1-3 . The sizing of the active material particle used in the anode and cathode plays a crucial role in affecting battery performance.4,5 Traditionally, microparticles have been used in the industry due to their higher volumetric energy density, high mass loading, better scalability, and lower cost6. However, in terms of mechanics, thermodynamics, and kinetics, microparticles face several challenges which nanoparticles can solve3. Nanoparticles have improved cycle stability over microparticles. Smaller size nanoparticles can intercalate more uniformly compared to microparticles. This improves fracture toughness and fatigue life for electrode materials7–9. Fast charging ability is another superior performance attribute associated with nanoparticles. The small particle size of nanoparticles drastically reduces diffusion length, enabling faster charging and discharging ability10,11. Moreover, the limited compositional range makes it less favorable for distinct phases to co-exist in nanostructures. As a result, phase transitions are much quicker for nanostructures to release the excess free energy generated from a lattice mismatch and high surface area12–14. Nanostructures also have their distinct set of disadvantages. For example, the nanostructures' large surface makes results in extensive electrolyte decomposition. As a result, the Solid Electrolyte Interphase (SEI) layer forms during the early stage of the battery cycle, causing low first-cycle coulombic efficiency15– 17. With nanostructures, it is also challenging to achieve an industrial standard (20–30 mg/cm!) high mass loading.18,19 Nanostructure-based batteries also suffer from low volumetric capacity, which is a major limitation in stationary and grid storage applications20,21. The synthesis cost of nanostructures is also higher and produces significant chemical waste in the manufacturing process22–25. Multiscale particles (MP) have nanoscale features or attributes in microscale particles. These particles have the characteristics of both micro and nanostructures3 and could potentially offer the best of both worlds. MP can be synthesized as Engineered Multiscale Particles (E-MP) or as Multiscale Particles with Natural nano-porosity (N-MP). E-MP can be synthesized in several ways. Controlled assembly of nanoparticles to form microparticles or engineering of nanopores in microparticles by etching techniques", "page": 1, "position": 0}

It consists of a (3×4) size of M𝑂$ (M=Nb, W) octahedral36. These octahedral blocks share edges around the corner, forming open channel-like structures, shown in Fig. 1a. MVO structures (Fig. 1b, c, d) can have different polymorphs - orthorhombic (𝑀𝑜𝑉!𝑂&), trigonal (𝑀𝑜𝑉#𝑂$), and tetragonal (MoV𝑂%). Moreover, they have other tunnels, e.g., hexagonal, heptagonal, pentagonal, rectangular, etc33. The cost of rare earth metal Li is increasing rapidly37,38. One of the alternatives is to use multivalent ions like Ca and Al39,40. Since these ions are multivalent, they can offer similar energy density to Li, despite their greater atomic mass and volume. Ca and Al metal are also earth abundant and low-cost.41–43 Our objective in this work is to study intercalation of multivalent ions such as Ca and Al into N-MPs such as NTO and MoVO. In terms of prior art, Kocer et al.35 have investigated Li insertion on three types of Wadsley–Roth crystallographic shear structures named N𝑏\"!𝑊𝑂##, N𝑏\"(𝑊#𝑂((, and N𝑏\"$𝑊%𝑂%%. Density Functional Theory (DFT) was adopted to find 3 active Li insertion sites: vertical window, horizontal window, and pocket in N𝑏\"!𝑊𝑂## structure. Structural evolution was calculated for L𝑖)N𝑏\"!𝑊𝑂## by varying Li concentration between x=1 and x=13. High Li concentrated structure removes M𝑂$(M=Nb, W) octahedral sites, which causes lattice contraction. This lattice contraction helps to mitigate volume expansion and improves long-term cycle life. In contrast to the above work with Li, there are no reports to date on insertion of multivalent ions such as Al and Ca into NTO or MoVO systems. In this work, we considered trigonal (𝑀𝑜𝑉#𝑂$) structure consisting of hexagonal, heptagonal, and triangular channels with different sizes. Ca, Al and Li are inserted into these MoVO structures. We measured the adsorption potential of Ca, Li, and Al into those channels. We extended the same study to NTO (N𝑏\"!𝑊𝑂##) systems and analyzed the adsorption ability of NTO vs. MoVO structures and focused on the effect of multivalent ion size and charge density on insertion potentials. Our overall conclusion is that MoVO structures are more suitable for multivalent ion insertion", "page": 2, "position": 0}

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION We inserted Ca into trigonal MoVO structures into three different types of channels named heptagonal, hexagonal, and triangular shape5 because they contain 7, 6, and 3-member rings, respectively. Finding the most stable ion position in any specific tunnel is crucial. For this work, we inserted Ca in several places in the hexagonal and heptagonal tunnels and considered the most stable position by comparing the energy of the optimized structure. Heptagonal and hexagonal have a 5-6 Å channel dimension, which is five times bigger than the Ca33. Therefore, they can easily intercalate Ca into their channels which is reflected in Figure 2(b-f). As the triangular tunnel has limited space, it cannot accommodate more than 1 Ca. To calculate the difference in adsorption potential more clearly, we inserted 2 Ca into the heptagonal and hexagonal tunnels. For 1 Ca, heptagonal and hexagonal tunnels have almost similar adsorption favorability of 4 eV (Figure 2b, c, g). Next, we studied the insertion of 2 Ca into the heptagonal and hexagonal tunnels. In this case, the adsorption potential for the heptagonal and hexagonal channels is 3.06", "page": 4, "position": 0}

Li inserts into the heptagonal and hexagonal channels by changing locations to find the most optimized structure. Adsorption potential for 1 Li is highest for the heptagonal tunnel (4.73 eV, Figure 3a, f), and lowest for the triangular channel (3.53 eV, Figure 3c, f).

Like MoVO structures, we computed the adsorption potential for Li/Ca/Al insertion into NTO using DFT. Only one rectangular shape channel is present in N𝑏\"!𝑊𝑂##. We inserted Li/Ca/Al into those channels by varying concentrations (Figure 6a-f). For 1 and 2 Li insertion, the adsorption potential (Figure 6g) is 4.4 eV and 3.44 eV, respectively. The 2 Ca and 2 Al insertion into the channel resulted in the adsorption potential of -0.82 eV and -0.26 eV, respectively (Figure 6g). However, insertion favorability of 2 Ca and 2 Al is positive for MoVO structure because heptagonal and hexagonal channel has 41.67 Å!and 27.19 Å!, respectively. However, for NTO, the area is only 15.36 Å!. These results indicate that channel area and charge density of cation (Table 2) plays an important factor for adsorption favorability.

Li has the highest adsorption potential due to the lowest particle size and less charge density compared to Ca and Al. To obtain a detailed idea about the charge distribution inside the MoVO and NTO structures, Bader charge analysis and charge density difference has been calculated56. △ρ= ρ012 –(ρ0 + ρ2) (4) Here, A is MoVO/NTO crystal structure, and B is the cation inserted into this system, ρ0 indicates the density of MoVO/NTO crystal structures and ρ2 is the density of the cation. Bader charge analysis has determined the number of charge transfers between cations and MoVO structures. Table 1 shows that 1 Al ion charge transferred to a triangular channel has a charge transfer of 1.65e, which is higher than other cations. The charge density plot in Figure 7 shows the relationship between charge accumulation and depletion. In Figure 7m, Al ion has the weakest interactions with all cations at these positions. Therefore, the negative adsorption potential, shown in Figures 4 and 5, is due to the lowest ionization of Al ion and MoVO structure at the triangular channel. Charge transfer for NTO structures is highest for 1 Al ion (Table 2). Consequently, the adsorption potential is, therefore, the lowest for one ion insert (Figure 6g). Concerning two ions insertion, Ca has the highest charge transfer relative to other cations (Table 2). As a result, 2 Ca ions insertion has the least adsorption potential. In general, our charge analyses show inverse correlation between adsorption potential and charge transfer. More charge transfer corresponds to lesser adsorption.", "page": 9, "position": 0}

CONCLUSIONS First-principles calculations were performed by inserting mono (Li) and multivalent (Ca, Al) species into multiscale oxide particles with one-dimensional nanochannels such as NTO and MoVO. Comparison of the adsorption potential of Ca, Li, and Al ions shows that the MoVO structure is more favorable to accommodate multivalent ions than NTO. Large channel areas and different shapes of channel availability, like hexagonal, heptagonal, and triangular shapes, make MoVO a superior intercalation host for multivalent ions as compared to NTO structures. Results obtained from Bader charge analysis and charge density plot reveal that Al ion has the lowest insertion favorability for both MoVO and NTO structures as Al has the highest charge transfer to the MoVO and NTO structures. Ca has adsorption behavior similar to monovalent Li, but it faces challenges in the small channels of NTO structures when 2 Ca ions are inserted. Therefore, channel dimension, ion size, and ion charge density play a crucial role in ions insertion into MoVO and NTO structures. This research can pave the way for the exploration of other candidate open-tunneled oxide materials, for superior performing multivalent-ion batteries.
