(Dated: 5 October 2020) Lithium ion batteries often contain transition metal oxides like LixMn2O4 (0 ≤x ≤2). Depending on the Li content diﬀerent ratios of MnIII to MnIV ions are present. In combination with electron hopping the Jahn-Teller distortions of the MnIIIO6 octahedra can give rise to complex phenomena like structural transitions and conductance. While for small model systems oxidation and spin states can be determined using density functional theory (DFT), the investigation of dynamical phenomena by DFT is too demanding. Previously, we have shown that a high-dimensional neural network potential can extend molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of LixMn2O4 to nanosecond time scales, but these simulations did not provide information about the electronic structure. Here we extend the use of neural networks to the prediction of atomic oxidation and spin states. The resulting high-dimensional neural network is able to predict the spins of the Mn ions with an error of only 0.03 ¯h. We ﬁnd that the Mn eg electrons are correctly conserved and that the number of Jahn-Teller distorted MnIIIO6 octahedra is predicted precisely for diﬀerent Li loadings. A charge ordering transition is observed between 280 and 300 K, which matches resistivity measurements. Moreover, the activation energy of the electron hopping conduction above the phase transition is predicted to be 0.18 eV deviating only 0.02 eV from experiment. This work demonstrates that machine learning is able to provide an accurate representation of both, the geometric and the electronic structure dynamics of LixMn2O4, on time and length scales that are not accessible by ab initio MD.

INTRODUCTION Battery performance plays a key role in the technolog- ical progress of portable electronic devices.1,2 Computer simulations have become an eﬃcient tool for a target- oriented and economic development of battery materials with improved properties3,4 since they allow to reach a fundamental understanding of underlying atomistic pro- cesses enabling systematic advances. However, in partic- ular lithium ion batteries pose a challenge for atomistic simulations as they often contain complex oxides as pos- itive electrode materials, in which the transition metal ions can have diﬀerent oxidation states.5,6 An important example is the commercially used lithium manganese oxide spinel LixMn2O4 with 0 ≤x ≤ 2.7,8 LixMn2O4 has a complex electronic structure in- cluding coexisting Jahn-Teller9 distorted MnIIIO6 octa- hedra and undistorted MnIVO6 octahedra.10–13 The ad- ditional eg electron of MnIII (t3 2ge1 g) leads to increased a)Electronic mail: marco.eckhoﬀ@chemie.uni-goettingen.de b)Electronic mail: joerg.behler@uni-goettingen.de Mn-O distances compared to MnIV (t3 2ge0 g), i.e., the elec- tronic structure has a large impact on the local geometry. During charge and discharge of a battery the Li content varies changing the ratio of MnIII and MnIV ions. In turn, this ratio of the oxidation states aﬀects the charge ordering of LixMn2O4, i.e., the distribution of MnIII and MnIV ions, as well as the electrical conductivity, which is based on electron hopping of the eg electrons among the diﬀerent Mn species.14–17 Thermally induced ﬂuctu- ations of the Jahn-Teller distortions in combination with electron hopping give rise to complex phenomena like structural transitions, charge ordering transitions, and conductance.

However, the limited time and space resolution does not allow for an investi- gation of the dynamics at the atomic scale. On the other hand, oxidation and spin states are readily available in spin-polarized density functional theory (DFT) calcula- tions. Unfortunately, ab initio molecular dynamics simu- lations are computationally too demanding to investigate changes in the eg electron mobility with temperature, especially during the transition from the orthorhombic to the cubic crystal structure, because simulations on nanosecond time scales would be required.18 A solution could be oﬀered by machine learning meth- ods. The construction of atomistic potentials represent- ing the potential energy surfaces of materials enabling large-scale molecular dynamics (MD) simulations has received a lot of attention in recent years.30–32 High- dimensional neural network potentials (HDNNP),33–35 which are a frequently used example for machine learning potentials applicable for various materials,18,36–42 enable molecular dynamics simulations up to nanosecond time scales but they only provide energies and forces while electronic structure information like oxidation states are not directly accessible. However, this information is re- quired for a comprehensive understanding of the full com- plexity of LixMn2O4. In comparison to the high interest in the construction of machine learning potentials, the prediction of further atomic properties related to the electronic structure by machine learning is not as common, although also this ﬁeld is rapidly expanding. Examples are the prediction of atomic charges,43,44 electrostatic multipole moments,45 atomization energies,46 polarizabilities, frontier orbital eigenvalues, ionization potentials, electron aﬃnities, exci- tation energies,47,48 redox potentials,49 nuclear chemical shifts, atomic core level excitations,50 or even quantum mechanical wavefunctions.51 Moreover, the prediction of spin-state splittings and metal-ligand bond distances was successfully performed for transition metal complexes in their equilibrium conﬁgurations.52–55 Here we introduce a high-dimensional neural network (HDNN) for the prediction of oxidation and spin states", "page": 1, "position": 0}

The HDNN is trained on atomic spins obtained from spin-polarized local hybrid PBE0r- D36,56 DFT calculations. This functional was exten- sively benchmarked for LixMnyOz systems and related materials in a previous study showing that the atomic spins obtained for LixMn2O4 reveal coexisting high-spin MnIII and MnIV ions in agreement with experiment.6 The HDNN is able to complement the energies and forces in HDNNP-driven MD simulations by electronic structure information to derive oxidation states, spin conﬁgura- tions, and electron hopping. Using the HDNN we can study the eg electron mobility of LixMn2O4 which has a major impact on the electrical conductivity.16,17 Due to its relevance for battery applications, a detailed un- derstanding of the underlying eg electron hopping is of high interest. Furthermore, oxidation and spin states are of fundamental importance for reduction-oxidation reac- tions such as corrosion and electrocatalysis57 and also for spin crossovers, for example, in the binding process of oxygen to hemoglobin.58 In this study we focus on the relation between the structure of the MnO6 octahedra and the spins of the Mn central ions, which we represent by a HDNN. Us- ing the HDNNP developed in a separate study18 we can perform simulations of LixMn2O4 below and above the transition temperature from the orthorhombic to the cu- bic crystal structure.

The time evolution of the Jahn-Teller distortions of the MnIIIO6 octahedra as well as the electron hopping of the eg electrons are studied from femto- to nanosecond timescales. Furthermore, we investigate the charge or- der of LixMn2O4 at diﬀerent temperatures revealing its complex electronic structure and the impact of ﬁnite size eﬀects. We start by describing the HDNN method to predict oxidation and spin states. After providing the compu- tational details, the reference data set of the HDNN is analyzed with respect to the structure-spin relation, and the quality of the HDNN approach based on the refer- ence data is discussed. Subsequently, the predictions are tested for diﬀerent Li loadings. The discussion of the phase transition, whose structural details were explained already in a separate work,18 is extended by new insights into the electronic information. Especially, the charge ordering transition is investigated in detail. Finally, we address the electron hopping as a function of the temper- ature revealing the role of the phase transition on con- ductivity. II. METHODS The neural network topology we will use here is closely related to the high-dimensional neural network potential approach of Behler and Parrinello.33–35 However, instead of developing a method to calculate a global property like the total potential energy of a given atomic structure R = {Rm n }, we aim to predict the atomic spin Sm n for each atom n of element m in the system, i.e., the goal is to obtain the functional relation Sm n (R), which is similar to our previous work on the construction of environment- dependent atomic charges for including long-range elec- trostatic energies in HDNNPs.43,59", "page": 1, "position": 2}

For clarity the subscript n of the symmetry functions and atomic spin as well as the superscript m of all named properties are not shown. This Figure is a visualization of Equation 1. Like in case of HDNNPs, we cannot simply use Carte- sian coordinates as input for the neural network, because the derived spins must be invariant with respect to trans- lation and rotation of the system as well as to the per- mutation of chemically equivalent atoms. Therefore, the Cartesian coordinates are transformed to atom-centered symmetry functions (ACSFs) G,34 which meet all these requirements and describe the local chemical environ- ments of each atom inside a cutoﬀradius Rc. This cutoﬀ has to be chosen suﬃciently large to include all neighbor- ing atoms, which are relevant for the value of the spin of the central atom. Due to their many-body nature, the number of ACSFs per atom is independent of the actual number of atoms inside the cutoﬀsphere, which is re- quired for the use as input of a neural network with a ﬁxed architecture. For each atom the vector of ACSFs characterizing the geometric environment is then used as input for an atomic feed-forward neural network. The great advan- tage of neural networks is their ability to represent mul- tidimensional real-valued functions with in principle arbi- trary precision.60 Therefore, they are well-suited as func- tional form for Sm n (Gm n ). We note that the atomic spin only depends on the symmetry function vector of the cor- responding atom which in turn depends on all Cartesian coordinates inside the cutoﬀsphere.

The schematic structure of an atomic neural network for the calculation of atomic spins is given in Figure 1. The input layer of an atomic neural network consists of the vector of nG symmetry functions Gm n . This input is processed via hidden layers – in the present case we use two hidden layers with n1 and n2 neurons, respectively – resulting in a single neuron in the output layer. This output is the atomic spin of the given atom. All neurons are connected to all neurons of the neighboring layers by weight parameters aρσ µν, where µ and ν specify the two connected neurons in layers ρ and σ. Additionally, all neurons in the hidden layers and the output neuron are connected to a bias neuron by a bias weight bσ ν, where ν and σ specify the number and layer of the target neuron. Together, the connecting weights and the bias weights are the ﬁtting parameters of the neural network. For the evaluation of each neuron in the hidden lay- ers one proceeds from the left to the right through the network. First, the values of the neurons in the previ- ous layer are multiplied by the corresponding connecting weights and combined, and the bias weight is added. To enable the representation of nonlinear functions, to this linear combination an activation function f is applied – in our case a hyperbolic tangent – and the value is prop- agated to the next layer.

For each element an individual atomic neural network is constructed and replicated as many times as there are atoms of the respective element present in the sys- tem. The entire structure of the HDNN for atomic spin prediction for a system of M elements and Nm atoms, 1 < m < M, per element is summarized in Figure 2. The crucial step is the determination of the weights {aρσ µν} and {bσ ν} of the atomic neural networks, for which we need a reference data set containing the atomic spin values of a representative set of atomic structures. This data set can be used to iteratively optimize the weights until the neural network can reproduce the atomic spins in the conﬁguration space spanned by the trained data with the desired accuracy. In order to check the predic- tive power of the HDNN and to reveal possible remaining errors, predictions for test data, which are not involved in the training process, are compared with known refer- ence values. Only if the error of the test and the training set are comparable the predicted spins can be trusted. Additional validation steps can be applied in analogy to HDNNPs.61 A fundamental requirement for the method to work is that the atomic structure uniquely deﬁnes the atomic spins, which is fulﬁlled if the correct ground", "page": 2, "position": 2}

While in this way the information about the direction of the atomic spin is lost, all required information to determine the ox- idation states and spin conﬁgurations are still available. III. COMPUTATIONAL DETAILS The DFT reference calculations were carried out us- ing the Car-Parrinello Projector Augmented-Wave (CP- PAW) code (version from September 28, 2016)62,63 em- ploying the local hybrid PBE0r functional.6,56 All set- tings regarding the DFT calculations were the same as in our previous work.18 D3 dispersion corrections were applied using the DFT-D3 software (version from June 14, 2016).64,65 Becke-Johnson damping was used together with the settings given for the HSE06 functional accord- ing to our prior benchmark.6 The atomic spins were de- termined by a projection of the spin density onto the one-center expansions of the partial waves. The sum of the contributions was calculated inside a cutoﬀradius of 1.2 times the covalent radius of the respective atom.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION A. Jahn-Teller Eﬀect Our aim is to construct a HDNN, which describes the relation Sm n (R), i.e., the atomic spins must be uniquely deﬁned by the geometric environments of the atoms in- volving the positions of many atoms. Therefore, we ﬁrst have to investigate the relation between the atomic spins and the structures in the reference data set. For this purpose, we use the same reference structures that are underlying the HDNNP,18 i.e., 15228 LixMn2O4 bulk structures, with 0 ≤x ≤2. As our previous study has shown, these structures sample the conﬁguration space of LixMn2O4 accurately up to a temperature of about 500 K. Instead of the atomic energies and forces used for the HDNNP, now the reference data set contains the ab- solute values of the atomic spins calculated as described in Section III as the target property of the HDNN. In order to show that the spins of the Mn ions in these structures are a function of the atomic environment, they are plotted in Figure 3 as a function of the breathing mode and the Jahn-Teller modes of the corresponding MnO6 octahedra Q1 = 1 √ 3 \u0000dx + dy + dz −3d \u0001 , (2) q Q2 2 + Q2 3 = q 1 2 (dx −dy)2 + 1 6(2dz −dx −dy)2 (3) with the distances dx, dy, and dz of the opposite O-O cor- ners and the mean opposite O-O distance d.76 Here, Q1 is a measure for the size of the octahedra, while p Q2 2 + Q2 3 refers to the Jahn-Teller distortion.

Figures 3 (a) and (b) clearly show two main groups of MnO6 octahedra and some intermediate data points, which is not surprising as the structures have been ob- tained in MD simulations containing also continuous transitions between octahedra with and without Jahn- Teller distortions due to electron hopping.18 One group is located between spin values of about 1.5 to 1.7 ¯h with a mean spin value of 1.58 ¯h corresponding to MnIV ions and the other group between about 1.9 to 2.1 ¯h with a mean of 2.01 ¯h corresponding to high-spin MnIII ions. The spins values do not exactly match 1.5 and 2.0 ¯h due to the de- termination by a projection of the spin density inside a cutoﬀsphere of predeﬁned size. This might miss con- tributions of the atom which are outside the cutoﬀor include contributions of neighboring atoms. Still, these values are qualitatively accurate enough to determine the diﬀerent groups and their corresponding oxidation and spin states. Of the diﬀerent structures included in the reference set, all Mn ions in λ-Mn2O4 correctly belong to the MnIV group and all Mn ions in Li2Mn2O4 to the MnIII group as expected. For LiMn2O4, which contains MnIII and MnIV in a ratio of one-to-one, both spins can be identiﬁed. The MnIIIO6 octahedra yield larger Q1 values than the MnIVO6 octahedra (Figure 3 (a)), i.e., the MnIIIO6 oc- tahedra are above average in size. This is in agreement with the additional occupation of the antibonding eg or- bital with one electron, which widens the Mn-O bonds. For about 0.0 ˚A < Q1 < 0.2 ˚A both types of octahedra are present, i.e., it is not possible to reliably distinguish MnIIIO6 and MnIVO6 octahedra by their size.

Therefore, in principle it should be possible to predict the spins of these species using the HDNN. The employed ACSFs are more sophisticated structural descriptors. They do not only consider the opposite corners of the MnO6 octahedra, but as many- body functions they describe for any atom of interest the positions of all neighboring atoms including Li, O, and Mn within the atomic environment of radius 12 a0. Therefore, they can be expected to resolve the structural diﬀerences of the octahedra in more detail than Q1 and p Q2 2 + Q2 3. Nevertheless, we expect that neither simple descriptors nor ACSFs will allow for the unique assign- ment of the oxidation states of all intermediate transition structures, as they represent a continuum of possible dis- tortions and thus in principle cannot be physically as- signed to one or the other species.

High-dimensional Neural Network Spin Prediction Having shown that the diﬀerent spins of the Mn ions are in principle distinguishable based on the shape of the octahedra, we now aim to represent these spins by the HDNN. Starting from the available reference set, we used the atomic spins of 13669 randomly chosen reference structures for training and the remaining 1559 structures for testing. Therefore, in total 682431 atomic environ- ments are included in the training set and 77911 in the test set. More detailed information about the reference data can be found in the Supplementary Material of a separate work.18 The atomic spins cover a range from 0 to 0.117 ¯h for the Li and O ions, i.e., only LiI and O−II ions are present, and from 1.454 to 2.144 ¯h for the Mn ions, i.e., MnIV and high-spin MnIII ions. The small spins on the Li and O ions are a numerical result of the method we employ to determine the reference spins in the DFT calculations, which are not uniquely deﬁned", "page": 5, "position": 0}

The small spins on the Li and O ions are a numerical result of the method we employ to determine the reference spins in the DFT calculations, which are not uniquely deﬁned similar to atomic partial charges. The diﬀerence between the DFT spin density projections and the expected zero spin values, which is up to 0.1 ¯h, can thus be considered as the uncertainty of our target property. However, the spin diﬀerence of 0.5 ¯h for the two oxidation states of the Mn ions is a physically reasonable diﬀerence and suitable as target property for the HDNN. The resulting root mean squared error (RMSE) of the spin for the Li and O ions is 0.010 ¯h for the training struc- tures and 0.010 ¯h for the test structures indicating that the HDNN representation does not add signiﬁcant errors in addition to the DFT uncertainty. For the Mn ions the corresponding values are 0.028 and 0.030 ¯h correspond- ing to a small relative error compared to the diﬀerence of 0.5 ¯h between the two oxidation states.

Lithium Intercalation The most important process in battery applications of LixMn2O4 is Li (de)intercalation, which occurs in charg- ing and discharging. The Li content determines the ratio of MnIII and MnIV ions, and the number of MnIII ions must be equal to the number of Li ions to ensure overall charge neutrality. However, the neural network training process did not include any explicit information about the electrons and no electron or charge conservation con- dition has been imposed neither for the HDNNP nor for the present HDNN. Therefore, in case of the HDNNP all the information must be included indirectly in the potential energy surface, which in the simulations must only yield conﬁgurations with a correct MnIII to Li ra- tio. Consequently, the correct prediction of this ratio is", "page": 5, "position": 2}

This agrees with a previous theoretical study applying GGA+U using the PBE exchange-correlation functional.78 The reported optimization of a single unit cell led as well to a tetragonal structure of LiMn2O4 with the conclusion that the Jahn-Teller distortions are aligned. In contrast, high-resolution diﬀraction ex- periments of the LiMn2O4 spinel report a very com- plex ordering of the Jahn-Teller distorted MnO6 oc- tahedra below the orthorhombic to cubic transition temperature.10–13 The orthorhombic structure exhibits ﬁve diﬀerent crystallographic Mn sites. Three of these sites are predominantly attributed to MnIII and two to MnIV. The Jahn-Teller distortion of each MnIII site is in a diﬀerent direction. However, this structure does not hold the 1:1 ratio of MnIII and MnIV. As a consequence, eight MnIII sites are occupied by MnIV ions. Represent- ing the resulting fractional occupations in this structure would require the use of a much larger system than the 3 × 3 × 1 supercell. This is not yet feasible, and our sim- ulations employing cell sizes up to 3 × 3 × 3 supercells predict an aligned state as minimum. Next, we investigate the charge reordering during lithium diﬀusion along a minimum energy pathway ob- tained from a nudged elastic band calculation79,80 of a cubic Li0.875Mn2O4 cell in a separate work (Figure 6).18 While the Li ion changes from one tetrahedral site to a neighboring one, simultaneously an eg electron hops from a close-by MnIIIO6 octahedron to another MnIVO6 octa- hedron. The diﬀusion of Li ions therefore can result in changes of the MnIII/MnIV distribution.

This ini- tial structure has then been optimized to the closest lo- cal minimum employing the HDNNP, which prevents a global redistribution of the Li ions in the system. The result shown in Figure 7 reveals that the ﬁnal structure matches the expectation that MnIII ions are only present in the x = 1 half and the number of MnIII is equal to the number of Li ions.

Orthorhombic to Cubic Transition Employing the HDNNP we are able to study the atomic details of the orthorhombic to cubic phase tran- sition on nanosecond timescales. In addition, the use of the HDNN further allows to investigate the underlying electronic dynamics of the eg electrons in form of the ﬂuctuations of the atomic spins of the Mn ions. In this section, we will verify that HDNNP and HDNN yield a consistent description of the dynamics of the MnIII/MnIV distribution and prove the conservation of eg electrons during the simulations. This will identify critical points for the prediction which are in accordance with the crit- ical structures observed in Section IV A. The orthorhombic structure is a consequence of the Jahn-Teller distorted MnIIIO6 octahedra, which break the cubic symmetry. The transition to a cubic phase is caused by disorder and reorientations of the MnIIIO6 octahedra.18 The individual MnIII octahedra are still Jahn-Teller distorted but if the dynamics are faster than the observation time or diﬀerent orientations exist in the sample, the average result is a cubic structure. For unit cell simulations, no spatial averaging is given due to the restricted conﬁguration space but due to ﬂuctuations of the lattice constants, the time average is still cubic above the transition temperature.18 The underlying atomic processes are the dynamic Jahn-Teller eﬀect and electron hopping, which are shown FIG. 8.

At ﬁrst glance, this seems to be a prediction error but at the same time also the Jahn-Teller distortion of the MnIIIO6 vanishes for a short time interval of about 50 fs (not re- solved in Figure 8 (c)). Moreover, there are two spikes at t ≈14 ps and t ≈39 ps in Figure 8 (d). These do not reach a spin value of 2.0 ¯h, i.e., they are still a transi- tion state between MnIV and MnIII. In Figure 8 (c) the distortion of the MnIVO6 octahedron is also little larger than usual at these times. This is clearly no Jahn-Teller distorted MnIIIO6 octahedron but it is diﬃcult to classify if the distortion is a result of large thermal ﬂuctuation or if an electron transfer was about to happen. A change of the orientation of the Jahn-Teller dis- torted MnIIIO6 octahedron is observed in Figure 8 (c) at t ≈55 ps. At this time, also the global orientation of the entire system changes from z to y direction. In Figure 8 (d) no change is observable at this time, i.e., the HDNN predicts the correct oxidation state during this reorienta- tion. Short reorientations of only the individual MnIIIO6 octahedra happen, for example, for the MnIIIO6 octahe- dron in Figure 8 (a) at t ≈5 ps to the x direction and for the MnIIIO6 octahedron in Figure 8 (c) at t ≈62 ps to the z direction. In both cases, the orientation changes again to the global orientation after about 0.25 ps. The oxidation state prediction of the HDNN is in both cases correct, i.e., stays at the same spin value, during these transitions. These results show that HDNNP and HDNN yield a consistent description of the dynamics.

The agreement is good even for very short processes. Employing the HDNN we can also calculate the sum of the absolute spin values of all Mn ions in the unit cell at diﬀerent temperatures (Figures 9 (a) to (c)). From ab ini- tio molecular dynamics simulations (see Supplementary Material) we know that this property ﬂuctuates around a mean value of about 28.8 ¯h due to the conservation of eg electrons. The value results from eight MnIII ions with a spin value of about 1.58 ¯h and eight MnIV ions with a spin value of about 2.01 ¯h, which are included in the unit cell of LiMn2O4. In the ab initio molecular dy- namics simulations the number of electrons is constant by construction. However, there is no condition in case of the HDNN. Still, we observe in a simulation at 200 K (Figure 9 (a)) that the conservation of the eg electrons is excellent. At 300 and 400 K, where electron hopping and a dy- namic Jahn-Teller eﬀect is present, the ﬂuctuations get a little larger but still remain close to the reasonable value of 28.8 ¯h.

In combination with ther- mal distortions this can lead to less accurate predictions during the transition in that one Jahn-Teller distortion might already be classiﬁed as vanished but the arising one is not yet classiﬁed as a Jahn-Teller distortion or vice versa. Another source of error can be large thermal ﬂuctuations which lead to classiﬁcation uncertainties.

The charge and Jahn-Teller order are responsible for the orthorhombic crystal structure below about 290 K. In a separate study18 we found a peak in the heat capacity at about 290 K which we assumed to be a charge order- ing transition. Employing the HDNN we can verify this assignment. A phase transition is identiﬁed by a change of an order parameter. To describe the charge ordering transition we can employ C = 1 N tN X t=0 Smin · S(t) |Smin| · |S(t)| , (4) where Smin and S(t) are vectors of all Mn spins in the simulation cell in the minimum conﬁguration and at time t, respectively. Both Smin and S(t) correspond to the diﬀerence between the actual spin values and the mean spin value of all Mn at all times, which is about 1.8 ¯h. For normalization we divide by the length of both vectors. The sum includes all time steps from t = 0 to tN at step N. For C = 1 the minimum charge order does not change with time, for C = 0 the charge order is not correlated to the minimum charge order, i.e., the charge order ﬂuctuates fast. The transition from C = 1 to 0 as a function of the temperature therefore corresponds to the charge ordering phase transition.

In conclusion, our assumption that the peak in the heat capacity at about 290 K is associated to a charge ordering transition is veriﬁed by the HDNN analysis. The MnIII/MnIV distribution as well as the orienta- tions of the Jahn-Teller distortions are disordered in the high temperature cubic structure. However, one still can ﬁnd some frequently occurring patterns. These can also be found in simulations of a single unit cell, but of course in this case the order is the same for the entire structure. As the charge order of the low temperature phase in our simulations can also be constructed using the single unit cell we will concentrate here on the low energy charge orders of the unit cell.

These tiny energy diﬀerences are smaller than the RMSE of the HDNNP for the test set, which is 2.2 meV atom−1, and also below the accuracy of the underlying DFT calculations. Therefore, the diﬀerent charge orders are eﬀectively degenerate in energy. In PBE0r DFT calculations for a cubic LiMn2O4 cell the charge order of Figure 11 (b) is observed as global minimum.6 The distribution of MnIII and MnIV ions as well as the orientations of the Jahn-Teller distortions can change during a MD simulation. Therefore, the diﬀerent mini- mum charge orders can be found oriented in diﬀerent spatial directions.

In Figure 5 (i) the Mn ions are ordered in an alternating pattern of helically aligned MnIII and MnIV ions with the Jahn-Teller elongation in a direction per- pendicular to the helix. A helix is formed, for example, by the four MnIII ions on the right half of the LiMn2O4 unit cell in Figure 5 (i). The helix includes four MnIII ions per turn, i.e., the pitch is equal to the lattice con- stant. As the helix is aligned in z direction the size of the diamonds in Figure 5 (i) increases from the lower right MnIII ion to the upper right MnIII ion clock-wise with the turn of the helix. In Figure 11 (b) the helices of MnIII and MnIV ions are aligned in x direction, for example, the lower four MnIII ions form a helix at half height in z direction. In Figure 11 (a) the Jahn-Teller distorted octahedra are aligned perpendicular to MnIII planes resulting in a tetragonal cell. For a change of the global orientation of the Jahn-Teller distortions the MnIII/MnIV order has to change as already observed in a separate study.18 For the charge order in Figure 11 (b) two degenerate conﬁgura- tions of the global orientation of the Jahn-Teller distor- tions exist. If the MnIII helices are aligned, for example, in z direction, the Jahn-Teller distortions can align in x or y direction. Moreover, also the parallel alignment to the MnIII helices was observed. Therefore, the global orien- tation of the Jahn-Teller distortions can change without a redistribution of the MnIII/MnIV order. This explains the atomistic dynamics in MD simulations of a single unit cell reported in a separate work.18 The charge order in Figure 11 (c) seems to be an inter- mediate state between the other two charge orders.

Electrical Conductivity Electrical transport properties are of central interest for every battery material. Employing the HDNN we can study the underlying electronic processes at ﬁnite tem- peratures in realistic model systems which are capable to represent, for example, the charge ordering transition in LiMn2O4. The electrical conductivity, σ = eµn , (5) is the product of the electron charge e and the mobil- ity µ and number density n of the electrons which are responsible for the charge transport.83 The mobility is proportional to the diﬀusion coeﬃcient D, µ = eD kBT , (6) with the Boltzmann constant kB.84 The diﬀusion coef- ﬁcient in turn is proportional to the electron hopping frequency ν, D = 1 6d2ν , (7) because the electron hopping occurs always to adjacent MnIV sites with the nearest-neighbor Mn-Mn distance d.85 This equation is derived for the limit of low concen- trations of diﬀusing particles. In our case the eg electrons can only hop to adjacent MnIV sites, which are only half of the Mn sites. It should be noted that the correla- tion between the eg electrons can inﬂuence the diﬀusion, which is not included in this model. Because electron hopping is a thermally activated pro- cess, the hopping frequency ν is given by ν = ν0 · exp \u0012 −Ea kBT \u0013 , (8) with the attempt frequency ν0 and the hopping activation energy Ea.86 The activation energy for the eg electron migration is a consequence of the associated Jahn-Teller distortion of the MnIIIO6 octahedra locally trapping the electrons.14,15 For an eg electron hop thermal distortions have to reduce the Jahn-Teller distortion of a MnIIIO6 octahedron and create a Jahn-Teller", "page": 10, "position": 1}

This enables the eg electron to tunnel via the O ion from one Mn site to another. Subsequently, the Jahn-Teller distortion on the former MnO6 octahedron vanishes and emerges on the latter one. Combining Equations 5 to 8 we obtain σT = A · exp \u0012 −Ea kBT \u0013 , (9) with the pre-exponential factor, A = e2d2ν0n 6kB . (10) Experiments show that two thermally activated pro- cesses are relevant for the electrical conductivity of LiMn2O4,16,17 which can both be described by the Arrhe- nius relation in Equation 9. Both processes are governed by hopping of small polarons, i.e., the eg electrons of the MnIII ions. The activation energy of the thermally ac- tivated hopping conduction was measured to be 0.16 eV above the phase transition temperature and it is almost the same below the transition temperature.10,16 To predict the electrical conductivity using the HDNN we have to investigate the dominant conduction process, which is the eg electron hopping. The hopping frequency of the eg electron self-diﬀusion can be analyzed in NpT MD simulations of LiMn2O4 at various temperatures to obtain the ν(T) relation (Equation 8). In Figure 12 the natural logarithm of the eg electron hopping frequency ν due to self-diﬀusion is plotted as a function of the inverse temperature T −1. Electron hops", "page": 10, "position": 2}

The absolute number of electron hops has been divided by the number of eg electrons and by the total simulation time to obtain the hopping frequency ν. The 20 ns MD simulations were analyzed after each picosecond. The results obtained for the 3 × 3 × 3 supercell clearly show two diﬀerent activated processes with a transition between 280 and 290 K (3.45 <∼T −1/10−3 K−1 <∼3.57). This agrees very well with our investigation in Section IV E and the experimentally observed transition at about 290 K.16 The activation energy of the low temperature process (250 to 270 K according to the order parameter in Figure 10) is 0.19 eV, while it is 0.18 eV for the high temperature process (310 to 400 K). This means that the transformation from the charge ordered to the charge dis- ordered phase reduces slightly the eﬀective energy barrier for eg electron diﬀusion among the Mn sites. The resulting value of ν0 obtained from the 20 ns 3 × 3 × 3 supercell data of the hopping frequency ν for the high temperature process is ν0 = 4 · 1013 s−1. This matches the experimental expectation17 because for strongly correlated oxides this frequency is in the range from 1013 to 1014 s−1.87 For the low temperature process the attempt frequency is also in the order of 1013 s−1.

This matches the experimental expectation17 because for strongly correlated oxides this frequency is in the range from 1013 to 1014 s−1.87 For the low temperature process the attempt frequency is also in the order of 1013 s−1. To obtain the pre-exponential factor A (Equation 10), we need the averaged nearest-neighbor Mn-Mn distance in the temperature region from 310 to 400 K, which is d = 2.93 ˚A. Moreover, n equals the number of eg elec- trons per LiMn2O4 unit cell, which is 8, divided by the cell volume with an averaged cubic lattice constant of 8.27 ˚A in the investigated temperature regime. With these data the pre-exponential factor A is predicted to be 2 · 105 Ω−1 cm−1 K. With respect to the experiment16 the conductivity is overestimated by our model by two orders of magni- tude, while it should be noted that the experimentally measured conductivity changes by about four orders of magnitude between 250 and 400 K. The overestimation is probably the consequence of the neglected correlation of the electrons which leads to a lower diﬀusion coeﬃcient as predicted by Equation 7. Due to occupied sites the reverse motion is more probable than another direction because the former site of the eg electron is always empty shortly after the hop. This reduces the diﬀusion coeﬃ- cient. Still, the activation energy of the hopping process can be determined precisely. For the smaller 2 × 2 × 2 supercell the phase transition is not as pronounced as for the 3 × 3 × 3 supercell. If the hopping frequency data of the 2 × 2 × 2 and the 3 × 3 × 3 supercells are compared, it can be observed that they match above about 340 K (T −1 ≈2.94 · 10−3 K−1) which is in agreement with the results of the order parameter (Figure 10).

In conclusion, large simulation cells and nanosecond simulation times are required for an accurate identiﬁca- tion of the phase transition based on eg electron hopping. The eﬃciency of the HDNN method for the prediction of oxidation and spin states fulﬁlls these requirements en- abling investigations of the electronic dynamics. V. CONCLUSION In this work we have trained a HDNN to the atomic spins of the redox-active Mn ions in LixMn2O4, which could be reproduced with an error of only about 0.03 ¯h with respect to the underlying DFT reference data. Us- ing this HDNN we have been able to predict the oxidation and spin states of the Mn ions in MD simulations ob- tained using a HDNNP potential energy surface. The re- sults conﬁrmed that the MD simulations in our separate study18 correspond to reasonable electronic structures in which the Mn eg electrons are correctly conserved and the number of Jahn-Teller distorted MnIIIO6 octahedra has been predicted reliably for diﬀerent Li loadings. Further, the HDNN enables investigations of a charge ordering transition and electron hopping, which are not possible with conventional machine learning potentials. The charge order parameter reveals a phase transition be- tween 280 and 300 K. This agrees well with experimental resistivity measurements observing a transition at about 290 K.16 The hopping frequency reveals this transition between 280 and 290 K as well. The predicted activa- tion barrier of the thermally activated conduction pro- cess for the high temperature phase of 0.18 eV deviates only 0.02 eV from experimental data.16 In conclusion, we have demonstrated that machine learning is able to provide an accurate representation of both, the structural and the electronic dynamics of LixMn2O4. The investigation of the phase transition re- quires time and length scales that are not accessible by ﬁrst-principles calculations. Therefore,", "page": 11, "position": 2}

Moreover, the HDNN method can be applied for molecular transition metal complexes as well. In these systems high-spin and low-spin states can occur, which lead to very diﬀerent metal-ligand distances. Since for a given distance either the high-spin or the low-spin state is the electronic ground state, our method can easily iden- tify the spin states of these systems as well.
