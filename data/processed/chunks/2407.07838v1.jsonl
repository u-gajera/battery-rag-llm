Grigorieva1,2 1 Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Manchester 2 National Graphene Institute, University of Manchester The ongoing efforts to optimize Li‐ion batteries led to the interest in intercalation of nanoscale layered compounds, including bilayer graphene. Its lithium intercalation has been demonstrated recently but the mechanisms underpinning the storage capacity remain poorly understood. Here, using magnetotransport measurements, we report in‐operando intercalation dynamics of bilayer graphene. Unexpectedly, we find four distinct intercalation stages that correspond to well‐defined Li‐ion densities. We refer to these stages as ‘in‐plane’, with no in‐plane analogues in bulk graphite. The fully intercalated bilayers represent a stoichiometric compound C14LiC14 with a Li density of 2.7∙1014 cm‐2, notably lower than fully intercalated graphite. Combining the experimental findings and DFT calculations, we show that the critical step in bilayer intercalation is a transition from AB to AA stacking which occurs at a density of 0.9∙1014 cm‐2. Our findings reveal the mechanism and limits for electrochemical intercalation of bilayer graphene and suggest possible avenues for increasing the Li storage capacity. Introduction Graphite as an anode material for Li‐ion batteries has been studied extensively for many decades and is currently being employed as an essential component in rechargeable batteries [1‐4]. Often used in the form of graphite powder baked onto copper foils, it offers many advantages for battery anodes such as chemical inertness, reversible intercalation, good cyclability and relatively low costs. In an effort to further enhance the performance of graphite‐based anodes, recent research focused on replacing graphite with few‐layer graphene and attempting to establish the factors that govern intercalation of Li ions, particularly into BLG that presents the elementary building block of the AB‐stacked (Bernal) graphite [5‐17]. Promisingly, Li diffusion rates in BLG are found to be two orders of magnitude higher than in bulk graphite [5], which may provide much faster charging‐discharging.

Promisingly, Li diffusion rates in BLG are found to be two orders of magnitude higher than in bulk graphite [5], which may provide much faster charging‐discharging. On the other hand, the storage capacity for BLG – Li‐ion density achievable by electrochemical intercalation – has so far been disappointingly low (𝑛୐୧≲21014 cm‐2 [5,9,10]), that is, 3 times lower than that achieved for stage‐I intercalation of bulk graphite (LiC6) [18‐21]. The only exception is a recent study where intercalation was monitored in a transmission electron microscope (TEM), which reported formation of multilayered metallic lithium [7]. In the latter case, however, the high‐energy electron beam might interfere with the electrochemical process by, for example, contributing to Li ions reduction. The question remains open whether Li‐ion storage above 2x1014 cm‐2 can be achieved in operando, using the standard electrochemistry most relevant for battery technologies. Understanding the limits for the use of bilayer and few‐layer graphene for Li‐ion storage requires knowledge of mechanisms governing Li intercalation, including any structural changes, arrangements of Li ions relative to the underlying graphene lattice, and effects of disorder. While the above factors have been the focus of many computational studies [11,13‐17,22], experimental evidence remains scarce. Among other outstanding questions is the possibility of in‐plane staging, that is, of a sequence of preferential Li configurations replacing each other during intercalation, by analogy with alkali ion intercalation of bulk graphite [23‐27].

However, no signatures of in‐plane staging were reported in several other studies of isolated BLG [5,6,9], implying that the features observed in ref. 8 could have a different origin (e.g., staging in graphene multilayers present in that system, or elastic strain [18,28]). To shed light on the above uncertainties, in this work we study Li intercalation of BLG using an on‐chip electrochemical cell where the entry and exit of Li ions are examined via changes in resistivity and carrier density of graphene. The intercalation process is continuously monitored over many intercalation‐ deintercalation cycles, while the rate of the intercalation reaction is kept sufficiently slow to resolve individual stages. We observe four distinct plateaus in graphene resistivity, corresponding to distinct densities of intercalated lithium, 𝑛୐୧. We refer to these as in‐plane stages (I to IV), not to confuse the effect with the well‐known staging in bulk graphite, where Li ions fill interlayer spaces to the full capacity in one step. Lithium intercalation in our device setup is further verified by in operando Raman spectroscopy. Our measurements of Li ion densities for stages III and IV allow us to identify them as C18LiC18 and C14LiC14, where Li ions attain hexagonal arrangements commensurable with the underlying graphene lattice. Assuming similar commensurability that minimizes Coulomb interactions, low‐density stages II and I are identified as C38LiC38 and C42LiC42. Combining the experimental findings and DFT calculations, we show that C14LiC14 corresponds to the thermodynamic equilibrium for intercalated AA‐stacked bilayers. Another observed stage (C18LiC18) is close to this equilibrium configuration, whereas stages I and II at much lower 𝑛୐୧ are attributed to metastable states within the original AB stacking.

Results A schematic of the experimental setup and an optical image of one of our devices are shown in Fig. 1a&b. BLG was mechanically exfoliated onto a Si/SiO2 substrate and shaped into a Hall bar, with a few m of its edge being exposed to solid polymer electrolyte LiTFSI‐PEO (Supplementary Methods 1.1&1.2). A gate voltage 𝑉୥ between the Pt counter electrode and BLG provided a controlled driving force for electrochemical intercalation. To protect the device from degradation, most of the Hall bar and Au contacts were covered with a passivating layer of SU‐8 resist as shown in Fig. 1b and Supplementary Fig. 1a. This design ensured that Li ions from the electrolyte could enter BLG’s interlayer space (gallery) only through the exposed edge. All measurements were performed in the inert environment of a glovebox with <0.5 ppm oxygen and moisture levels to prevent degradation of the electrolyte. The temperature was kept at 3302 K to ensure sufficient electrolyte conductivity (Supplementary Fig. 1c,d). Intercalation and deintercalation were monitored as a function of time t at 1s intervals via measurements of graphene’s resistivity 𝜌୶୶ and Hall voltage 𝑉୶୷ using the standard lock‐in technique. Employing different pairs of contacts allowed us to probe the uniformity of intercalation over the 20 µm length of our bilayer devices (Fig. 1b). If we swept 𝑉୥, a sharp peak appeared in 𝜌୶୶ and a spike‐like feature in 𝑉୶୷ at a critical value of about ‐3 V (Fig. 1c, Supplementary Fig. 2), which indicated that our initially p‐doped devices (Supplementary Methods 1.3) changed their doping polarity and the Fermi level passed through the neutrality point", "page": 1, "position": 1}

The most notable feature here is the presence of resistance plateaus with well‐defined 𝜌୶୶ values that persisted over extended time intervals up to 20 min and, importantly, reappeared in different cycles and for all the studied devices. Only the time span of the plateaus varied from cycle to cycle (Fig. 2c). Transitions between the plateaus occurred typically within 1 sec (our time resolution) and simultaneously across the whole device, see Fig. 2a for a typical example. Studying different cycles and devices, we found that 𝜌୶୶ for the four observed plateaus was on average 248, 219, 142 and 134  with a standard deviation of 3% (Fig. 1d&e, Supplementary Fig. 4a&b). Plateaus in 𝜌୶୶ were accompanied by plateaus in 𝑉୶୷ measured simultaneously (Supplementary Fig. 3b). To determine the Hall resistivity 𝜌୶୷ at the plateaus, we reversed the magnetic field (switching it between 330 mT by rotating a permanent magnet around the intercalation/measurement setup within the glovebox). This allowed us to avoid spurious offsets in 𝑉୶୷ which sometimes appeared from a 𝜌୶୶ contribution.

During initial few cycles, 𝜌୶୶ and 𝑉୶୷ fluctuated with time without acquiring any specific values (Supplementary Figs 2a & 3a) despite 𝑉୥ being kept constant and applied for several hours. Remarkably, even in this weakly‐doped state the observed fluctuations accurately reproduced at all voltage contacts (Supplementary Fig. 2), which showed that Li‐ion doping occurred practically simultaneously over the entire 20 µm long device and Li ions rearranged themselves into different configurations within 1 sec. This also meant that no macroscopic domains were formed, in contrast to, e.g., Li intercalation of bulk LixCoO2 [30]. After the first couple of cycles, stage I with its 𝜌୶୶  248  and 𝑛୐୧  0.91014 cm‐2 clearly developed, persisting for a long time (inset of Fig. 1d; Supplementary Fig. 3a). In the 4th or 5th cycle and after long (>2 h) exposures to 𝑉୥ = ‐7V, we also started to observe stage IV (lowest 𝜌୶୶  134  and highest 𝑛୐୧  2.71014 cm‐2; inset of Fig. 1d and left panel of Fig. 1e). The latter plots show sharp jumps between the resistance plateaus corresponding to stages I and IV, but the high‐𝑛୐୧ states persisted no longer than a few minutes at a time. Only after further cycles, all four in‐ plane intercalation stages became established and recurred for extended periods of time (Figs 1d&e). Having said that, in later cycles, stage III became poorly defined (transient), gradually transforming into stage IV (Supplementary Fig. 3c; Fig. 1e). In addition, in these later cycles our devices tended to bypass stage I, immediately entering stage II and then making a two‐/three‐ fold jump (in 𝜌୶୶ and 𝑛୐୧, respectively) into the most‐doped state (stage IV). The observed ‘initial softening or training’ of graphite‐based systems during intercalation is well known in the literature and attributed to gradual expansion of the interlayer space during initial intercalation cycles [12,18,21].

As for deintercalation, in contrast to the fast entry of Li ions into the interlayer space, the return to a deintercalated state (after 𝑉୥ was set back to zero) was much slower and became progressively slower still with each cycle (Fig. 4 and Supplementary Fig. 5). Kinks and small steps indicating the in‐plane staging were also observed on 𝜌୶୶ሺ𝑡ሻ curves during deintercalation (insets of Figs. 2b and 4) but they were much less pronounced and lasting than those for intercalation half‐cycles. Furthermore, unlike the well‐defined resistance state reached after each full intercalation to stage IV, 𝜌୶୶ after deintercalation varied considerably and usually decreased with repeated cycling (see Fig. 1c at 𝑡ൌ0) whereas the final carrier density (p‐doping) reached after deintercalation remained approximately the same. This is unexpected because disorder induced by intercalation/deintercalation cycles should generally increase the resistivity. Indeed, another notable feature of deintercalation is that the resistance peak at the transition from n‐ to p‐ doping became progressively broader and smaller with repeated cycling (Supplementary Fig. 5), which indicated increasing inhomogeneity of deintercalated BLG [31], as expected. Only after many intercalation cycles (typically, >10), disorder started playing a critical role in the measured characteristics. Eventually, after 15‐20 cycles, intercalation becomes progressively less effective, and the maximum Li concentrations of 2.71014 cm‐2 could no longer be achieved even after many hours (leading to 𝑛୐୧ ≪ 21014 cm‐2).

The G peak position shifted sharply by 8 cm‐1 as soon as the gate voltage exceeded the threshold value (3.8V for this device) while the longitudinal resistance (measured simultaneously) went through a sharp peak, indicating intercalation. Simultaneously, the 2D peak intensity, 𝐼(2D), became strongly suppressed, with 𝐼ሺ2Dሻ/𝐼ሺGሻ ratio changing from 0.8 before intercalation to 0.5 after. This behaviour indicates strong electron doping [32‐34]. Both peaks returned to the initial position and intensity after deintercalation.

As expected, both G and 2D peaks remain visible for this doping, very similar to the case of stage‐II Li intercalation of graphite, where doping was even higher [35]. Although further cycling led to higher electron density, it was not possible to quantify this evolution using Raman spectra because of the visible degradation of the electrolyte under the laser beam and the strongly increased noise.

The Raman spectra provided a new insight into the intercalation process: Firstly, no D peak above the noise level was observed either before, during or after intercalation, suggesting that intercalation did not induce point defects in our BLG, in agreement with our conclusions from resistance measurements (no increase in resistance after deintercalation). It is possible that the D peak was comparable in intensity with the noise level, which would give 𝐼ୈ𝐼ୋ ⁄ ൏0.02 and a minute possible density of point‐like defects of ൏510ଽ cm‐2 (Supplementary Methods 1.4). Secondly, from the observed shift in the G peak position and the change in 𝐼ሺ2Dሻ/𝐼ሺGሻ intensity ratio we can place a lower limit on the electron doping induced by intercalation in our devices. As they were always significantly p‐doped in the unintercalated state (𝑛 െ10ଵଷ cm‐2), the shift in the G peak position by 8 cm‐1 corresponds to electron doping much larger than 1013 cm‐2 and larger than observed for electrostatically gated bilayer graphene [33].

Discussion The distinct in‐plane staging observed in our experiments seems to disagree with the earlier reports for BLG [5,6,9] and with the behavior known for Li intercalation of bulk graphite. In the latter case, it has been shown that, after first Li islands form between graphene planes, the resulting local strain leads to attraction between neighboring islands, which promotes further intercalation, so that the full capacity of an interlayer gallery is reached as soon as it is opened by first intercalating islands [28] or the system phase‐separates into a 3D checkerboard structure [36]. As for the existing theory, computational studies usually start with assuming a change in stacking of the constituent graphene layers from the AB to AA configuration, which occurs concurrently with Li‐ion intercalation [17,22,27]. Such a single structural transition cannot explain the occurrence of the observed four stages. The only plausible explanation for the four well‐defined plateaus in 𝜌୶୶ and 𝑛୐୧ separated by sharp transitions is distinct configurations into which Li ions rearrange themselves at different stages. The constant 𝜌୶୶ also means that only one phase is present at each plateau: If domains of two different phases were present, e.g., an unintercalated and intercalated one, or domains with different Li ion densities as in graphite [36], we would observe a smooth evolution of 𝜌୶୶ as the higher density domains grow in size [37].

Distinct ion arrangements in our BLG‐Li system are perhaps not surprising because this happens for graphite intercalation where Li ions reside at centers of next‐nearest carbon hexagons, creating a hexagonal superlattice. Accordingly, some (at least, short‐range) order can also be expected for the BLG. Indeed, Li ions should not only occupy their energetically most favorable sites at carbon hexagon’s centers but also would tend to be spaced equidistantly, to minimize the electrostatic energy due to Coulomb repulsion [38]. Importantly, Coulomb repulsion between Li ions is greatly enhanced in BLG with respect to bulk graphite because of much reduced screening in 2D [39,40]. This should favor Li‐ion ordering at longer distances [41]. The suggested commensurability between Li ions and the carbon lattice (rather than random Li positions) is consistent with the fact that disorder played little role in our experiments. Indeed, the reproducibility of 𝜌୶୶ within a few % over many intercalation cycles and for different devices indicates that the observed 𝜌୶୶ values are intrinsic, being determined by electron‐phonon scattering, rather than by disorder induced by Li doping. This conclusion about dominant electron‐phonon scattering for our Li‐intercalated BLG (rather than other scattering mechanisms) agrees with the previous report for heavily‐doped monolayer graphene which showed that its resistivity at room temperature was phonon‐limited [42]. The monolayers exhibited 𝜌୶୶ of 100 Ohm at similar doping (1014 cm‐2), which is a factor of 2 lower than 𝜌୶୶ in our experiments. However, electron‐phonon scattering in BLG should be stronger than in monolayer graphene because of a contribution from shear phonons representing local lateral displacements of the two layers [44] leading to a larger phonon‐limited 𝜌୶୶ compared to the monolayer, as indeed observed for our intercalated BLG. Assuming commensurability between Li ions and the graphene lattice, the measured values of 𝑛୐୧ yield the following", "page": 7, "position": 1}

The results of our calculations for ∆𝐺 are summarized in Fig. 6 where we focus on Li‐ion configurations with high symmetry and, especially, the hexagonal ones that provide equally spaced Li ions and, therefore, lowest contributions to the Coulomb energy (Supplementary Note 2.1). Equidistant Li configurations, shown as bright symbols in Fig. 6, provide local minima in ∆𝐺 with respect to a multitude of other possible more disordered configurations, even if Li ions are allowed to reside only in carbon hexagons’ centers (∆𝐺 for some of the latter configurations are shown as semi‐transparent symbols). Furthermore, Fig. 6 shows that the global minimum in the Gibbs energy, which represents the thermodynamic equilibrium for intercalated BLG, occurs at N = 14 (𝑛୐୧  2.71014 cm‐2), in excellent agreement with the experimentally observed stoichiometry for in‐plane stage IV. Note that this Li ion density (storage capacity) is considerably (2.4 times) lower than that reached for stage‐1 intercalation of bulk graphite [18‐20]. An equally densely packed configuration for BLG, C6LiC6, is energetically unfavorable, presenting a very significant energy loss. Qualitatively, the lower saturated Li density achievable in BLG can be understood as the result of weak screening of interionic Coulomb repulsion [41] by the two graphene sheets, which makes it energetically costly for Li ions in BLG to reside as close to each other as in graphite. For confirmation, we calculated the intercalation energy for stage‐1 graphite and C6LiC6 composition in BLG (Supplementary Note 2.1).

Although AB stacking seems energetically unfavorable with respect to AA stacking for doping levels where the in‐plane staging was observed (𝑛୐୧  0.91014 cm‐2), note that no gradual transition between AB and AA is expected during intercalation because the transition requires nucleation of AA domains within the AB bilayer, which involves local strain.

The strain appears because of the inevitable formation of AB and BA domains during restacking of the graphene layers from AA configuration back into AB configuration during deintercalation (as previously visualized for the case of thermal cycling of BLG [44]), see schematic in the inset of Fig. 4. Furthermore, AB/BA boundaries and, particularly, their intersections containing AA‐stacked areas [44‐46] can serve as nuclei for restacking AB bilayers into AA configuration, which are needed for reaching intercalation stages III and IV. The development of the extensive network of AB/BA boundaries can also contribute to the ‘initial training’ effect observed in our experiments in the first few intercalation cycles as well as an analogous behavior known for graphite‐ based electrodes [47,48]. Indeed, AB/BA boundaries exhibit a larger spacing between the two graphene layers [16], which reduces interlayer adhesion and the energy barrier for Li entry and diffusion [21,25], thus allowing the system to quicker reach stable configurations in subsequent cycles. This can explain why, after several cycles, the time spent during intercalation in AB stacking becomes shorter (Fig. 2c). It is also instructive to note that AB/BA boundaries contain 1D electronic channels with a finite carrier density even at the graphene’s neutrality point [45]. Accordingly, this metallic network developed after multiple cycles should provide a notable electrical conductance within the poorly conducting deintercalated state. This additional conductance explains the counterintuitive observation discussed above that 𝜌୶୶ in the fully deintercalated state decreased after each cycle. As for stages III and IV that occur within the AA stacking, the DFT calculations yield that N = 18 and 14 are also rather close in energy (Fig. 6). Because stage III was often found gradually transforming into stage IV (Supplementary Fig. 3c), we suggest that stage III (N = 18) corresponds to a long‐lived metastable state.

Because stage III was often found gradually transforming into stage IV (Supplementary Fig. 3c), we suggest that stage III (N = 18) corresponds to a long‐lived metastable state. The slow transition between stages III and IV also agrees with the fact that Li ions experience radically different diffusion barriers for AB and AA stacking, which are calculated as 70 and 280 meV, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 10). These values suggest rapid diffusion and, hence, sharp transitions between stages I and II whereas exponentially longer times can be required to reach local equilibria in the case of AA stacking (that is, to move between stages III and IV). We emphasise that an important difference between intercalation of graphite and of our small, defect‐free graphene bilayer devices is the timescale. In graphite intercalation typically takes hours, while in BLG Li ions fill the whole device in one step due to ultrafast diffusion [5]. In principle, one could expect the bilayer to go through all the configurations identified in our DFT calculations as energy minima (Fig. 6), but we only see the most stable ones, with 'jumps' between them due to significant Li density differences and ultrafast diffusion. The 'jumps' happen at a constant gate voltage due to finite energy barriers between different CxLiCx configurations: the largest barrier is for AA domain formation and restacking from AB to AA and an appreciable barrier for Li diffusion through the AA‐stacked bilayer. The time span of each 𝜌୶୶ plateau then depends on the value of overpotential (Supplementary Fig. 4) and with repeated cycling is also affected by developing non‐uniformities as discussed above. Abrupt jumps only occurred between stage I/II (AB stacked bilayer) and stage III/IV (AA stacked), supporting this explanation. The transition from stage III to stage IV was typically smooth (Supplementary Fig. 3c), while a transition from stage I to stage II was observed only once (Fig. 3a).

We have demonstrated that intercalation occurs in AB‐stacked bilayers without immediate restacking to the AA configuration; AA restacking requires achieving a finite, rather large, Li ion density and is itself required to achieve saturation in Li content. The two stages for each stacking order (AA and AB) involve relatively small changes in Li concentrations and are attributed to local equilibria that are close in energy and occur either as metastable states or because of shifting equilibrium conditions during intercalation cycles. We find that BLG can provide only weaker screening of interionic interactions compared to bulk graphite, so that Li ions interact stronger and start repelling each other at longer distances, limiting the storage capacity of BLG. Another surprising finding is the experimental evidence for highly ordered Li configurations (essentially Li ion superlattices) which is of interest for electronic transport properties. It would be interesting to visualize the suggested CxLiCx configurations by other techniques, especially scanning tunnelling microscopy. Data availability.

Device fabrication To fabricate BLG devices, such as shown in Figure 1a of the main text, a bilayer graphene crystal was mechanically exfoliated from bulk graphite and transferred onto a Si/SiO2 (290nm) substrate. This was followed by deposition of metal contacts using standard electron‐beam lithography with poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) resist and e‐beam evaporation of Cr (3nm)/Au (40nm). In the next step a similar lift‐ off procedure was used to fabricate a large counter electrode made of Ta (3nm)/Pt (40 nm) at ∼ 250 μm distance from the BLG and two reference electrodes, also Pt, see Supplementary Fig. 1a. Finally, the bilayer was shaped into a Hall bar geometry using a PMMA etch mask and reactive ion etching in oxygen plasma. To ensure that only a small part of the bilayer is exposed to the electrolyte during intercalation, we used a protective layer of SU‐8 3005 (∼ 5 μm thick) as shown in Fig. 1b and Supplementary Fig. 1a. Owing to the excellent chemical stability and insulating properties of SU‐8 [1], the device and the Cr/Au contacts were protected from unwanted electrochemical reactions that could take place due to contact with the electrolyte. The design of the SU‐8 layer also ensured that Li ions from the electrolyte could enter the bilayer only through the exposed edge of the device. 1.2. Electrolyte preparation and characterization We used solid polymer‐based Li‐ion electrolyte PEO‐LiTFSI [2,3]. The electrolyte was prepared in an Ar‐filled glovebox. Prior to mixing the ingredients, a lithium salt, bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI), and poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) (MW = 100,000 g/mol) were dried overnight at 170°C and 55°C, respectively, and acetonitrile was dehydrated with 3 Å molecular sieves at room temperature. Then 0.10 g LiTFSI and 0.31 g PEO were mixed with 2 mL acetonitrile under continuous stirring at room temperature for at least 24 hours, giving the molar ratio of ethylene oxide to lithium (EO/Li) of 20:1 and a viscosity suitable for drop‐casting.

The electrolyte was solidified through evaporation of acetonitrile at 50°C overnight to form Li ion conductive solid polymer electrolyte. The ionic conductivity of this electrolyte is due to Li ions moving under the applied voltage, as they migrate between oxygen cites on the PEO backbone [3]. The prepared electrolyte was characterized using standard impedance spectroscopy [3] in a Pt–electrolyte–Pt two‐probe configuration, in a frequency range 10 Hz – 500 kHz. Typical Nyquist plots of the electrolyte impedance at several different temperatures are shown in Supplementary Fig. 1c,d. Additionally, we used impedance spectroscopy to determine the internal resistance of our devices, which was found to be 𝑅଴ൎ20 k (see Supplementary Fig. 1b for an example). To analyze the measured spectra, the electrochemical system was modelled as an equivalent electrical circuit shown in Supplementary Fig. 1b, using ZView software. Measurements at temperatures between 30°C and 60°C showed that the ionic conductivity of our electrolyte is strongly temperature‐dependent, increasing 50 times as temperature increased from 30°C and 56°C. Increasing the temperature further, from 56°C to 60°C, had a much smaller effect.

This is due to the fact that restacking requires nucleation of AA domains and these have to be of a sufficient size in order to continue to grow over the whole sample, similar to the growth of nanoparticles but in 2D. To estimate the minimum size of nucleating AA domains in an initially AB‐stacked bilayer graphene, we approximate the domain energy as the sum of an areal energy density 𝜎 associated with restacking of Li‐intercalated BLG (energy gain) and an elastic penalty per unit length of the AA‐AB domain wall 𝛾: 𝐸ሺ𝑟ሻൌെ𝜎𝐴ሺ𝑟ሻ൅𝛾𝐶ሺ𝑟ሻ.

The importance of electrostatic repulsion between intercalated ions in layered materials, where ions intercalate into interlayer galleries, has long been appreciated, notably for graphite [25‐28], MXenes [29] and TiS2 [30]. The authors of refs. [38, 41] (main text) used a simple model of point charges interacting through screened electrostatic interactions to argue that screening has a strong effect on attainable intercalation densities. This effect is especially important for intercalation of ions into BLG, where the same planar density of Li ions per carbon layer (CxLiCx) as in bulk graphite (LiCx) results in less Li‐dense configurations overall, simply because the same number of Li ions are shared by the two adjacent layers in BLG but not in bulk graphite. As the result, the host carbon atoms are less strongly doped, because the amount of charge lost by one Li ion to the surrounding graphene layers is approximately the same in both cases. Accordingly, the density of charge carriers at the Fermi level in Li‐intercalated BLG is lower, which in turn leads to relatively ineffective screening of the interionic repulsion. Our DFT calculations incorporate the effect of screening naturally and allow numerical estimation of its impact. We find a very strong effect of the poorly screened Coulomb repulsion", "page": 26, "position": 0}

Top panel: Three distinct structures considered in the calculations. Each structure contains two Li ions but the distances between the two ions are different in each case. For structure (A) the position of the second Li ion corresponds to the experimentally found stoichiometry, with Li‐Li distance  6.5 Å. For (B) and (C) the inter‐ionic distance is artificially decreased in order to quantify the Coulomb repulsion. Bottom panel: Increase in the interaction energy (referenced to the experimental stoichiometry) as a function of inter‐ionic distance for bulk graphite (yellow symbols) and for BLG (blue). The energy penalty is markedly higher for the bilayer. Supplementary References 1. Del Campo, A. & Greiner, C. SU‐8: A photoresist for high‐aspect‐ratio and 3D submicron lithography. J. Micromech.
