Their operation is based on the formation and decomposition of Li2CO3/C during discharge and charge cycles, respec- tively. We used a multiscale modeling framework that integrates Density Func- tional Theory (DFT), Ab-Initio Molecular Dynamics (AIMD), classical Molec- ular Dynamics (MD), and Finite Element Analysis (FEA) to investigate atomic and cell-level properties. The considered Li-CO2 battery consists of a lithium metal anode, an ionic liquid electrolyte, and a carbon cloth porous cathode with Sb0.67Bi1.33Te3 as a catalyst. DFT and AIMD determined the electrical conductivities of Sb0.67Bi1.33Te3 and Li2CO3 using the Kubo-Greenwood for- malism and studied the CO2 reduction mechanism on the cathode catalyst. MD simulations calculated the CO2 diffusion coefficient, Li+ transference number, ionic conductivity, and Li+ solvation structure. The FEA model, incorporating results from atomistic simulations, reproduced experimental voltage-capacity profiles at 1 mA/cm2 and revealed spatio-temporal variations in Li2CO3/C de- position, porosity, and CO2 concentration dependence on discharge rates in the cathode. Accordingly, Li2CO3 can form large and thin film deposits, leading to dispersed and local porosity changes at 0.1 mA/cm2 and 1 mA/cm2, respec- tively. The capacity decreases exponentially from 81,570 mAh/g at 0.1 mA/cm2 to 6,200 mAh/g at 1 mA/cm2, due to pore clogging from excessive discharge product deposition that limits CO2 transport to the cathode interior. There- fore, the performance of Li-CO2 batteries can be improved by enhancing CO2 transport, regulating Li2CO3 deposition, and optimizing cathode architecture. ∗anhngo@uic.edu, ango@anl.gov 1 arXiv:2501.10954v5 [cond-mat.mtrl-sci] 27 Mar 2025", "page": 0, "position": 0}

Introduction Lithium-carbon dioxide (Li-CO2) batteries, with their high theoretical en- ergy density and CO2 fixation capability, have emerged as a potential energy storage solution [1, 2]. These batteries provide a theoretical specific energy density of 1876 Wh kg−1, which is substantially higher than that of current lithium-ion battery systems [3, 4]. This high energy density makes Li-CO2 bat- teries particularly attractive for applications in aviation, aerospace, and electric vehicles, where lighter and more compact energy storage solutions are crucial [5]. The potential for electric vehicles with much longer ranges or considerably lighter batteries could revolutionize the automotive market [6, 5]. However, Li- CO2 batteries are still in early development stages and face challenges including reaction reversibility issues, low energy efficiency, and the need for improved cathode designs [7]. Ongoing research and development efforts focus on over- coming these limitations, with recent advancements showing promising results [4, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14]. The Li-CO2 batteries operate on a unique electro- chemical principle involving the reversible reaction between lithium and carbon dioxide [1, 2] contributing to CO2 capture and utilization efforts [11, 15]. During the discharge process, lithium oxidizes at the anode, releasing lithium ions and electrons (Li →Li+ +e-). Besides, at the cathode in the presence of solid cata- lysts [16, 4], CO2 undergoes reduction (3CO2 + 4e−→2CO2− 3 + C), combining with lithium ions and electrons to form primarily lithium carbonate (Li2CO3) and carbon (C) (4Li+ + 3CO2 + 4e- →2Li2CO3 + C). This discharge reaction typically occurs at a voltage of approximately 2.8 V [17]. The charging pro- cess reverses these reactions, decomposing the discharge products to regenerate lithium and CO2. However, due to the stability of Li2CO3, this process requires higher voltages, often exceeding 3.8 V [18]. This voltage requirement highlights one of several key challenges facing Li-CO2 battery technology. The formation of solid Li2CO3 and C can lead to electrode clogging and increased internal re- sistance [9, 19]. The high charging voltages necessary for Li2CO3 decomposition reduce overall energy efficiency [20, 21]. Effective cathode catalysts are critical for enhancing reaction kinetics and minimizing overpotentials", "page": 1, "position": 0}

Effective cathode catalysts are critical for enhancing reaction kinetics and minimizing overpotentials in Li-CO2 batter- ies [8, 22]. Unwanted side reactions, particularly electrolyte decomposition, can occur at high voltages [7]. Furthermore, the inherent inertness of CO2 makes its electrochemical reduction challenging, affecting discharge voltage and efficiency [23, 2, 15]. The Li-CO2 battery chemistry faces critical challenges in catalyst perfor- mance, primarily characterized by two fundamental issues, catalyst inefficiency and redox mediator limitations. Noble and transition metal catalysts (such as Pt and Au nanoparticles) demonstrate low catalytic activities for CO2 re- duction/evolution reactions in aprotic media, while 2D materials (e.g., MoS2) exhibit poor structural stability at high current rates [18]. Existing catalysts struggle to maintain consistent performance across multiple charge-discharge 2", "page": 1, "position": 1}

Unlike Li-O2 batteries, Li-CO2 battery liquid catalysts are typically inactive in decomposing discharge products (Li2CO3 and solid carbon), and cur- rent redox mediators fail to effectively facilitate the reversible transformation of reaction intermediates [24]. The formation of Li2CO3, a wide-bandgap insulator, leads to slow kinetics and high voltage platforms (> 4.3 V) during the charg- ing process, significantly decreasing the round-trip efficiency of the battery [25]. The lack of efficient decomposition mechanisms significantly impedes battery cycling efficiency, with most current Li-CO2 batteries only capable of operating for dozens of cycles with low overpotential, even with state-of-the-art catalysts [18]. These challenges necessitate developing novel catalytic systems that can maintain high catalytic activity across extended cycling, demonstrate structural stability at elevated current rates, enable efficient decomposition of discharge products, and provide reversible electrochemical reactions with minimal energy loss. The development of catalysts with high catalytic activity and conductivity is crucial to the research of high-performance Li-CO2 batteries [22]. Promising research directions in Li-CO2 battery technology encompass a range of innova- tive approaches aimed at overcoming current limitations and enhancing overall performance [26, 25, 27]. Advanced solid redox mediators have shown significant potential, as demonstrated by a study using a Cu(II) coordination compound of benzene-1,3,5-tricarboxylic acid. This solid redox mediator enabled a Li-CO2 battery to achieve a higher discharge voltage of 2.8 V, a lower charge poten- tial of 3.7 V, and superior cycling performance over 400 cycles [26]. The use of solid redox mediators addresses the shuttle effect and sluggish kinetics asso- ciated with soluble redox mediators, potentially improving long-term stability and efficiency. Alternative reaction pathway engineering has emerged as another promising direction, focusing on promoting the formation of Li2C2O4 instead of Li2CO3 as the discharge product. This approach can reduce the charge potential and improve overall battery performance [25]. For instance, the use of Mo2C as a cathode material has been shown to stabilize Li2C2O4 as the final discharge product, reducing the charge potential to 3.8 V and", "page": 2, "position": 0}

Innovative catalyst designs, including carbon-based and metal-complex catalysts, are being extensively explored. Carbon-based mate- rials, such as multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs), are widely used as cathodes due to their high electrical conductivity and large surface area [27]. However, their limited catalytic activity for Li2CO3 decomposition has led to investigations of ways to enhance their performance, such as introducing metal catalysts like Ru to reduce overpotentials and improve efficiency [27]. Transi- tion metal compound catalysts have shown promise in improving the catalytic activity and stability of Li-CO2 batteries. For example, the integration of Ru- catalyzed MWCNT cathodes with solid electrolytes has demonstrated enhanced electrochemical reactions involving CO2 [27]. Additionally, nanostructured cata- lyst development with improved conductivity and catalytic properties continues to be a focus area, exploring various materials and structures to optimize bat- tery performance [4, 10, 11]. 3", "page": 2, "position": 1}

To address these limitations, ionic liquid electrolytes based on DMSO (dimethyl sul- foxide) as a solvent and LiTFSI (lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide) as a salt, often incorporating EMIM-BF4 (1-Ethyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluo- roborate), have been developed [28, 29, 30, 31, 3, 32, 4]. These electrolytes are preferred for Li-CO2 batteries due to their superior ionic conductivity, enhanced electrochemical stability, and improved CO2 activation properties. DMSO- based electrolytes exhibit faster Li+ ion diffusion kinetics compared to other solvents like TEGDME (tetraethylene glycol dimethyl ether), resulting in lower polarization potential [28]. Li-CO2 batteries using 3M LiTFSI in DMSO elec- trolyte have demonstrated excellent cycling performance, maintaining stable operation for over 1,900 hours (180 cycles) [28]. In concentrated DMSO-based electrolytes, TFSI- anions can access the primary solvation sheath of Li+ ions, leading to the formation of a LiF-rich solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer, which is beneficial for battery performance [29, 30]. DMSO-based electrolytes demonstrate good electrochemical stability with both the Li metal anode and the reactive cathode at high voltages and elevated temperatures [28]. The use of DMSO-based electrolytes improves the rate capability of the battery, with cells able to deliver flat charge/discharge plateaus at current densities of up to 2,000 mA g-1 [29]. Together, these properties make the DMSO LiTFSI elec- trolyte a promising choice for improving the overall performance and stability of Li-CO2 batteries. The addition of EMIM-BF4 (1-Ethyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate) as an electrolyte material plays several important roles in Li-CO2 batteries. EMIM-BF4 helps in activating CO2 molecules, which is cru- cial for the CO2 reduction reaction in Li-CO2 batteries [31]. The addition of EMIM-BF4 to the electrolyte has been shown to enhance battery performance. In one study, a Li-CO2 battery using 0.1 M LiTFSI in (EMIM-BF4)/DMSO as the electrolyte achieved 500 cycles at 0.5 A/g with a capacity of 500 mAh/g [28].

When combined with other electrolyte components like DMSO and LiTFSI, EMIM-BF4 contributes to the overall per- formance enhancement of Li-CO2 batteries, including higher discharge voltages and increased capacities [32]. Recently, Jaradat et al. used an electrolyte com- bination of ZnI2, LiTFSI, DMSO, and EMIM-BF4 with a volumetric ratio of 2:3 that led to good Li-CO2 battery performance [4]. Although recent research has focused on novel cathode materials and elec- trolytes to improve Li-CO2 battery cell performance [10, 33, 34, 11, 14, 13, 35], most computational work has focused primarily on atomistic-level or continuum- level modeling.

These processes include ion transport through porous electrodes, reaction kinetics, and their impact on cell perfor- mance [40, 41, 42].

Specifically, we calculate the diffusion co- efficients of Li+ and CO2, and the Li+ transference number by examining the mean square displacement (MSD) of the particles over time using the Einstein equation [51], and the ionic conductivity using the Green-Kubo formula [52]. Finally, the atomic-scale insights gained from DFT/AIMD and MD simulations are then integrated into our FEA model, allowing for a comprehensive analysis of cell-level performance. Our FEA simulations investigate various aspects of bat- tery cell behavior, including specific capacity, discharge behavior, and voltage- capacity profiles considering factors such as CO2 transport properties, cathode porosity, and deposition of Li2CO3 and C. The studied Li-CO2 battery cell con- sists of a lithium anode, an ionic liquid electrolyte, and a porous cathode. The electrolyte consists of a mixture of 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluorobo- rate (EMIM-BF4) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) in a 2:3 ratio, supplemented with zinc iodide (ZnI2) and 1 M lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) salt. This specific electrolyte composition has been experimentally demonstrated to yield optimal battery cell performance [4]. The cathode uses carbon cloth coated with a stable transition metal trichalcogenide alloy cata- lyst (Sb0.67Bi1.33Te3), improving CO2 reduction and oxidation kinetics [4]. A schematic representation of our multiscale approach is depicted in Figure 1. This multiscale approach enables us to make predictions about porosity, deposited species quantities, and CO2 concentration variations-parameters that are diffi- cult to assess through experimental methods alone. Furthermore, it allows us to evaluate these properties as a function of time, providing dynamic insights into the battery’s behavior. This computational methodology can be used to test and screen various battery materials, potentially saving significant time and resources by reducing the need for extensive experimental tests. 2.

The unit cell of both Sb0.67Bi1.33Te3 and Li2CO3 compounds (Figure 1 (B)) extended in all three directions such that the lattice constants become more than 20Å to sample 1×1×1 k-meshes of the Brillouin zones, respectively. Ionic and electronic optimizations were alternately performed until the forces on each ion reached less than ±10 meV/Å. For the Sb0.67Bi1.33Te3 surface interaction (Figure 1 (D)), the Perdew-Burke- Ernzerhof (PBE) functional, within the generalized gradient approximation (GGA), was employed to describe the exchange-correlation energy. A plane- wave basis set was used with an appropriate energy cutoff to ensure energy con- vergence, and the interaction between valence and core electrons was treated using the projector augmented wave (PAW) method. A cut-off energy was set at 500 eV and the Brillouin zone sampled at gamma point with a k-mesh of 4 x 4 x 1. The convergence criterion of the total energy was set to be within 1x10−5 eV within the K-point integration and optimizations were performed until the forces on each atom were below 0.001 eV/Å. Finally, to account for the van der Waals interactions, the van der Waals D3 corrections were implemented [59]. Zero-point energy, heat capacity, and entropy corrections were computed using statical mechanics within the harmonic approximation. 2.2.

Atomistic Molecular Dynamics simulations (MD) Classical Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations were carried out using the Large-scale Atomic/Molecular Massively Parallel Simulator LAMMPS [61]. A cut-off distance of rcut = 14 Å is used for both Lennard Jones and Coulomb interactions, and a time-step of δt = 1 fs is utilized. Using a particle-particle particle-mesh solver (PPPM), long-range electrostatic interactions are resolved with an accuracy of 10−4 by mapping atomic charges to a 3D mesh, solving Poisson’s equation on the mesh via 3D Fast Fourier Transforms (FFTs), and interpolating electric fields from mesh points back to atoms.

The initial distribution was generated using the Moltem- plate package [71]. In this process, the simulated system constituents are placed randomly into an oversized cubic box. Then, the system was energetically min- imized to ensure optimal particle distribution. The energy minimization algo- rithm consists of adjusting particle coordinates iteratively [72]. A finite, unitless stopping tolerance for energy (Estop=10−7) that represents the energy variation between consecutive iterations divided by the energy magnitude, and a stopping tolerance for force (Fstop=10−8 kcal/Å), are chosen. After that, the system is agitated using the Langevin thermostat [73] at T=900 K for t=1 ns, followed by the same process using the Nosé-Hoover thermostat [61, 73]. Then, to reach the desired ambient condition of temperature and pressure (T=300 K, P=1 bar), the simulated systems were equilibrated in the NPT statistical ensemble with isotropic constant pressure control using Berendsen barostat [61, 74]. Firstly, from T=900K to T=300K at a constant pressure of P=500 bar for t=3 ns. Secondly, the pressure decreases from P=500 bar to P=1 bar at a constant temperature of T=300 K over a time period of t=3 ns. In the final NPT equili- bration stage, the systems were equilibrated at room temperature and ambient pressure (T=300 K, P=1 bar) for t=10 ns.

Electrode Reactions Cathode Reaction The porous carbon electrode provides a site for the electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide. During operation, CO2 from the external feed side dissolves in the electrolyte, moves through the pores of the positive electrode, and reacts with lithium ions at the active sites. The reaction considered at the positive electrode is [11]: 3CO2 + 4Li+ + 4e−⇌2Li2CO3 + C (E0 d = 2.8V, E0 c = 3.8V) (4) where E0 d = 2.8V and E0 c = 3.8V represent the equilibrium potentials for discharge and charge reactions, respectively [17, 18]. The reaction products (Li2CO3 and C) have limited solubility in the DMSO-based liquid electrolyte (0 mol/L for C and 0.0371 mol/L for Li2CO3). When their concentrations ex- ceed these solubility limits, the electrolyte solution becomes supersaturated [78], leading to the deposition of Li2CO3 and C. This is followed by nucleation and growth of these products in the liquid phase within the porous electrode. These deposited products significantly impact the battery’s performance by covering the active surface area, obstructing pathways for reactive species (Li+ and CO2), and inhibiting further reactions inside the cathode, ultimately contributing to the termination of cell discharge.

The battery cell was segmented into three regions: the anode, separator, and porous cathode. An extra fine mesh was selected for enhanced accuracy.

The parameters used in the simulations are presented in Tables S1, S2, and S3. The applied cur- rent density, iapp, was considered positive when directed from the cathode to the external circuit (Figure 1 (A)). The total current density passing through boundary 3 was designated as iapp. The Li+ flux at boundaries 1 and 3 (JLi) and CO2 flux at boundary 2 (JCO2) were set to zero. Additionally, the bound- ary condition ∇ci = 0 was applied to the relevant boundaries (see Table S2).

The high conductivity can be attributed to the semiconductor nature of Bi2Te3 and the antimony (Sb) doping effect, which augments the carrier concentration [87]. Experimental in- vestigations on Bi2Te3 have reported electrical conductivity values as high as 1.71 × 105 S/m at 323 K [87], further corroborating the computational results. Our calculations reveal that Li2CO3 exhibits a static electrical conductivity of (1.8 ± 0.3) × 10−9 S/m at 300 K, confirming its highly insulating nature. This result closely aligns with experimental measurements of 8 × 10−9 S/m at 393 K [88]. The slight difference between calculated and experimental values is consistent with the expected increase in conductivity at higher temperatures, underscoring the reliability of our computational approach. The insulating na- ture of Li2CO3 can be attributed to its ionic nature and the strong ionic bonds that hinder electron mobility [89]. In Li2CO3, Li+ ions act as the primary charge carriers rather than electrons, a characteristic typical of ionic compounds. The low conductivity of Li2CO3 presents challenges to battery performance, includ- ing high internal resistance and passivation of the electrode surface [90, 91]. To address these challenges, potential solutions include promoting Li2CO3 decom- position through conductive additives or catalysts, designing porous electrodes for increased surface area, or directing the discharge reaction towards products that are easier to decompose (such as Li2C2O4). 3.2. Surface reaction of Sb0.67Bi1.33Te3 as cathode catalyst To comprehensively understand the formation of Li2CO3 and C on the Sb0.67Bi1.33Te3 catalyst surface, we calculated the Gibbs free energy (∆G) changes for various elementary reaction steps on this surface as shown below (steps 1-5) similar to the calculations done in Ref.

The reaction pathway revealed a sequence of intermediate stages, beginning with the adsorption of CO2∗on a Bi site with a Bi-O distance of 3.5 Å, which was marginally endergonic (∆G = 0.002 eV). The coupled addition of Li+ and an electron to the adsorbed CO2∗formed the LiCO2∗intermediate, a highly exergonic step (∆G = −2.3 eV). Subsequent interactions between two LiCO2∗ intermediates produced Li2CO2∗and CO2∗, with a ∆G of −1.2 eV. Further, the conversion of Li2CO2∗and CO2∗into Li2CO3 and CO∗(∆G = −1.7 eV) marked a pivotal step in the pathway. Finally, the generation of carbon was facilitated through the reaction of CO and CO2, an energetically uphill step (∆G = 2.8 eV) that also produced CO3∗on the surface. These results, illustrated in Figure 2 (c), highlight the essential role of coupled electron-cation transfer processes in the growth of discharge products.

The potential-dependent reaction energies were calculated based on the computa- tional hydrogen electrode (CHE) model with reference to the Li/Li+ electrode [92, 93]. The potential-dependent reaction energies profile is shown in Figure 2 (c), and the respective reaction energies of each step are shown in Table 1. To level up the electrochemical step, a potential was applied to the formation of LiCO2. As can be seen in Figure 2 (c), this potential occurs at 2.3 V versus Li/Li+ electrode [4].

The Li2CO3 is formed in step 4, but this step also releases CO∗and a free surface site (∗). This suggests that Li2CO3 formation occurs near, but not directly on, the catalyst surface, reducing the cathode porosity and possibly clogging the cathode pores. These insights into the reaction mechanism have significant implications for cat- alyst design and overall battery performance. The strong affinity of carbon for the catalyst surface, coupled with the energetically unfavorable step of its forma- tion, suggests that catalyst degradation through carbon accumulation could be a concern over long-term battery operation. This highlights the need for strate- gies to mitigate carbon build-up, such as developing self-cleaning catalysts or implementing periodic regeneration protocols.

Li+ solvation structure from large scale MD simulation The structural analysis was conducted utilizing the Radial Distribution Func- tion (RDF), g(r), and Coordination Number (Nc). The RDF quantifies the spa- tial distribution of particles relative to a reference particle, providing insights into the local structural organization that affect the transport properties in the electrolyte.

Here, we chose rmax=12Å. The primary peak in g(r) corresponds to the nearest neighbors, indicating the most probable interparticle distance and interaction strength. This relationship is described by g(r) = e(−βU(r)), where β = 1/(kBT) and U(r) is the interac- tion potential.

Low Li+-Li+ coordination (N(r = 3Å) ≈0.5) minimizes clustering, promoting ion mobility. Multiple solvating species create a dynamic environment, facilitating rapid solvating molecule exchange and enhancing Li+ mobility. The preferential solvation of Li+ by BF− 4 and DMSO allows for more free movement compared to the larger TFSI−anions, resulting in a higher proportion of the ionic current carried by Li+ and thus increasing the Li+ transference number. 3.4. Cell performance from finite element analysis The simulated voltage-capacity curves of the Li-CO2 battery cell during charge/discharge cycles are shown in Figure 4(a). These curves were gener- ated through finite element analysis (FEA) using input parameters derived from atomistic simulations (Figure 2, Table 2) and additional material properties detailed in Tables S1–S3 (Supporting Information). The FEA results were val- idated against experimental data collected at a current density of 1 mAh/cm2, as described in the Supporting Information (SI). A strong correlation between simulated and experimental voltages is observed. During discharge, the voltage profile exhibits three distinct regions: (1) an initial sharp voltage drop due to kinetic overpotential (ϕ1 −ϕ2 −E0) [98], (2) a linear decline attributed to resis- tive losses (ϕfilm) across the growing Li2CO3/C film (average plateau potential: 2.65 V), (3) a \"sudden death\" characterized by rapid voltage collapse after 5000 mAh/g. The latter two phenomena, previously described for Li-O2 batteries as charge-transport limitations through Li2O2 films [99], exhibit analogous behav- ior in Li-CO2 systems. During charging, the cell maintains a stable potential of approximately 4.2 V until reaching 6000 mAh/g, followed by a steep voltage rise. The system achieves a specific capacity of 6200 mAh/g (2.48 mAh/cm2) normalized to the catalyst mass. Figure 4 (b) illustrates the impact of applied current density of 1 mA/cm2, 0.5 mA/cm2, 0.25 mA/cm2, and 0.1 mA/cm2 on the simulated discharge curves of Li-CO2 battery cell and Figure S1 shows the same curves for current densi- ties of 0.2 mA/cm2, 0.3 mA/cm2, 0.4 mA/cm2, 0.6 mA/cm2, 0.7 mA/cm2, 0.8 mA/cm2", "page": 22, "position": 0}

The discharge capacity exhibits a substantial reduc- tion, decreasing from 81,570 mAh/g at a low current density of 0.1 mA/cm2 to 6,200 mAh/g at the high current density of 1 mA/cm2. This observation aligns with prior experimental results, indicating that current density has a significant influence on cell capacity [100]. Furthermore, the discharge voltage plateau de- creases as the current density increases (Figure 4 (b)). The capacity decrease at elevated discharge rates can be attributed to limitations in CO2 transport through the cathode, which becomes saturated with electrolyte and unable to sustain the electrochemical reaction. Consequently, as the discharge rate in- creases, CO2 reduction is confined to a localized area near the cathode-current collector interface. Furthermore, the rapid reduction in porosity due to Li2CO3 and C deposition on the active area’s surface further impedes CO2 transport into the cell, preventing complete utilization of the electrode’s porosity. Figure 4 (c) demonstrates that the capacity of the studied Li-CO2 battery cell decreases 23", "page": 22, "position": 1}

As the current density i increases, there is a rapid decrease in the additional capacity provided by A, resulting in a decrease in the total capacity C. The parameter i0 determines the rate at which the capacity decreases with increasing current density.

As the current density increases further, the capacity approaches the baseline value C0 of 7500 mAh/g. This suggests that at high current densities, the battery’s capacity is primarily limited to its baseline capacity, as the contribution from the exponential term becomes negligible. The exponential decrease in capacity with increasing current density highlights a trade-off between power output and energy capacity [102]. At higher current densities (i ≫0.157 mA/cm2), the battery can deliver more power, but at the cost of reduced capacity. This is a critical consideration in applications where both high-power and high-capacity are required. The connection between cell voltage (V ) and current density (i) during the discharge of the studied Li-CO2 battery cell in Figure 4 (d) is represented by the formula [101, 103]: V = A · log \u0012 i mA/cm2 \u0013 + B (48) where A = −0.256 V and B = 2.696 V. The parameter A represents the slope of the voltage change with the logarithm of the current density/(mA/cm2), while B represents the voltage at a reference current density of 1 mA/cm2. This formula indicates that as the current density increases, the cell voltage decreases log- arithmically, a common characteristic in electrochemical cells due to increased polarization and decreased voltage at higher current densities [101, 103]. The performance of Li-CO2 batteries is governed by a complex interplay of struc- tural and operational parameters, including the initial cathode porosity, CO2 diffusion in the battery electrolyte, initial CO2 concentration in the cathode, and the kinetics of the cathodic reaction. These factors collectively influence key performance metrics, such as capacity and voltage plateau presented at a current density of 0.4 mA/cm2 in Figure S2 and Figure 4 (e) and (f). Our anal- ysis reveals a strong positive correlation between porosity (εl,0) and capacity (C), as demonstrated by the best linear fit equation: C/(mAh/g) = 59479.29 εl,0 −25199.46 (49) This trend is attributed to the increased surface area and improved CO2 acces- sibility in higher porosity structures, which facilitate more efficient electrochem- ical reactions. Similarly, the CO2 diffusion coefficient (DCO2) and initial", "page": 25, "position": 0}

However, the cathodic reaction rate constant (kc) shows a logarithmic relationship with both capacity and voltage plateau, as evidenced by: C/(mAh/g) = 763.86 log(Kc) + 28999.81 (52) V/(V ) = 0.06 log(Kc) + 3.64 (53) This logarithmic relationship underscores the significant impact of reaction ki- netics on battery performance, emphasizing the need for efficient catalysts to optimize reaction rates. Furthermore, both CO2 diffusion and concentration demonstrate positive correlations with the voltage plateau, as shown by: V/(V ) = 2.14 × 107 (DCO2/m2s−1) + 2.80 (54) V/(V ) = 0.01 (cCO2,0/(mol/m3)) + 2.75 (55) These findings indicate that improving CO2 transport and availability not only enhances capacity but also stabilizes the voltage plateau, which is critical for achieving stable and efficient battery operation. A recent study demonstrated a high-performance Li-CO2 battery using a Cu(II) solid redox mediator, achiev- ing a higher discharge voltage of 2.8 V and a lower charge potential of 3.7 V [25]. Therefore, optimizing the cathode porosity, CO2 diffusion and con- centration, while improving reaction kinetics through advanced catalysts, are essential strategies for enhancing the performance of Li-CO2 batteries. Future research should focus on developing innovative electrode materials, electrolyte and catalytic systems to leverage these relationships and advance the practi- cal application of Li-CO2 batteries as a sustainable energy storage technology. For instance, a recent study reported a high-rate Li-CO2 battery enabled by a 2D medium-entropy catalyst, which operates at a high current density of 5000 mA/g and capacity of 5000 mAh/g for up to 125 cycles, far exceeding previously reported values [32]. Figure 5 (a1) and (a2) illustrate how porosity (εl) and volume fraction of Li2CO3/C deposited species (εs) change over space and time with current den- sities of i=1 mA/cm2 and i=0.1 mA/cm2, respectively. Figure S3 presents a comparison of these parameters at i=0.1, i=0.25, i=0.5, and i=1 mA/cm2. For high current density (i=1 mA/cm2), porosity decreases gradually, primarily near the CO2 feed side of the cathode (X/Lpos=1), from its initial value of εl = 0.73", "page": 26, "position": 0}

For high current density (i=1 mA/cm2), porosity decreases gradually, primarily near the CO2 feed side of the cathode (X/Lpos=1), from its initial value of εl = 0.73 to 0.48 at the end of discharge. This decrease is due to the formation of a thin film of Li2CO3/C, represented by the gradual increase of εs from 0 to 0.25 near the cathode feed side. This film formation leads to electrode clogging, im- peding efficient CO2 diffusion into the cathode. For low current density (i=0.1 mA/cm2), Li2CO3/C forms larger structures [105], evidenced by the gradual increase of εs across a wider region of the cathode from 0 to 0.64. This results in a distributed porosity decrease from 0.73 to 0.09, initially allowing more CO2 transport into the cathode. However, as discharge progresses, the substantial porosity decrease hinders CO2 diffusion even at low current densities. Figure 27", "page": 26, "position": 1}

Figure S4 compares concentration profiles at various current densities. At i=1 mA/cm2, the CO2 concentration (cCO2) decreases sharply from its initial value of 4.8 mol/m3 to 0 mol/m3 in the porous cathode, indicating strongly impeded CO2 diffusion. At i=0.1 mA/cm2, the decrease is more gradual. The impediment to CO2 trans- port, which is inversely proportional to the current density, results from the ac- cumulation of Li2CO3 and C on the active cathode surface. This accumulation reduces pore availability for the electrolyte, increases the amount of insulating species, and obstructs pores, collectively restricting CO2 transport and limiting cell capacity (Figure 4 (c)). The nucleation and growth of Li2CO3 significantly impact performance, as described in Figure 2 (c) and the detailed FEA model in section 2.4. Current density plays a crucial role in this process. At high current densities (1 mA/cm2), rapid nucleation near the CO2 feed side forms a thin Li2CO3/C film (Figure 5 (a1), (b1)). In contrast, low current densities (0.1 mA/cm2) promote slower growth, resulting in larger, more distributed Li2CO3 structures and a gradual decrease in porosity (Figure 5 (a2), (b2)). To address these limitations, an ideal cathode should feature: large surface area for reaction sites and product deposition, large pores to facilitate active species transport and prevent clogging, high porosity to accommodate discharge prod- uct growth, and high electrical conductivity and stability. Such a cathode design could mitigate the observed limitations and potentially enhance the overall per- formance of Li-CO2 batteries [106]. 4. Conclusion Our interactive multiscale modeling framework, integrating FEA, MD, and DFT/AIMD, provides comprehensive insights into Li-CO2 battery electrochem- istry. This approach accurately predicts cell performance while considering crit- ical factors such as CO2 transport, cathode porosity, and Li2CO3/C deposition. DFT/AIMD calculations reveal high electrical conductivity of the cathode catalyst, while MD simulations show favorable electrolyte properties.

The preparation of the electrolyte was conducted within an argon-filled glove box, maintaining oxygen and humidity levels below 0.1 ppm to prevent contamination. 1.1.3 Three electrodes set up A three-electrode configuration was employed for conducting electrochemical Linear Sweep Voltammetry (LSV) experiments. The working electrode consisted of Sb0.67Bi1.33Te3 nanofibers (NFs) coated cathodes, while lithium metal disks served as both the counter and reference electrodes. The electrolyte utilized for the electrochemical measurements was saturated with carbon dioxide (CO2). The experiments were performed using a Voltalab potentiostat at a sweep rate of 5 mV/s. 1.1.4 Battery assembly The assembly of the battery was conducted within an argon-filled glove box, maintaining oxygen and humidity levels below 0.1 ppm. The process for assembling the 2032-type coin- cell battery was as follows: (i) the wave spring and spacer were inserted into the coin cell; (ii) a glass-fiber separator, along with 50 µl of electrolyte, was affixed to the anode; (iii) cathodes coated with Sb0.67Bi1.33Te3 nanofibers were attached to the separator. Subsequently, holes were drilled, and the case assembly was secured to the top of the cathode. For the battery studies, a Galvanostatic Battery Analyzer (MTI Corp, BST8-MA) was employed. The cy- cling experiments were conducted within small, sealed bags filled with CO2 at an ambient temperature of 25 ◦C. S-3", "page": 41, "position": 0}
