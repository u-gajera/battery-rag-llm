A, 2025, 13, 3146-3162], we used density functional theory (DFT) calculations to investigate the impact of lattice vacancies on Li-ion transport in both tetragonal (t-LBO) and monoclinic (m-LBO) polymorphs of LiBO2, revealing that B vacancies in either polymorph enhanced lithium-ion transport. In this study, we expand on these findings by using DFT calculations to examine the effects of lattice vacancies on the electronic properties of both t-LBO and m-LBO polymorphs,focusing on the electronic band structure. Our analysis shows that B vacancies can enhance the electronic insulation of t-LBO while improving the ionic conduction of m-LBO. The combined results of our previous and current works indicate that B vacancy generation in LiBO2 may enable t-LBO to function as a promising solid electrolyte and enhance the performance of m-LBO as a conformal cathode coating in lithium-ion batteries. Overall, generating B vacan- cies, such as through neutron irradiation, would offer a viable strategy to improve the functionality of LiBO2 as a promising material for energy storage applications.

Introduction Lithium metaborate (LiBO2) is an electronic insulator that has drawn increasing re- search attention due to its multiple technological applications [1–4]. These include the sur- face coating of the cathode of liquid electrolyte-based lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) [5–8]. The performance and efficiency of LIBs are critically dependent on the properties of the materials used in their construction, particularly those of the cathode and its coat- ing [9–12]. High-voltage cathode materials, which have been developed for LIBs operating at voltages as high as 3 to 5 V, include layered oxides LiMO2 (M = NixMn1−x−yCoy with 0 ≤x, y, z ≤1), spinel oxides LiM2O4 (M = NixMn2−x), and polyanion compounds like LiMXO4 (M = Fe, Ni, Co, and Mn; X = B, P, Si, W, Mo, etc.) [11,13]. However, such a high-voltage window can cause serious stability problems for the liquid electrolyte, the cathode itself, and hence for the overall performance of the LIB [11,13,14]. For example, metal dendrite formation on the", "page": 1, "position": 0}

These problems have challenged the research community to seek effective strategies to mitigate them. To date, two of the most-studied approaches for the materials chemistry of LIBs are: (i) modification of the liquid electrolyte by means of additives in order to improve the stability of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) between the liquid electrolyte and the surface of each of the electrodes, and (ii) modification of the cathode itself by doping one or more structurally-stabilizing element(s) into the lattice structure of the cathode, or by introducing one or more physical barrier layer(s) on the cathode surface to passivate unwanted side reactions [11,13,14]. This passivation of the cathode has been known as the cathode coating of LIBs, which has been studied for more than a decade with numerous coating materials [9–12]. Although traditional coating materials, such as Li- free electronic insulators (e.g., Al2O3, AlF3, MgO, ZrO2, SiO2), have demonstrated their ability to enhance the overall performance of LIBs, their limited Li-ion conductivity and solubility result in increased overpotentials [16]. This means that more energy is required for the coated electrode compared to that of its uncoated counterpart to achieve the same electrochemical performance. These limitations have driven researchers to explore alternative coating materials, including lithium-containing compounds such as LiAlO2 [17, 18] and LiBO2 [5–8], whose electronic and Li-ion conduction models resemble those of SEIs of LIBs [16]. LiBO2, in particular, has recently been found to have significant potential to stabilize cathode materials, especially some layered oxides LiMO2 (M = NixMn1−x−yCoy with 0 ≤ x, y, z ≤1), resulting in their increased overall electrochemical performance. Zhang et al. [8] synthesized LiBO2-coated LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2 for use in polyetheracrylate-based solid- state batteries, reporting a capacity retention of 84.3% after 150 cycles at 0.5 C. Wang et al. [19] found that LiBO2 coating on LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 significantly improved its performance, achieving a retention of 90.1% after 100 cycles at 1 C (3.0-4.6 V), compared to 72.3% for the unmodified material.

[21] employed a solution method to coat LiNi0.8Co0.15Al0.05O2 with LiBO2, resulting in an initial capacity of 173 mAh g−1 and a retention of 94.2% after 100 cycles at 1 C and 55 °C (3-4.3 V), which was superior to the unmodified sample’s 75.3% retention. Interestingly, LiBO2 material coating on the surface of the cathode and doping boron into its crystal lattice have been reported to synergistically enhance the overall perform- ance of LIBs even further [5, 6]. For instance, Gao et al. [5] reported that doping the cathodes with boron and coating them with LiBO2 simultaneously boosted the electro- chemical performance of the LiNi0.6Co0.1Mn0.3O2 (NCM613) cathode material operating at high charging/discharging rates, high temperatures, and high voltage cutoffs. Specific- ally, they revealed that their optimized NCM613 cathode coated with LiBO2 and doped with boron has shown its outstanding cycling stability at room temperature, retaining 94.8% of its capacity at 1 C after 100 cycles and 70.7% at 5 C after 1000 cycles (2.8-4.5 V). At 45◦C and 1 C, this modified NCM163 cathode also exhibited an initial discharge capacity of 195.8 mAh g−1 and maintained 88.0% of its capacity after 100 cycles, signific- antly outperforming the pristine NCM163 material, which only retained 67.3%. Moreover, the modified NCM163 material showed a higher lithium diffusion coefficient compared to its pristine NCM613 counterpart. Therefore, this work suggested an alternative approach to modify the cathode materials of LIBs using the B element. This suggestion is in line with published works [22,23] demonstrating that the recently-developed family of boron- containing liquid electrolytes, which resulted in a favorable SEI, stabilizing and enhancing the performance of LIBs cathode materials. Because of its aforementioned potential as an effective cathode coating, recent ba- sic research focusing on ionic and electronic properties of LiBO2 has been increasingly revived in order to provide insights into the design and development of more effective LiBO2-based cathode coatings.

These values were consistently higher than those observed for the m-LBO with a two- dimensional network across the entire temperature range. Islam et al. [25] conducted density functional theory (DFT) calculations for the formation and diffusion of Li defects in m-LBO crystal and the effect of Li defects on the electronic density of states (DOS). They found that the defect modified the DOS of the perfect crystal with the presence of defect levels in the band gap. They also found that there are numerous possible pathways of Li+ diffusion in the m-LBO, including those along the xy plane. In our previous work [26], we systematically examined the formation of Li, B, and O vacancies in both m-LBO and t-LBO and their effects on Li-ion transport using DFT calculations. We found that the formation energy of lattice vacancies increases from Li to O, then to B. For Li-ion transport, O vacancies lower the migration energy barrier (Em) in m-LBO but increase it in t-LBO. In contrast, B vacancies reduce Em in both m- LBO and t-LBO, enhancing diffusivity and ionic conductivity. Thus, our previous work suggested that creating B vacancies using such an approach as neutron irradiation [27] may improve ionic conductivity in the LiBO2 material. Basalaev et al. [28] have studied the electronic band structures of both m-LBO and t-LBO using DFT calculations and shown that the values of the band gap are 10.4 eV and 7.6 eV for t-LBO and m-LBO, respectively. Nevertheless, how the lattice vacancies affect the electronic band structures of these polymorphs is still an open question. Answering this question is of paramount importance for better designing and engineering conformal LiBO2-based surface coatings of the cathode [9–12]. This is because a conformal surface coating is supposed to simul- taneously hold multiple conflicting protective mechanisms of its functionalities, including ionic and electronic transport properties, which", "page": 4, "position": 0}

Computational Methods DFT calculations were performed to investigate the electronic band structures of both pristine and defective crystals of the m-LBO (space group P21/c) and t-LBO (space group I¯42d) polymorphs of LiBO2 material. These calculations were carried out using the WIEN2K code [29], which is based on the full-potential linearized augmented plane wave (FP-LAPW) and local orbital basis set method to solve Kohn–Sham equations to calculate the electronic band structures of the LiBO2 solid crystals [31]. The Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) form of the Generalized Gradient Approximation (GGA) was employed for the exchange-correlation energy functional [32]. The core and valence electrons were treated self-consistently within the all-electron framework. For both polymorphs, a convergence criterion of 0.0001 Ry for the total energy was applied. A Monkhorst-Pack k-point mesh of 5×5×5 k-points was adopted for the Brillouin zone sampling and the Brillouin zone integration is carried out using the modified tetrahedron method [33], and the plane wave cut-off parameter RKmax was set to 7.00, ensuring ad- equate basis set completeness. The Muffin-tin radii were carefully chosen to avoid overlap and were respectively set to 1.61, 1.14, and 1.32 Bohr for Li, B, and O atoms in m-LBO and were respectively set to 1.66, 1.30, and 1.51 Bohr for Li, B, and O atoms in t-LBO. Defective lattice structures were modeled by introducing one lattice vacancy per su- percell at either Li or B or O site into the respective supercells for each of the m-LBO and t-LBO polymorphs constructed from the fully optimized pristine (i.e., perfect or nonde- fective) crystal structures, which were subject to full relaxation of atomic positions and lattice parameters until the force acting on each atom was less than 1 mRy/Bohr) (See Ref. [26]). Afterwards, the defective supercells were also fully relaxed until the aforemen- tioned criteria of total-energy and force convergences were fulfilled. In this work, we have mainly focused on 1 × 1 × 1 supercells so that we could attain highly concentrated lattice vacancies. Our goal is", "page": 5, "position": 0}

Experimentally, neutrons, in particular thermal neutrons, can generate either Li or B vacancies in compounds containing these elements such as LiBO2 by transmuting either the 10B (19.9% of B) or 6Li (7.5% of Li) isotopes at their respective lattice sites via the 10 5 B +1 0 n (0.025 eV) →4 2 He (1.47 MeV) +7 3 Li (0.84 MeV) + γ (0.48 MeV) or the 6 3Li + 1 0n (0.025 eV) →3 1H (2.73 MeV) + 4 2He (2.05 MeV) + 4.78 MeV nuclear reactions [38,39]. As observed in the outcomes of our experimental characterization of the m-LBO surface irradiated with thermal neutrons at various neutron doses (not shown here, will be reported elsewhere [40]), the concentration of lattice vacancies was found to be dose- dependent. Accordingly, for sufficiently high neutron doses, the vacancies were no longer isolated, but aggregated into clusters and mutually interacting. Thus, our 1 × 1 × 1 supercells with one B vacancy per unit cell, which contains four B atoms, could model the case that all of 10B sites are completely transmuted with intense and/or prolonged exposure of the material to thermal neutrons, e.g., in the extreme environments mentioned above. In principle, one could investigate computationally the generalized supercells of de- fective crystals of the form Li1−xB1−yO2−z with 0 ≤x, y < 1 and 0 ≤z < 2. In this work, we only focus on a limited number of cases for each of the two polymorphs, namely, (x = y = z = 0, i.e., pristine), (x = 0.25 and y = z = 0, i.e., Li vacancy), (y = 0.25 and x = z = 0, i.e., B vacancy), and (z = 0.125 and x = y = 0, i.e., O vacancy).

Results and Discussions This section focuses on presenting and discussing the outcome of our DFT calculations of electronic band structures for both t-LBO (Section 3.1) and m-LBO (Section 3.2) polymorphs. 3.1 Effects of Lattice Vacancies on Electronic Band Structure of Tetragonal LiBO2 Figure 2 shows the electronic band structures calculated for the tetragonal LiBO2 poly- morph: pristine (Pri t-LBO, Figure 2a), Li-vacancy (Livac t-LBO, Figure 2b), B-vacancy (Bvac t-LBO, Figure 2c), and O-vacancy (Ovac t-LBO, Figure 2d) supercells. Pristine Tetragonal LiBO2 (Pri t-LBO): Figure 2a presents the calculated elec- tronic band structure of the Pri t-LBO, which manifests an indirect band-gap electronic band structure with the valence band maximum (VBM) located at the N k-point of the Fermi level and the conduction band minimum (CBM) located at the Γ k-point and sep- arated from the VBM by a band gap of Eg = 7.3 eV, the value that is less than that (Eg = 10.4 eV) calculated by Basalaev et al. [28] using a computationally demanding hybrid functional method and is attributed to the limitation of a less computationally demanding GGA method used in our current work to underestimate the value of Eg. It is noted that, (1) the energy level of the top of the valence band at the Γ and the Z k- points are very close (≈0.2 eV) to the Fermi level, and (2) the energy levels of the bottom of the conduction band at Γ and Z k-points are also very close (≈0.2 eV). Therefore, the cross-band-gap Γ-to-Γ or Z-to-Z excitations of the electron from the top of the valence band to the bottom of the conduction band might need energies approximately of the order of Eg = 7.3 eV without the need of a phonon absorption to fulfill the law of momentum conservation, suggesting that the Pri t-LBO might behave in reality as a quasi-indirect band gap insulator at elevated temperatures under a stimulation of sufficiently strong 9", "page": 8, "position": 0}

At first glance, it appears that there are no obvious modi- fications of the band structure of the t-LBO polymorph in the presence of Li vacancies. However, a closer look shows the following important changes: First, while the minima of the lowest energy dispersion relation E(k) curve of the conduction band are still located at Γ and Z k-points with the VBM at the former, all of the E(k) curves of the conduction band were shifted up in energy by ≈0.5 eV, a considerable amount of energy compared to the thermal energy (≈0.026 eV). Second, the curvatures of the lowest E(k) curve of the conduction band at the Γ and Z k-points of the Livac t-LBO (see Figure 2b) are both smaller than those of the Pri t-LBO (see Figure 2a), indicating that the Li vacancies reduce the mobility of electrons excited to the conduction band of the m-LBO polymorph. Third, the CBM of the band structure of the Livac t-LBO is still located at the same k-point (i.e., the N k-point) as that of the Pri t-LBO, suggesting that the indirect band gap feature is still preserved with the presence of Li vacancies. The Fermi level, however, is shifted down by ≈0.2 eV to the energy levels of the maxima of the highest E(k) of the conduction band at the Γ and Z k-points. This means that the energy levels introduced by the B vacancies between VBM and the Fermi level manifest the acceptor levels of the B vacancies, and the Livac m-LBO might behave as a p-type semiconductor with a wide band gap of Eg = 7.8 eV, which is 0.5 eV higher than that (Eg = 7.3 eV) of the Pri t-LBO as a result of the uplifting of the conduction band by 0.5 eV as aforementioned. Fourth, the curvatures of the highest E(k) of the valence band at its maxima (i.e., at the Γ, Z, and N k-points) are smaller (i.e., the E(k) curve at these k-points is flatter for the", "page": 10, "position": 0}

Nevertheless, this value of σion and the band gap Eg = 7.8 eV both show that the Livac t-LBO is not suitable as a potential conformal cathode coating of Li-ion batteries since the coating should be both a good ionic conductor and an electronic conductor. B-vacancy Tetragonal LiBO2(Bvac t-LBO): Figure 2c shows the band structure of the Bvac t-LBO. In general, the modification of the band structure induced by B vacancies exhibits similar features to those discussed above for the Livac t-LBO with some minor differences. These features are briefly described as follows: First, the conduction band of the Bvac t-LBO is shifted up by 0.3 eV, which is less than that (0.5 eV) of the Livac t-LBO while the minima of the lowest E(k) curve of the conduction band are still located at both the Γ and Z k-points with the CBM located at the Γ k-point. Second, the curvatures of the lowest E(k) curve of the conduction band at both the Γ and Z k-points are smaller than those of the Livac t-LBO and the Pri t-LBO, meaning that the mobility of the electron excited to the conduction band is reduced even further in the presence of B vacancies in the t-LBO polymorph. Third, like the case of the Livac t-LBO, the VBM is located at the N k-point while the Fermi level is pushed down by 0.14 eV, which is slightly less than that of the Livac t-LBO, meaning that the energy band of the acceptor introduced by B vacancies, which are located between the Fermi level and the VBM (see Figure 2c), is a bit narrower than that introduced by Li vacancies (see Figure 2b). Yet, the Bvac t-LBO might still behave as a p-type semiconductor with a wide band gap of Eg = 7.6 eV, which is wider than that (Eg = 7.3 eV) of the Pri t-LBO, but narrower than that (Eg = 7.8 eV) of the Livac t-LBO.

However, in terms of the electron/hole transport deduced from our DFT-calculated electronic band structure shown in Figure 2c, the combined findings of our previous [26] and current works suggest that the Bvac t-LBO would be a potential candidate as a solid electrolyte rather than a conformal cathode coating. This is because the Bvac t-LBO possesses a wide band gap (Eg = 7.6 eV) (i.e., a good electronic insulator) which exceeds the high-voltage window (3 to 5 V) of Li-ion batteries. In addition, the acceptor levels are located very close to the top of the valence band that will accept electrons to the sites of B vacancies, which are then negatively charged to facilitate Li-ion transport via a vacancy-mediated diffusion mechanism (i.e., positively- charged Li+ ions could be electrostatically driven by the negatively-charged B vacancies to hop into their sites on their diffusion pathways [26]). Yet, a good electronic insulator is not suitable to be a conformal cathode coating since there still is a certain voltage drop across the coating layer due to a high electronic resistivity. O-vacancy Tetragonal LiBO2 (Ovac t-LBO): Figure 2d presents the band struc- ture of the Ovac t-LBO. Compared to Li and B vacancies in the t-LBO polymorph, O vacancies modify the band structure significantly. First, the conduction band of the Ovac t-LBO is substantially shifted down in energy by 2.6 eV, instead of shifting up as seen for both the Livac t-LBO (up by 0.5 eV) and the Bvac t-LBO (up by 0.3 eV). Second, the shapes of all energy dispersion E(k) curves of the conduction band are completely changed in comparison with those of the Pri t-LBO.

Third, the valence band is also substantially modified. The VBM is now moved from the N k-point for the Pri t-LBO to the X k-point for the Ovac t-LBO. In addition, the VBM is located at the energy level of 1.7 eV below the Fermi level. The highest E(k) curve of the valence band is modified in such a way that it is more wavy than those of the Livac t-LBO and Bvac t-LBO. The energy band gap (Eg = 6.4 eV) is thus less than that for the other three systems. Fourth, a remarkable new feature is generated: deep defect energy levels are introduced by oxygen vacancies into the band gap. The bottom of the defect band (DBB) and the top of the defect band (DBT) are respectively located at the N k-point (0.7 eV above the VBM) and at the X and P k-points (4.7 eV below the CBM). The vacancy sites of O2− anions act as the deep centers to trap electrons. Thus, they were called in the fields of electro- and photo-optics as the color, Forbe, or F-centers [45]. An F center is a type of crystallographic defect that forms when a negative ion is removed from a crystal lattice, leaving behind a vacancy. This vacancy can capture an electron, potentially giving the material a colored appearance. Finally, because of electrons being trapped to the deep defect levels of oxygen vacan- cies, the Fermi energy level is no longer located at the VBM, but rather moves to the top of the defect band (TDB), resulting in a reduced effective indirect band gap, which is as small as Eeff g = 4.7 eV, indicating that the Ovac t-LBO is not as good an electronic insulator as the Bvac t-LBO for use as a solid electrolyte. In addition, our previous work (see Ref. [26]) showed that the ionic conductivity of the Ovac t-LBO is estimated to be σion = 7.6 × 10−8 S cm−1, which is too", "page": 13, "position": 0}

As a typical descriptor of a direct-band-gap intrinsic insulator, both the conduction band minimum (CBM) and valence band maximum (VBM) are located at the same Γ k-point, and the Fermi level is aligned with the VBM. In addition, the value of Eg is also less than the value (Eg = 7.6 eV) calculated by Basalaev et al. [28] using an expensive hybrid functional method. Yet, sim- ilar to their calculations, our calculations showed that the value of Eg of the Pri m-LBO is smaller than that of the Pri t-LBO, even though both were underestimated due to the 15", "page": 14, "position": 0}

Finally, it is suggested that while both the Pri m-LBO and the Pri t-LBO are good electronic insulators, the latter apparently insulates electrons even better. Li-vacancy Monoclinic LiBO2 (Livac m-LBO): The electronic band structure of the Livac m-LBO is slightly modified from that of the Pri m-LBO in the presence of Li lattice vacancies, as shown in Figure 3b. First, the material retains a direct band gap at the Γ k-point, but the band gap energy is slightly reduced to Eg = 5.6 eV, leading to an increased electron concentration, ne(T), at temperature T since ne(T) ∝e−Eg/kBT [43]. Specifically, it is shown that at the room tem- perature (T = 300 K = 0.026 eV), nLivac n-LBO e /nPri m-LBO e ≈e−5.6 eV/0.026 eV/e−5.8 eV/0.026 eV ≈ 2.2 × 103. This estimated ratio suggests that ne of the m-LBO polymorph might be in- creased by 1000 times at 300 K in the presence of Li vacancies. Second, it is noted that the lowest energy dispersion relation curve E(k) of the con- duction band near the CBM becomes flatter, indicating a slightly reduced curvature of E(k) vs. k at the Γ k-point and consequently an increased electron effective mass and hence a reduced electron mobility. Third, the Fermi level shifts down by 0.2 eV below the VBM, and the CBM lies at a slightly lower energy compared to the pristine structure. The defect energy states introduced by Li vacancies are shallowly positioned between the VBM and Fermi level, indicating that the Li vacancies act as electron acceptors and therefore the Livac m-LBO resembles a wide band-gap p-type semiconductor. Finally, to assess the Livac m-LBO’s applicability, we recall its Li-ion transport prop- erties from Ref. [26]: its ionic conductivity is σion = 7.0 × 10−13 S cm−1, seven or- ders of magnitude lower than the σion = 7.0 × 10−5 S cm−1 of the Livac t-LBO. While both are lower than the ionic conductivity of typical Li-ion battery liquid electrolytes (σion ∼10−2 to 10 S cm−1 [44]), our comparison suggests that the", "page": 15, "position": 0}

Nevertheless, the curvature of the lowest energy dispersion relation E(k) curve of the conduction band at the CBM (i.e., at the Γ k-point) is substantially reduced in comparison to those of both the Pri m-LBO and the Livac m-LBO, revealing a larger effective mass, and hence a smaller electron mobility, than those of both the Pri m-LBO and the Livac m-LBO. Second, the VBM is still at the Γ k-point, but 0.2 eV above the Fermi level, indicating a direct band gap of Eg ≈4 eV, significantly smaller than those of both the Pri m-LBO and Livac m-BO. Like the Livac m-LBO, the empty energy levels between the Fermi level and the VBM, which are introduced into the band gap by B vacancies, manifest shallow acceptor levels, typically occurring in the electronic band structure of a p-type wide band-gap semiconductor. Third, there is a E(k) curve in the middle region of the band gap. This new curve is attributed to the presence of B-vacancy-induced deep levels that collectively form a defect band of 0.85 eV in width, whose bottom-most level (abbreviated as DBB) is at the Γ k-point and is located at the energy level 1.18 eV above the VBM level and whose top- most level (abbreviated as DBT) is at the Z k-point and is located 2 eV below the CBM level. Unlike shallow levels, deep levels are located significantly far from the conduction or valence band edges and have highly localized wave functions, meaning the trapped charge carriers (in this case, the carriers are electronic holes rather than electrons as in the Ovac m-LBO discussed below) are tightly bound to defect sites (i.e., B vacancies). At zero tem- perature, these deep levels are unoccupied with electrons (i.e., empty states), suggesting that B vacancies may act as deep centers that trap electronic holes instead of electrons (i.e., hole trapping centers) as shown in Figure 3c. However, at", "page": 16, "position": 0}

However, if ∆E ≥2 eV, they become recombination centers for both electrons and electronic holes, playing the role of stepping stones for charge carriers (e.g., Li+ ions, electrons, and electronic holes) to jump between sites in the Bvac m-LiBO lattice, facilitating the carriers to conduct an electric current upon the application of a sufficiently strong bias voltage (e.g., the voltage across a LiBO2 solid electrolyte sandwiched between the cathode and anode of Li-ion battery cells operat- ing at voltages higher than 3 V), or facilitating a photocurrent upon the absorption of UV-Vis photons. For ∆E ≥2 eV, both electrons and electronic holes can participate in the electric conduction; however, electronic holes are the major carriers and electrons are the minor carriers. This is because the number of electronic holes per unit volume (i.e., the concentration), nh(T) ∝e−(EDBB−EVBM)/kBT = e−1.18 eV/kBT, is much greater than that of electrons, ne(T) ∝e −ECBM−EDBT kBT = e−2 eV/kBT. For example, at room temperature (T = 300 K = 0.026 eV), nh/ne ≈4.6 × 1013, meaning that the concentration of elec- tronic holes is 13 orders of magnitude greater than that of electrons in the presence of B vacancies in the lattice of the m-LBO polymorph. Finally, from the application points of view, in order to select the Bvac m-LBO as a solid electrolyte (a good electronic insulator) or/and a conformal cathode coating (a good electronic conductor), one must first consider the electron transport with an effective band gap for the electron excitation at a finite temperature. This effective band gap would be estimated as Eeff g = ECMB −EDBT = 2 eV (see Figure 3c), which is much smaller than those of the Pri m-LBO (Eg = 5.8 eV) and the Livac m-LBO (Eg = 5.8 eV). Effectively, the excitation of electrons from the \"stepping stone\" energy level of the defect band top (DBT) at the Z k-point to the CBM at the Γ k-point manifests an indirect-band scenario.

O-vacancy Monoclinic LiBO2 (Ovac m-LBO): Figure 3d shows that O vacancies substantially modify the electronic band structure of the m-LBO polymorph. First, similar to the Ovac t-LBO (see Figure 2d), the VBM of the band structure of the Ovac m-LBO is moved from the Γ k-point to the X k-point. In contrast, this movement does not happen for both the Livac m-LBO (see Figure 3b) and Bvac m-LBO (see Figure 3c) for which the VBM was still located at the same Γ k-point as observed for the Pri m-LBO (see Figure 3a). Second, like the Ovac t-LBO, the energy level of the VBM of the Ovac m-LBO is not at the Fermi level, but about 2.46 eV below it. This is in contrast to the Bvac m-LBO (see Figure 3c) for which the Fermi level is aligned with the VBM. Third, similar to the Ovac t-LBO (see Figure 2d) and the Bvac m-LBO (see Figure 3c), there is also a curve of the energy dispersion relation E(k) in the middle of the band gap of the Ovac m-LBO. This curve is attributed to one of the defect bands (a deep-level defect band or defect band 1, DB1), which is introduced by O vacancies and spans an energy range of 1.36 eV from the defect band bottom (DB1B) (which is located at the Γ k-point and 1.1 eV above the VBM) to the defect band top (DB1T) (which is 2 eV below the bottom of another defect band introduced by oxygen vacancies). Similar to the Ovac t-LBO (see Figure 2d), the Fermi level is located at the DB1T rather than at the VBM, meaning that these deep levels also act as the electron trapping centers or F centers. However, unlike the band structure of the Ovac t-LBO, there is another defect band, the defect band 2 (DB2), introduced into the band gap of the band structure of the Ovac m-LBO, just 0.2 eV below the CBM.

The DB2 acts as an effective conduction band while the DB1 acts as an effective valence band. Thus, the band gap is effectively reduced to Eeff g = 2 eV from the nominal band gap of Eg = 6.9 eV. As a result, similar to the Bvac m-LBO, the Ovac m-LBO could be considered as a good electronic conductor for its use as a conformal cathode coating with the condition that its ionic conductivity must be high enough. However, our previous work reported that the Ovac m-LBO is a poor Li-ion conductor with the critically low ionic conductivity of σion = 6.1×10−6 S cm−1 (Ref. [26]) 19", "page": 18, "position": 1}

Overall, the Ovac m-LBO should be neither a solid electrolyte nor a conformal cathode coating of Li-ion batteries. In summary, the combined outcomes of our current work and previous one (see Ref. [26]) suggest that the Bvac t-LBO might be a promising candidate for the solid electrolyte of Li-ion batteries, while its Bvac m-LBO counterpart has potential as a conformal cathode coating of Li-ion batteries. 4. Conclusions In conclusion, our studies highlight the potential of B vacancies in the LiBO2 material for enhancing its performance in lithium-ion battery applications. By improving the electronic insulation of the t-LBO polymorph and the electronic conduction of the m-LBO polymorph while boosting the ionic conductivity of both polymorphs, B lattice vacancy engineering emerges as a promising strategy for optimizing the properties of LiBO2 as either a solid electrolyte (t-LBO) or a conformal cathode coating (m-LBO) for its use in Li-ion batteries. In reality, as aforementioned in the Introduction, m-LBO rather than t-LBO is stable at ambient temperature and pressure, it is therefore suggested from our works that the LiBO2 material in the presence of B vacancies would be considered to be a potential conformal cathode coating in the form of crystalline films. It is noted that cathode coatings were reported to be partially or fully amorphous, though their structures largely depend on the specific synthesis methods and conditions. In some cases, these methods may lead to coatings with nanocrystallite morphologies. Small-particle-on-large- particle coating methods reported by Chen and Dahn [46] and Zhao et al. [47] are examples of the formation of crystalline coatings on the cathode surface. Nevertheless, this work has only focused on the crystalline polymorphs of the LiBO2 coating rather than its amorphous ones, as the former are the simplest to study using atomistic modeling techniques and serve as a benchmark for assessing coating performance in more complex thin films and their interface with the electrodes [16]. Overall, our combined DFT findings underscore the importance of lattice vacancy manipulation, particularly through", "page": 19, "position": 0}
