Strain dependent energies are determined directly from defective cells and also within linear elasticity theory from the elastic dipole tensor (Gij) for ground state and saddle point conﬁgurations. We analyze ﬁnite size-eﬀects in the calculation of Gij, compare the predictions of the linear elastic model with those obtained from direct calculations of defective cells under strain and discuss the diﬀerences. Based on our data, we calculate the variations in vacancy concentration and mobility due to the presence of external strain in bulk LiCoO2 cathodes. Our results reveal that elastic in-plane and out-of-plane strains can signiﬁcantly change the ionic conductivity of bulk LiCoO2 by an order of magnitude and thus strongly aﬀect the performance of Li-secondary batteries. Keywords: Stress/strain, defect thermodynamics and kinetics, elastic dipole tensor, ﬁnite-size-eﬀect, ionic mobility I. INTRODUCTION The presence of strain ﬁelds can signiﬁcantly inﬂuence the eﬃciency and lifetime of functional materials such as semi- conductors, solar cells and Li-ion batteries [1–10]. In prin- ciple, strain can be internally generated by structural defects within the bulk and/or interfaces or can be induced by external loads. These strains or corresponding stresses can cause lat- tice deformations and distortions and therefore also aﬀect the formation and migration of point defects. As a result, the con- ductivity of an ionic conductor can be signiﬁcantly changed [11–15]. This coupling is most relevant in Li-ion batteries, where due to charging/discharging processes, bulk and inter- facial as well as thermal strains can occur. The", "page": 0, "position": 0}

As a result, the con- ductivity of an ionic conductor can be signiﬁcantly changed [11–15]. This coupling is most relevant in Li-ion batteries, where due to charging/discharging processes, bulk and inter- facial as well as thermal strains can occur. The fact that in- duced stresses, which raise during intercalation, could weaken the interface between electrode/electrolyte and ﬁnally degrade the battery performance has been extensively discussed in the past [16–27]. Much less is known, however, about the cou- pling of strain ﬁelds to the formation and migration of Li va- cancies in the bulk part of the material. As one of the ﬁrst, Choi et al. [28] have examined the eﬀect of intercalation-induced stress on Li migration in LiCoO2 using experimental techniques such as electrochemi- cal impedance spectroscopy together with cyclic voltammetry. They showed that the mismatch strain between intercalated and deintercalated states in LiCoO2 is due to a phase transi- tion between the α and β phases. This results in intercalation- induced stress in the phase boundary region. Since an inserted Li ion causes structural disorder in the host material, it intro- duces a strain ﬁeld which aﬀects the next intercalated Li and leads to a strain-induced elastic interaction between all inter- calated Li ions. This elastic interaction has both short and long range eﬀects and it was also found that as the particle size decreases, the stress gradient across LiCoO2 particles in- creases. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diﬀrac- tion and electrochemical strain microscopy (ESM) have revealed that upon delithiation the c-axis in LixCoO2 (x=0.5) expands by about 2% [29, 30] and rather large stresses occur during charging/discharging process at diﬀer- ent charge/discharge rates (c-rates) [31–34].

Li et al. also reported that com- pressive stress raises while the Li concentration is decreasing and at x=0.5, the measured strain at the O-Co-O octahedral slabs is 4.8% [36]. A mathematical model was developed by Renganathan et al. to reveal the mechanical stresses gener- ated during the discharge process in carbon and LiCoO2 [37]. Their ﬁndings show that at high discharge c-rates, stresses also increase and the stress caused by phase transformations is re- lated to the amount of each phase present in the electrode. They also concluded that particle size and distribution can af- fect the generated stress [37].

They have shown that as the discharge rate increases the particle size should decrease so that fracture is prevented (for c-rates more than 5 C, particle sizes less than 200 nm) [38]. While all these studies point to the fact that signiﬁcant stress and strain levels can occur in cathode materials of Li- secondary batteries, their inﬂuence on Li-ion diﬀusion has hardly been studied. In a recent theoretical work Ning et al. [23] have shown that by applying uniaxial tensile strain along the c-axis of bulk LiCoO2, the Li diﬀusion barrier de- creases [23], but did not derive consider the case of a more complex tensorial strain ﬁeld. In this study, we calculate the elastic dipole tensor [39] in order to characterize the coupling of strain ﬁelds to the for- mation and migration energies of Li vacancy in bulk-LiCoO2. We obtain the components of the elastic dipole tensor for de- fect formation and also migration from total energy calcula- tions within density functional theory. Similar calculations of the defect dipole tensor have been recently reported for defects in metals and silicon by Varvenne et al. [40] and in UO2 by Goyal et al. [15]. In order to demonstrate the degree of coupling between lateral and longitudinal components of the stress tensor in LiCoO2, various supercell geometries are studied. Moreover, we compare the predictions from linear elasticity theory with directly calculated formation and migra- tion energies of vacancy under strain and show that the elastic dipole-tensor allows us to quantify the inﬂuence of strain in a computationally eﬃcient manner. Finally, we estimate the eﬀect of lateral and longitudinal strains on ionic conductivity in bulk LiCoO2. II.

Moreover, there will be an interaction between this defect and a stress or strain ﬁeld present in the crystal. This is similar to the interaction of an electric dipole with an applied electric ﬁeld. Therefore, a defect inducing lo- cal distortions is called an elastic dipole, which is -contrary to the electric dipole- characterized by a second-rank tensor. This elastic dipole tensor, which is also called double force tensor [39], is the negative derivative of the defect formation energy Ed with respect to an imposed bulk strain Gi j = −∂Ed ∂ϵij , if, as usual, we ignore entropy contributions. Thus, Gi j is re- lating the atomic structure of a point defect and its elastic ﬁeld. In case of a purely dilatational strain the defect relaxation vol- ume ∆V = 1 3BTr{Gij}, where B is the bulk modulus, can be directly obtained from Gij. In principle, the concept of the elastic dipole tensor can be conveniently understood by ex- panding the free energy per volume in terms of the density of defects nd = Nd/V and the strain tensor ϵi j (both being in- tensive quantities) [41].

As such Gi j describes the interaction of the defect with a strain ﬁeld. The change in energy under strain that is exclusively due to the presence of a defect is given by ∆E = − X i j Gi jϵi j. (2) Thus, for example, a positive lattice strain would lower the formation energy of a defect having a positive relaxation vol- ume.

Note that -depending on the stress deﬁnition- diﬀerent sign conventions have been proposed in literature. Here we stick to the original one used by Leibfried and Breuer [39]. With relation (3) it is straightforward to compute the com- ponents of the elastic dipole tensor numerically using atom- istic methods. In a given periodic supercell, an individual de- fect is introduced. While the cell parameters are ﬁxed, the atomic positions are relaxed and the induced stress is calcu- lated.

In supercell calculations, there will be a certain unwanted contribution to the energy described in Eq. 1 from the in- teraction between the defects in their periodic images. It is therefore necessary, either to correct for this interaction, or to increase the size of the repeating unit to make it negligible. In the case of charged defects, another contribution comes from the Coulomb interaction between the defects, which must be corrected as shown by Leslie and Gillan [41]. Elastic contri- butions can usually be made small enough by increasing the cell size. If ab-initio methods are used, however, the acces- sible cell sizes are rather limited and elastic interactions can induce higher order eﬀects, that are not covered by linear elas- ticity. As can be seen from Eq. 4, the variation of stress by a defect follows the relation ∆σij = −Gij/Vo and thus goes to zero in the dilute limit (limVo→∞∆σij = 0). Therefore, by plotting the components of ∆σij as function of the inverse vol- ume, one can test the convergence behavior of the calculated stresses. For small supercell sizes higher order eﬀects will af- fect the linearity of ∆σij with respect to the inverse volume. In practice, a polynomial ﬁt including higher order terms are required. The coeﬃcient of the linear term dominates at small values of inverse volume and thus still corresponds to the elas- tic dipole tensor.

(5) Note, that Ed(ϵi j) can also be directly calculated as shown later. In the present work, we only consider a neutral Li vacancy. The reason is that we want to disentangle the electrostatic and elastic interactions. The conventional way to calculate the for- mation energy of defects in the neutral state and in the pres- ence of strain is to use the following equation [42] Ed(ϵij) = E(Li−vacancy) tot (ϵij) −Ep tot(ϵij) + µLi. (6) In this equation, the ﬁrst term is the total energy of the strained system containing a single neutral Li vacancy, the second term is the total energy of the strained pristine system and the last term is the strain-free chemical potential of the Li reservoir. This can be compared to the defect formation energy as a function of strain calculated from Eq. 5 for a speciﬁc con- centration. It should be noted here that the vacancy formation energy depends on the chemical potential of lithium in the reservoir, which is taking up the removed Li atom. Thus, in principle one has to consider the fact that strain might also aﬀect the reservoir. We now move to the coupling of defect migration and strain ﬁelds. The energy barrier that is required for an ion to jump between two sites is obtained by the energy diﬀerence be- tween the saddle point and the initial conﬁguration Eb(ϵ) = ES (ϵi j) −Ed(ϵi j), (7) where ES is the energy of the defective system in the sad- dle point (transition state) and Ed the energy of the defective initial state. For a system under strain, the energy barrier can be com- puted by applying a particular strain to the simulation cell and direct calculation of this energy diﬀerence. Alternatively, one can also calculate the defect dipole tensor GS i j", "page": 2, "position": 1}

For cal- culating the ∆Gi j, we perform two single point calculations, one for the initial and one for the transition state in order to obtain ∆σd i j. Afterwards, using Eq. 4, the elastic dipole ten- sor for the initial and transition state can be calculated. The atomic coordinations used in the single point calculations are obtained from the NEB calculation for the unstrained case. Therefore, by performing only one NEB calculation at ϵi j = 0, the strain-dependent activation barriers for Li-diﬀusion can be investigated. Model structures Fig. 1 (a) shows the unit cell of bulk LiCoO2. Li atoms (vi- olet color) are coordinated within the octahedrals of CoO−2. During the delithiation, Li vacancies are formed and start to migrate. Considering the layered structure of LiCoO2, we expect a signiﬁcant inﬂuence of strain on the formation and migration of these vacancies. The strain can either origi- nate from the expansion/contraction during the deintercala- tion/intercalation, respectively, or can be applied externally (e.g. interfacial strains from SEI, solid electrolyte or binder).", "page": 2, "position": 2}

Li, O and Co are shown with violet, red and blue, respectively, while migrating Li and Li vacancy are shown with green and white, respectively. In Fig. 1(b), the direct mechanism of Li diﬀusion towards the single vacancy is indicated (or migration of vacancy to- wards Li). During this process, the Li ion must overcome an energy barrier Eb by pushing the two nearby Li ions and pass- ing through them. This mechanism is shown in Fig. 1(b) and (c) by gray arrows. Therefore, Li on the saddle point is un- der compressive stress (tensile on its neighbors). While there are also other Li migration mechanisms reported [16, 43], in the following, we will focus on the strain dependence of the formation and migration of a neutral single Li vacancy mov- ing on a direct pathway. Since we are only interested in the strain dependency, we deliberately study neutral cells in order to disentangle electrostatic image interactions of the charged defects from the elastic image interactions being also present. Computational details The calculations were performed using the local atomic- orbital DFT-code SeqQuest [44] with norm-conserving pseu- dopotentials and the generalized-gradient approximation of Perdew, Wang and Ernzerhof (PBE) [45] for exchange and correlation. Spin optimization is performed during all geom- etry relaxations. The energy convergence criterion for all cal- culations is 1 × 10−5 eV.

For all calculations, grid spacing for the charge density integration is set to 0.16 Å. Convergence tests with respect to k-point sampling and grid spacing show that calculated stresses are well converged (less than 0.0002 GPa). For the charge density diﬀerence calculation, the re- laxed structures from SeqQuest calculations were used in the DFT-code VASP [47]. The unit cells for all VASP calculations were optimized again while the energy-forces criteria and spin polarization were chosen similar to ones used in SeqQuest calculations. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION I. Size dependence of elastic dipole tensor (Gij in dilute limit) In order to capture ﬁnite-size eﬀects, we used supercells with diﬀerent volumes and aspect ratios. We also investi- gated the degree of coupling between lateral and longitudi- nal components by studying various cell geometries.

For the isotropic case (Fig. 2 - left), due to computational limitations, the 4×4×4 supercell is not calculated. In all cases, the non-diagonal elements exhibit small values.

The separation of defects along the z-axis between periodic images for 1 × 1 × 1 is equal to 13.96 Å, while across the xy-plane, it is equal to 2.85 Å. Therefore, we expect a stronger defect-defect interaction between the pe- riodic images in the xy-direction rather than along the z-axis. In all geometries, where the z-extension was varied (see Fig. 3), the xx and yy components of the elastic dipole ten- sor are comparable (about 1.2 eV), while the zz component is strongly varying and is even changing its sign in case of the 1×1×n cells indicating a strong coupling between xx, yy and zz components. We determined the components of the elastic dipole tensor by ﬁtting the relation ∆σi j = −Gi j/V + β/V2 to the calculated data. The second term is accounting for the fact that higher order contributions to the elastic dipole tensor might be signif- icant. Using the mechanical deﬁnition of stress, we describe outward stress on the cell boundaries with positive and inward stress with negative signs. This means that the absence of pos- itive (outward) stress would lead to cell contraction and vice versa (∆V = 1 3BTr{Gi j}).", "page": 3, "position": 2}

These plots show the scaling behavior from lateral (or longitudinal) extension alone towards isotropic one. It can be seen that the Gxx/Gyy and Gzz components do not show a linear scaling behavior. This is due to the fact that in these relatively small cells image-image interactions are still strong (especially across the xy-plane). Figure 5 reveals the origin of the strong coupling between Gxx-Gyy and Gzz components. For this, we have plotted the charge density diﬀerences (ρdefective −ρpristine) for two super- cell dimensions, namely 3×3×1 and 3×3×2.

Figure 5 indicates the charge distribution diﬀerence between defective and pristine structures as the lattice is increasing along z-axis. It can be seen that by lattice extension along the z-axis, the overlap of orbitals is decreasing which leads to the minimization of defect-defect interactions. However, due to the especial geometry of LiCoO2 unit cell, despite the 3 times repeated cell along the xy-plane, the two defects be- tween nearby images still show signiﬁcant electrostatic inter- actions (although the overlap of orbitals along the xy-plane is also decreasing but with a less progress) which can be trans- lated to the rather strong coupling of xy-plane stress compo- nents.

II. Defect formation energy under strain In order to investigate the eﬀect of strain on the defect formation energy in LiCoO2, we used Eqs. 5 (dipole-tensor method) and 6 (direct method). With SeqQuest we calcu- lated a value of 2.86 eV for the formation energy of a neutral Li vacancy in the 3×3×1 supercell as our reference for the unstrained case, which is in agreement with data previously reported by Hoang et al. [20]. Fig. 6 shows the change in defect formation energy as a function of external strain (laterally, in the xy−plane) with two FIG. 5. Charge density diﬀerence (ρdefective −ρpristine) for 3×3×1 and 3×3×2 supercells. Green and yellow colors show charge accumu- lation and depletion, respectively, with an isosurface value of 0.001 |e|/Å3 for both supercells. The position of Li vacancy in the mid- dle and orbitals separation are indicated with red circles and arrows, respectively. The supercells boundaries are also shown with dashed black lines. methods and two DFT codes. For all cases, the red points are obtained from the direct calculation in which the total energies of pristine and defective are strained. In this case, we can directly calculate the formation energies under strain. Since we need to calculate the total energies in each strain regime, this is computationally time-consuming. The second method is shown with the blue points which are obtained from Eq. 5. In this case, we only need the total energies of unstrained pristine and defective supercells, together with the already- calculated Gi j for that speciﬁc supercell. The directly calculated strain-dependent defect formation energies show a slightly non-linear behavior", "page": 5, "position": 0}

By comparison between two plots, negligible diﬀerence between two methods of DFT calculations (atomic orbitals and plane waves basis sets and diﬀerent pseudopotentials) is evident. metry breaking will lead to this deviation from linear elastic- ity. Similarly Aschauer et al. found a non-linear behavior for the strain dependence of oxygen formation in MnO [50]. The reason why linear elastic theory fails to predict this trend is ﬁrst due to the fact that there are higher order terms relevant in the Taylor expansion given in Eq. 1. Another reason is that the elastic constants of the defective system are not the same as in pristine system. Regardless of the methods and supercell sizes, it can also be concluded that under the inﬂu- ence of lateral elastic strain, the formation energy of a single neutral vacancy in bulk LiCoO2 varies by about 0.02 eV (with ϵ = 1%).

The results are shown in Fig. 7. The calculated values for the 3×3×1 and 4×4×1 deviate by about 10%, while the smaller cell shows a signiﬁcantly smaller migration barrier. In order to reduced computational eﬀorts, we have chosen the 3×3×1 supercell in order to investigate the strain eﬀect on migration energy bar- rier. Figure 8 shows migration barriers for vacancy hopping as function of strain using the directly calculated data (red in the xy-plane) and those obtained from the elastic dipole tensor method (blue in the xy-plane and green along the z-axis) for 3×3×1 supercell using Eq. 8. For the direct calculations, four lateral strain states are introduced homogeneously on the lattice parameters of a and b. The calculation of the elastic dipole tensor in Eq. 8 was performed at the initial and saddle points for the 3×3×1 supercell. Since we already calculated Gi j for the initial state (Fig. 2), we used the geometry of the saddle point from the NEB calculation for the unstrained case to obtain the Gij for the transition state. We obtain the following values for the elastic dipole tensor in the initial state and at the saddle point: Ginitial =  1.66 0.01 0.01 0.01 1.65 −0.02 0.02 −0.02 −1.72  Gsaddle =  −0.08 −0.81 1.48 −0.81 0.77 −2.30 1.60 −2.49 8.24  By considering the signs of diagonal components of elas- tic dipole tensor for the initial state, the direction of the gray arrows in Figs. 1-b and 1-c are justiﬁed.

Due to computational limitations, we do not compare the two methods for the longitudinal stain, however, we postulate that the good agreement observed for the xy- plane strain is also established for the z-axis strain.

It can also be seen that all curves behave linearly but with diﬀerent slopes between lateral and longitudinal strains (between red-blue and green plots). By applying a positive strain, the energy barrier decreases and vice versa, which is also in agreement with pre- vious results from Ning et. al. [23]. It can be seen that, as a result of tensile strain, there is more Li-Li separation and less Li-Li repulsion and therefore, moving Li atom can inter- calate/deintercalate more easily. From another point of view, applying strain could disturb the octahedrals orientation and therefore aﬀects the potential energy surface which directly inﬂuences the energy barrier. Since we see a good agreement between two methods in Fig. 8 for the lateral strain, we also plotted the eﬀect of lon- gitudinal strain on the migration energy barrier which is indi- cated with green color. It is clear from Fig. 8 that the longi- tudinal strain has a much stronger eﬀect on the energy barrier, compared to lateral strain. Therefore, this shows that instead of signiﬁcant computational eﬀorts due to performing NEB calculations at each strain regime, it is possible to use Eq. 8 and obtain the same results with much less computational re- sources. A comparison between Figs. 6 and 8 also indicates that the eﬀect of lateral (xy-plane) strain on the Li vacancy formation and migration are opposite of each other. This means that, while a lateral compressive strain decreases the energy barrier (due to above mentioned reasons), the same strain results in a larger Li vacancy formation energy. However, as can be seen from the plots, this eﬀect on formation and migration energy is not equal. Therefore in the activation energy, which is the sum of formation and migration, at a lateral strain regime equals to +1%, for example, the migration term is decreased by 0.04", "page": 7, "position": 1}

Therefore in the activation energy, which is the sum of formation and migration, at a lateral strain regime equals to +1%, for example, the migration term is decreased by 0.04 eV while formation term is increased by 0.02 eV. Thus, at this strain value, the overall trend is a decrease in the activation energy by 0.02 eV. Considering the relation of diﬀusivity, D ≈exp \u0012 −∆GA kBT \u0013 , decreasing of 0.02 eV in activation energy leads to almost ﬁve times increase in the diﬀusivity and hence the conduc- tivity. Therefore, the massive strain eﬀect on ionic conductiv- ity in bulk LiCoO2 is evident. We again note that the eﬀect of longitudinal strain is even more dominant than the lateral one. Particularly, only 1% strain along the z-axis can change the conductivity up to ten times compared to unstrained case. Moreover, according to theoretical ﬁndings [36], 4-5% and experimental evidences [29, 30], 2-3% strain is expected dur- ing the lithiation/delithiation of LiCoO2 to Li0.5CoO2. There- fore, strain ﬁelds can signiﬁcantly inﬂuence the ionic conduc- tivity in bulk LiCoO2 which shows that it can be employed to tune the particle mobility in battery materials. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS In summary, we have performed a detailed comparison for the variations of defect formation and migration energies with respect to strain in bulk LiCO2 using (i) direct evaluation of strained supercells (at each strain regime separately) and (ii) classical elasticity theory by computing the elastic dipole ten- sor (Gi j). The latter method requires only three DFT calcula- tions (pristine and defected cells for formation energies plus defected cell in transition state for energy barriers) for evalu- ation of both formation and migration energies to obtain the full variations as a function of any strain state. We found that the calculated formation energies using the elastic dipole tensor method deviate slightly when they are", "page": 7, "position": 2}

We also highlight that estimating the elastic dipole tensor in the dilute limit can be aﬀected by ﬁnite-size eﬀects and cou- pling between the stress components. Moreover, we found that the contribution of migration energy to the total activa- tion energy when a lateral strain regime is applied, is more dominant than the contribution of formation energy. Finally, we can conclude that the eﬀect of even small strains on ionic transport properties in bulk LiCoO2 is very signiﬁcant. We showed that only 1% in-plane strain can change the conductiv- ity by a factor of 5, while the presence of out-of-plane strains can change the conductivity by an order of magnitude.
