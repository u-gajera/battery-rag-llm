O’Regan1 1School of Physics, Trinity College Dublin, The University of Dublin, Dublin 2, Ireland (Dated: December 6, 2023) High-performance batteries, heterogeneous catalysts and next-generation photovoltaics often cen- trally involve transition metal oxides (TMOs) that undergo charge or spin-state changes. Demand for accurate DFT modeling of TMOs has increased in recent years, driving improved quantiﬁcation and correction schemes for approximate DFT’s characteristic errors, notably those pertaining to self- interaction and static correlation. Of considerable interest, meanwhile, is the use of DFT-accessible quantities to compute parameters of coarse-grained models such as for magnetism. To understand the interference of error corrections and model mappings, we probe the prototypical Mott-Hubbard insulator NiO, calculating its electronic structure in its antiferromagnetic I/II and ferromagnetic states. We examine the pronounced sensitivity of the ﬁrst principles calculated Hubbard parame- ters U and J to choices concerning Projector Augmented Wave (PAW) based population analysis, we reevaluate spin quantiﬁcation conventions for the Heisenberg model, and we seek to develop best practices for calculating Hubbard parameters speciﬁc to energetically meta-stable magnetic orderings of TMOs. Within this framework, we assess several corrective functionals using in situ calculated U and J parameters, e.g., DFT+U and DFT+U+J. We ﬁnd that while using a straight- forward workﬂow with minimal empiricism, the NiO Heisenberg parameter RMS error with respect to experiment was reduced to 13%, an advance upon the state-of-the-art. Methodologically, we used a linear-response implementation for calculating the Hubbard U available in the open-source plane-wave DFT code Abinit. We have extended its utility to calculate the intra-atomic exchange coupling J, however our ﬁndings are anticipated to be applicable to any DFT+U implementation.

INTRODUCTION Antiferromagnetic transition metal oxides (TMOs) are increasingly vital constituents of many technologies, from high-performance battery cathodes,1–5 to water-splitting catalysts,6,7 to eﬃcient photovoltaic devices for sustain- able energy storage.8–10 Understanding the macroscopic magnetic properties of this class of material requires a sophisticated description of the competing spin-related energy scales relevant at microscopic scales. A variety of simulation techniques exist to calculate the material properties of TMOs, such as DMFT,11–14 quan- tum Monte Carlo15–18 and coupled cluster methods.19–21 Each method comes with its own strengths and weak- nesses, regimes of applicability, and computational cost and scaling. For example, among the more computa- tionally inexpensive of such techniques is density func- tional theory (DFT), a popular electronic structure method that predicts material properties from ﬁrst prin- ciples. However, it is well-documented that approxi- mate DFT struggles to accurately describe the strongly correlated electron systems for which the TMO class is prototypical.22–28 By strongly correlated, in this context, we refer to the poor description of the electronic struc- ture associated with localized subspaces within the local (LDA) and semi-local (GGA) mean-ﬁeld approximations to the XC energy functional.29 This results from the chal- ∗lmacenul@tcd.ie lenge of describing exchange and correlation eﬀects with only a local or semi-local functional dependence, and based on a single-determinant reference system.25,26,30–32 Chief among the characteristic errors in the available computationally tractable local or semi-local approxi- mate functionals22–24 is the self-interaction error (SIE), that is the spurious exposure of an electron to its own Coulombic potential, and more broadly, the many-body SIE or delocalization error, a tendency to artiﬁcially dif- fuse the electron density.25–28,33 Less discussed, but no less pervasive, is the static-correlation error (SCE) that particularly arises in degenerate and multi-valence sys- tems and, more generally, in systems of signiﬁcant multi- reference character. Computationally inexpensive techniques that may be interepreted as rectifying SIE, speciﬁcally, include the Hubbard-like corrective functionals.

Many readily-available DFT programs have an imple- mentation of DFT+U in diﬀerent guises, however rela- tively few among them have utilities for calculating the Hubbard parameters from ﬁrst principles. In prepara- tion for the present work, we analysed in detail the nu- merical performance of a linear-response implementation for calculating the Hubbard U that is embedded in the Projector Augmented Wave (PAW)41 functionality of the open-source plane-wave DFT package Abinit.42,43 Fur- thermore, we extended its capability to also calculate the parameter Jz from ﬁrst principles. Our technical work here has led to the development of what is now called the Abinit LRUJ utility.44 Within the context of Hubbard-corrected DFT, much scientiﬁc attention is directed towards understanding the eﬀect of the corrective functionals and their parameters upon bond distances, band gap predictions,45–47 total en- ergy diﬀerences,48–54 and other parameterized spectro- scopic properties. Meanwhile, comparatively few studies have probed how DFT+U(+J) and related functionals impact metrics of magnetism, such as the magnetic ex- change parameters in the Heisenberg model.54,55 When calculated using total energy diﬀerences, these parame- ters become valid ground state DFT quantities, and they thereby become concise indicators of the reliability of DFT+U(+J) total energies. Magnetic exchange param- eters thus constitute expedient indicators of the quality of ﬁrst-principle DFT+U(+J) total energy diﬀerences, which are often supposed to be within the method’s regime of reliable applicability, albeit without much con- crete literature evidence of that to date. It is essential, and even more so due to its widespread adoption, to work to establish the regime of reliability of ﬁrst-principles for DFT+U(+J) total-energy diﬀerences, and to explore and delineate its remaining weaknesses and ambiguities. For these reasons, and given this context, we undertook a multi-pronged investigation designed to systematize the complexities of the magnetic Heisenberg model, ﬁrst- principles Hubbard corrective functionals, intra-atomic spin parametrization schema, and the PAW method for the prototypical antiferromagnetic TMO, nickel oxide (NiO).", "page": 1, "position": 0}

Following a working description of our methodology in Section II, we examine, in Section III A, the sensitivity of the in situ calculated Hubbard parameters U and Jz with respect to the available charge population analyses of the PAW method. With Hubbard parameters deﬁned, we map selected points in the energy-magnetization landscape of bulk NiO onto the classical Heisenberg model by calcu- lating its electronic structure in its three main sta- ble, meta-stable or enforceable magnetic conﬁgura- tions (AFI—antiferromagnetic in the [001] direction, AFII—antiferromagnetic in the [111] direction, and fer- romagnetic (FM); see Figure 1). We extract Heisenberg (inter-atomic) exchange coupling parameters in terms of strict density-functional accessible total energy diﬀer- ences between these magnetic conﬁgurations. In Sections III B and III C, we explore the potential of incorporating not only total energies but also local mo- ments in the mapping onto the Heisenberg model, and we assess several diﬀerent ways to perform this.

We relay this comparative analysis in Sections III D-III F, ﬁnishing with a closer look at the eﬀect of Hubbard treatment on the O-2p sites in Section III G. A. NiO As a ﬁrst-row transition metal harboring several ac- cessible oxidation states, nickel is a relevant candidate for many sustainable technologies. Its monoxide, NiO, is promising as a p-type semiconductor with multiple technological applications, such as in photocathodes,56–58 lithium-ion battery cathodes for vehicles,59 OH- carrier battery cathodes for portable electronics,60 eﬃciency en- hancers in solar cells,61 among others. It is relatively non-toxic, has a wide and tunable band gap (around 3.5- 4.0 eV),61–64 and is relative stable. NiO crystallizes above the N´eel temperature (523 K) in the rocksalt structure (space group Fm3m) with an experimental lattice parameter consistently estimated at around 4.17 ˚A (7.88 a0) across a variety of diﬀraction studies.65–73 Other experiments indicate that Ni sites in bulk NiO take on magnetic moments between 1.96 µB70 and 2.2 µB.73–76 While under certain conditions the TMO can be observed in many magnetic orderings, its ground state magnetic ordering (MO) is AFII, the iso- magnetic planes of which alternate antiferromagnetically in the [111] direction (see schematic in Figure 1).65–67 NiO AFI and FM magnetic states yield experimental lat- tice parameters of 4.168 and 4.171 ˚A, respectively.77 Bulk NiO is a well-studied system with a wealth of literature attesting to its total energy diﬀerence param- eters. Its status as the prototypical Mott-Hubbard in- sulator renders NiO a good benchmark system through which to observe the eﬀect of SIE corrective techniques on total energies.

Although all electronic subspaces are aﬄicted with SIE to some extent, not all are treated with Hubbard correc- tions, only those with some occupancy matrix eigenval- ues signiﬁcantly deviating from integer values and, cor- respondingly, spectral weight adjacent to the band-gap edges. Strictly speaking, many-body SIE is uniquely de- ﬁned at present only for open quantum systems in their totality, and partitioning by subspaces implies that prag- matic choices are being made. The original derivations of DFT+U considered the en- ergy, EHub, associated with the Hubbard model and a single-determinant assumption for the wave-function, to- gether with a double counting term, Edc, for such a component of the latter that may be already included in the underlying Hartree and XC energy. The double- counting correction is usually considered to be dependent solely on N iσ, the total electron occupation of each sub- spaces and spin component. The exact form of Edc is not precisely known, a consequence of the fact that the XC constituent of the Kohn-Sham Hamiltonian is mutu- ally unknown.

This formulation of DFT+U makes it obvious that the corrective terms preceded by the Hubbard parameters penalize fractional occupation of atomic orbitals, for pos- itive Ui eﬀvalues. When an eigenvalue of niσ assumes an integer value, the corresponding contribution to EU is zero. By contrast, when that eigenvalue is maximally fractionalized at 0.5, the contribution to EU is also max- imized. In Eq. (2), the eﬀective parameter is Ueﬀ= U −Jz, where U is the Hubbard parameter and Jz is the intra- atomic exchange parameter, more often denoted J but re- named here merely to avoid confusion with inter-atomic Heisenberg parameters. The degree of corrective power of the functional, then, is determined by the magnitudes of U and Jz. In the literature, Ueﬀand U are often ref- erenced interchangeably depending on the consideration given to Jz.83 An alternative and more elaborate func- tional that we reference here as DFT+U+Jz, in which Jz is not simply a mitigator of U, is described in Liecht- enstein et al.84 For atomic s-orbitals, the Liechtenstein functional reduces to the Dudarev functional of Eq.

This for vector spin S, either on a per-spatial-orbital or per-atomic-subspace basis, depending on the preferred deﬁnition as opposed to its z-axis projection Sz. It is further worth noting that, based on recent investigations into the suitability of DFT+U-like functionals in correcting SIE and SCE, the two functionals used here, when applied to s-orbitals including terms proportional to a positive-valued ﬁrst- principles Jz, do not succeed in correcting for SCE and may even increase the magnitude of SCE.36 Which Hubbard functional, and which subspaces re- quire numerical attention in excess of the underlying XC functional, are both topical inquiries that this ar- ticle does not directly address for NiO. For the pur- poses of brevity, we restrict our assessment to DFT+U, DFT+Ueﬀand DFT+U+Jz, built upon the Perdew- Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) GGA85 XC functional. We ﬁrst test the eﬀect of these functionals when in situ treat- ment is administered to the Ni 3d orbitals alone (requir- ing calculation and application of Ud and Jd z).

When prop- erly calculated, the Hubbard parameters are expected to appropriately set the strength of the corrective function- als and precisely cancel the systematic errors character- istic of approximate DFT.80,86,87 Many methodologies for the in situ calculation of the Hubbard U parameter exist, such as Minimum Tracking Linear Response,88,89 the constrained Random Phase Approximation (cRPA),90,91 and the more recent methodology based on density functional perturbation theory (DFPT),92 to name a few. We focus here on the method from Cococcioni and de Gironcoli,37 who, follow- ing from the work of Pickett et al.,87 developed a practi- cal protocol for calculating U from ﬁrst-principles called the Self-Consistent Field (SCF) Linear Response method. This method eliminates reliance on external empirical data and paves the road for more accurate simulations of obscure or yet-to-be discovered materials. We refer the reader to these references for a more comprehensive picture of the theory and the mathematical formalism behind the SCF linear response.37,87,93–95 The SCF linear response approach begins with the ap- plication of a small, uniform perturbation to the external potential of the subspace for which U is under assessment. The change in electronic occupation induced by that per- turbation is then monitored. The occupancy response is, for small perturbations, ordinarily expected to be a linear function of the perturbation’s magnitude. Formulated practicably, the SCF linear response pro- cedure for calculating U is as follows.35,89 To begin, we converge a calculation to the ground state. We then in- dividually (in parallel restarts) apply several weak per- turbations of strength {α} in equal magnitude to the up and down spin channels of the external potential. In the basis of the orbitals that deﬁne the subspace i, this con- tribution to the external potential, V i,σ mm′, is deﬁned in terms of the subspace projection", "page": 3, "position": 1}

(3) Here, P i mm′ is replaced by ˜P i mm′ via Eq. (11) in the PAW case, which may be approximated in diﬀerent ways as we later discuss. Once the potential perturbation is applied, but before the density is calculated and the Hamiltonian updated to start the new iteration, the spin-up and spin- down charge occupations on the perturbed atom change in response. Next, we must distinguish between the interacting response and the response arising from a conjectured system in which electrons do not interact (i.e., one with Kohn-Sham (KS) energy).80,93,96 Within this sys- tem, we’re interested only in the change in total non- interacting occupation (n↑ 0 + n↓ 0) of subspace S with re- spect to α, which we call the non-interacting response function, χ0, deﬁned as χ0 = d(n↑ 0 + n↓ 0) dα . (4) We harvest n↑ 0 and n↓ 0, the non-interacting spin-up and spin-down occupations, respectively, after the ﬁrst self- consistent iteration. The system then attempts to screen the perturbation, eﬀectively compensating for the distur- bance by reorganising its charge once again until, after the last self-consistent iteration, it reaches an equilibrium state. The derivative of this equilibrium occupation with respect to the perturbation magnitude is the interacting response function, χ = d(n↑+ n↓) dα , (5) where n↑and n↓are the ground state occupations of S harvested after the last self-consistent iteration. Finally, we invert the response functions and take their diﬀerence", "page": 3, "position": 2}

(6) The linearity condition manifests primarily in the na- ture of χ and χ0 as functions. However, the response behavior is not always linear. Figure 2 demonstrates this for an exceptionally ill-behaved system. With some ex- ceptions, linearity is expected in the limit of small pertur- bations, but this region does not always exist, particu- larly when the response is excessively hard (e.g., close to full ﬁlling). If the perturbations are too large, of course one can generally expect some non-linear behav- ior. Non-linearity, and sometimes asymmetry across the zero-perturbation axis, is also expected if the system has a particularly shallow energy landscape, (that is, when the response is excessively soft, e.g., close to a phase tran- sition).

Ideally, U is calculated for a cell of inﬁnite size such that the perturbed subspace is isolated from its peri- odic images.

We test and discuss this point in Section III D. C. PAW-based population analysis The special ingredient in both the linear response de- termination of the Hubbard parameters as well as their host corrective functionals is the subspace occupation matrix niσ and its elements {niσ mm′}. The DFT+U(±Jz) occupation matrix elements are deﬁned as niσ mm′ = X k,v f σ kv⟨ψσ kv|φi m′⟩⟨φi m|ψσ kv⟩, (9) where ψσ kv is the Kohn-Sham (KS) orbital corresponding to k-point k and band index v, φi m is the localized basis function assigned to magnetic quantum number m on atom i, and f σ kv is the Fermi-Dirac distribution function applied to the KS orbitals. The machinery that isolates charged subspaces for pop- ulation analysis are the projector functions. The occupa- tion matrix in Eq. (9) is a generalized projection of the KS density matrix onto a localized basis set of choice, where that choice is typically limited by the options made available by the developers of the DFT+U(±Jz) imple- mentation at hand. Reliance on projector functions that are unsuitable reﬂections of the correct localization, ei- ther by excessive localization, unphysical discontinuities, or by excessive overlap,100 will result in erroneous popula- tion analysis and, by consequence, ineﬃcient or otherwise defective corrective protocol.37 In Abinit, the DFT+U(±Jz) formalism is built into the program’s Projector Augmented Wave (PAW)41 functionality, so the population analysis relies heavily on the PAW projectors.

That is eP i mm′ = P i mm′ + X IJ |epI⟩⟨φI|P i mm′|φJ⟩⟨epJ| (11) − X IJ |epI⟩⟨eφI|P i mm′|eφJ⟩⟨epJ|, where I is a shorthand index assigned to sets of (i, ℓi, mℓi, ni), which respectively refer to the site index, angular quantum number, magnetic quantum number, and PAW partial-wave index. Similarly, an analogous set of numbers (j, ℓj, mℓj, nj) pertains to a diﬀerent site J. When Eq. (11) is inserted into Eq.

Care must be taken in selecting an appropriate projector, as the selection can have far-reaching numerical implications.101–106 Four PAW occupation matrix projector options are available in Abinit. For simplicity and ease of refer- ence, we refer to each option by the integer value of its Abinit input ﬁle variable, dmatpuopt (Density MATrix for PAW+U OPTion), which may take on values one through four.107 When dmatpuopt=1, occupations are projections on atomic orbitals,43 per the deﬁnition ni,σ m,m′ = X IJ ρσ IJ ⟨φni|φ0⟩ φ0 φnj , (14) where φ0 are normalized, bound state atomic eigenfunc- tions pertaining to PAW partial wave index ni = 1, drawn from the list of AE wavefunctions pertaining to the subspace in question.108 Importantly, the integrals ⟨φni|φ0⟩and ⟨φ0|φnj⟩are computed within the PAW aug- mentation sphere.", "page": 5, "position": 2}

When dmatpuopt=4, both the φ0 and the part of the KS orbital falling inside the aug- mentation sphere are supposedly renormalized (only if the KS orbital matches the atomic orbital in shape), so that N0 is squared in the denominator.

More information is provided in Section II D. bly occupied quantum states. Exchange in the intra- atomic short-range, by contrast, leads to Hund’s rules and is several orders of magnitude stronger than its in- teratomic counterpart.114 The exchange coupling param- eters between magnetic atom centers, Jij, can be consid- ered spin-based measures of repulsion between electrons on neighboring atoms. When Jij > 0, a ferromagnetic in- teraction is preferred, meaning the atoms will adopt the same spin orientation, while Jij < 0 indicates the atomic spins would rather oppose each other in an antiferromag- netic ordering. We consider two exchange parameters (refer to the in- set in Figure 3 for visualization) following Refs. [115– 117] . The ﬁrst is exchange between nearest neighbor (NN) Ni atoms (J1), wherein the overlap of the t2g states of the 3d orbitals on NN Ni atoms gives rise to a strongly AF direct exchange. This antiferromagnetic disposition is mitigated, however, by a primarily FM 90◦-oriented indirect exchange, also known as superexchange. This round-the-corner exchange mechanism is strongly medi- ated by the intra-atomic Coulomb exchange between or- thogonal 2p orbitals on the pivotal oxygen atom. The schematic in Figure 3 illustrates why we expect this su- perexchange to favor ferromagnetic alignment. Overall, we expect the FM superexchange to overpower the AF direct exchange, meaning that J1 will adopt a positive value overall. The schematic in Figure 3 also illustrates why we ex- pect J2, a quantiﬁer of next-nearest neighbor (NNN) ex- change interactions separated by 180◦, to adopt a pro- foundly negative value, indicating strong preference for AF alignment. With these phenomena in mind, we map the electronic Hamiltonian onto the Heisenberg model and look at J1 and J2 of NiO.

Spin Parametrization and Magnetic Moment An electron with quantum numbers (n,ℓ,mℓ,ms) will have spin magnetic moment µs = −geµBs, where ge ≈ 2.002318 is the g-factor for a free electron and µB = eℏ 2m = 1 2 [a.u.] is the Bohr magneton.119,120 The to- tal spin magnetic moment is the sum of spin magnetic moments of all electrons on that atom µS = −geµBS (where S is the summation over electrons).120,121 Refer- encing atomic magnetic moments in units of µB, then, S [µB] = −µS/ge. In atomic units, S [a.u.] = −2µS/ge. Conventionally, the Si of Eq. (19) are considered (a) projections (Sz)i of the quantum spin vector Si on the quantization axis, and (b) of unit magnitude in accor- dance with nickel’s expected oxidation state of +2, corre- sponding to an atomic magnetic moment of +2 µB (= 1 in atomic units, hence µ2 S ≈1). We seek to reevaluate these conventions given the multitude of DFT-accessible population analyses that can inﬂuence, to a large degree, the predicted magnetic moment on Ni atoms. For example, in Section II C, we found that the PAW population analysis extends naturally to a deﬁnition of the magnetic moment that is both atom-centered and restricted to the augmentation sphere. That is, for mag- netic centers, we take (SAS z )i = Z rc |r|=0 (ρ↑(Ri + r) −ρ↓(Ri + r)) dr. (22) However, because the PAW augmentation spheres do not envelop all the charge in the system, leaving some interstitial charge uncounted, this option is expected to produce moments smaller than expected. We may ad- dress this by normalizing the subspace occupations via the projector, as in Section II C, and calculating (SPAW z )i = X m ni,↑ m,m −ni,↓ m,m, (23) which, by consequence, encodes the choice of PAW pro- jectors described in Section II C.", "page": 8, "position": 0}

Alternatively, we may obtain magnetic moments via the extraction of Sz from the entire spin density (SD), by using (SSD z )i = 1 NNi Z |ρ↑(r) −ρ↓(r)| dr, (24) where NNi is the number of Ni atoms in the system. While it produces larger magnetic moments, this method is accompanied by the particular limitation that the atom-speciﬁc magnetic moments are no longer resolved, and any moments formed near the oxygen atoms are ab- sorbed into those of the magnetic centers. It is conven- tional in the relevant literature to consider oxygen atoms as mere extensions or mediators of the magnetic charac- ter of the TM magnetic centers, thereby restricting as- sessment of exchange interactions to those between Ni atoms. A similar study conducted by Logemann et al.116 investigates the appropriateness of this convention. In using Eq. (24), we follow this study. It should be noted, however, that the Heisenberg Hamiltonian in Eq. (19) calls for the use of the quantum spin vectors Si, as opposed to their scalar and DFT- accessible counterparts, the expectation values of the z- axis projection of the spin angular momentum Sz. Sup- pose we instead consider an approximate quantum model in which |S| = q ⟨S2⟩. Coupling the spins on each mag- netic site such that s = 1 for the two unpaired spins on Ni together, the expectation value of the spin angular momentum of an atomic system is |S| = q ⟨S2⟩= ℏ p s(s + 1)Sz (25) = √ 2 Sz [a.u.].

That is, in a sort of crude quantum approximation, we scale the DFT-accessible magnetic moments, which may be thought of as time-averages of precessing, canted spins, by a factor of √ 2. To our knowledge, this approx- imation has been made to magnetic properties in other contexts—such as in the works of Harrison,122 Kotani et al,123 and Wan et al 124—but not tested systematically against other DFT-accessible spin objects for NiO. Once we settle on an appropriate treatment of the spin vector, we can examine how it factors into the numerical calculation of the exchange coupling parameters. Eqs. (20) and (21) can be considered simpliﬁcations of a more generalized set of total energy diﬀerence equations un- der the Heisenberg model, derived by considering all NN and NNN of one Ni atom (or Ni-O pair) in the cell. They are solutions to a system of linear equations mapping the total energy of each MO onto the Heisenberg model, so- lutions that simplify when we impose assumptions that the spin magnetic moments of all atoms are a) integers and b) the same regardless of the cell’s magnetic environ- ment. That is, the magnitudes of the atomic magnetic moments are |SFM| = |SAFI| = |SAFII| = 1 in EFM = E0 −12J1S2 FM −6J2S2 FM (26) EAFI = E0 + 4J1S2 AFI −6J2S2 AFI EAFII = E0 + 6J2S2 AFII . Suppose we assume instead that |SFM| ̸= |SAFI| ̸= |SAFII| ̸= 1. Since DFT uses the non-integer spin degree of freedom to deepen the total energy well of each MO, and since that relaxed magnetization is accessible, we can perhaps explicitly use the ﬁnal magnetization to better weight the energetic contributions of each MO to the ex- change coeﬃcients. Then the system of linear equations in Eqs. (26), solved for J1 and J2, becomes125", "page": 8, "position": 2}

Exchange coupling parameters that incorporate diﬀer- ences in magnetization across MOs are not immediately comparable to those reported in previous works. We ﬁnd this is not so much an artefact of the assumption that |SFM| = |SAFI| = |SAFII| = σ (where σ is a constant) so much as it reﬂects the assumption that σ = 1. As a comparative intermediary, therefore, we look at the ex- change interaction parameters when the sum of electrons in a Ni atom corresponds directly to the magnitude of the Ni magnetic moment in the ground state magnetic con- ﬁguration of NiO (i.e., when σ2 = S2 AFII [a.u.]). Under this approach, Eqs. (27) and (28) reduce to J1 = 1 16 S2 AFII (EAFI −EFM) , and (29) J2 = 1 48 S2 AFII (4EAFII −3EAFI −EFM) .

Furthermore, we seek to understand if total energy diﬀerences between MOs are most comparable when calculated using Hubbard parameters that are (a) speciﬁc to each MO, or (b) the same across MOs.

PAW Projectors and the Hubbard Parameters Switching between PAW population analysis schemes induces noticeable numerical diﬀerences in the resulting Hubbard parameters for both Ni 3d orbitals and O 2p orbitals (see Table III). It is encouraging that the un- screened response functions χ0 and χM0, pertaining to each projector choice, are reasonably alike. This is ex- pected in accordance with the Corollary in Appendix A. The Hubbard parameters U and Jz resulting from dmatpuopt=2 and dmatpuopt=3 are consistently similar, whereas dmatpuopt=1 yields the largest in magnitude of these parameters and dmatpuopt=4 yields the smallest. These phenomena are concordant with", "page": 10, "position": 0}

The Hubbard parameters U and Jz resulting from dmatpuopt=2 and dmatpuopt=3 are consistently similar, whereas dmatpuopt=1 yields the largest in magnitude of these parameters and dmatpuopt=4 yields the smallest. These phenomena are concordant with our understand- ing of the make-up of the response matrices. That is, extrapolations of occupancies beyond the PAW radius increase the overall occupancy (magnetization), thereby decreasing the inverse of the response matrices and re- ducing U (Jz). For Ni, which has well-localized valence electrons, the range of Hubbard parameters is not very wide; by our calculations, 90.47% of the 3d atomic wave functions lie inside the PAW augmentation sphere. For O 2p orbitals, however, this overlap is signiﬁcantly smaller, around 66.87%, and thus the range of achievable Hub- bard parameters by various population analysis schemes is signiﬁcantly larger for O than for Ni. It is impor- tant, therefore, in treating O 2p-orbitals, to select an occupancy matrix calculation scheme that is normalized inside the PAW augmentation sphere. In terms of numerical similarity with the Quan- tum ESPRESSO-derived U, only dmatpuopt=2 and dmatpuopt=3 remain viable candidates, with dmatpuopt=2 barely outperforming dmatpuopt=3 based on numerical nuances. Not only does dmatpuopt=4 systematically underestimate U, from a theoretical standpoint (described in Section II C), using the inte- gral of φ0 to renormalize the AE basis function is an approximation that is not entirely justiﬁed. While the ﬁrst AE partial wave listed in a PAW dataset for a particular treated subspace, which Abinit selects as φ0, is required to be a normalized atomic eigenfunction, the second (or third or fourth, etc.) AE basis functions have no such constraints. There’s no guarantee that these functions are localized in the PAW augmentation region to the same extent as φ0.

All in all, dmatpuopt=3 outperforms its competitor in three of the four aforementioned metrics ((b), (c) and (d), to be precise). There is a case to be made in opposition to dmatpuopt=2 from a theoretical standpoint. Its projec- tion operator, Eq. (16), is deﬁned using a Heaviside step function, which operationally “counts,” so to speak, the overlap between two PAW radial basis functions by brute-force. The ground state eigenfunction basis for dmatpuopt=3 is underpinned by the same assumptions and approximations that are used in the deﬁnition of the bound PAW AE partial waves. The renormalization of projections of all partial waves with a bounded, truncated AE wavefunction reintroduces a crucial, physics-based safeguard into the deﬁnition of the occupancy matrix. For this reason, we select dmatpuopt=3 as our preferred PAW population analysis. We report the Hubbard pa- rameters pertaining to this population analyisis scheme as well as their associated errors in Table IV. B. Intra-atomic spin moment Having fossilized the in situ Hubbard parameters, we must give due consideration to the most appropriate Hubbard functional (among the six tested using the AFII HPs), intra-atomic spin moment calculation (AS, PAW or SD, permutated across Sz and |S|), and MO-based spin parametrization method (Methods A, B, or C). Ta- ble I of the Supplemental Material (SM) provides all of this raw data. To make the process of elimination sim- pler, however, we’ll focus on identifying the most eﬀec- tive combination of spin treatments by averaging across all six Hubbard functionals the percent RMS deviation (% RMSE) of our results for J1 and J2 from those of one particular experiment (exp), speciﬁcally % RMSE = v", "page": 11, "position": 1}

The preferable MO-based spin parametrization method depends crucially on the use of the quantum vec- tor over the z-axis projection; under the latter treatment, Method A obtains exchange parameters more in line with experiment by a clear margin, indicating a preference for total energy diﬀerences with idealized spin-moment val- ues. By contrast, if the magnetic moments are ampliﬁed by a factor of √ 2 as with the quantum vector approxima- tion, Methods B and C, which weight the total energies from each MO according to various combinations of their atomic magnetic moments, win out. To understand this behaviour, we recall that DFT- derived Ni magnetic moments on AF NiO do not typ- ically exceed 2 µB (see Figure 4 (a)), meaning that the coeﬃcients by which the AF total energies are weighted exceed unity, thereby amplifying the total energy diﬀer- ences to which the exchange interaction parameters are proportional.

For this reason, we see that a rela- tively underestimated population analysis, like that com- ing from AS, coupled with the overestimation attributed to the √ 2 factor from |S| can balance out to yield mini- mized errors. This explanation, of course, is not a glowing testimo- nial for either technique, especially since SAS z performs rather poorly compared to its PAW and SD counter- parts. However, the results in and of themselves, inde- pendent of their justiﬁcation, oﬀer concrete, actionable insights to the reader in terms of which spin treatment is best for NiO exchange. Certainly, Table V oﬀers more organized navigation of a few available DFT-tractable, spin-based objects and their inﬂuence on the Heisen- berg exchange constants, and the numerical forgiveness awarded by these techniques should not be overlooked. For the purposes of further analysis, therefore, we take Table V at its face value and both select and recommend |SAS| = √ 2 SAS z as the preferred intra-atomic spin mo- ment calculation method.

It should be clariﬁed that we use RMS error in Tables V, VI, and VII as a measure of proximity to the reported values of the four diﬀerent experiments cited.

All Hubbard functionals we tested produced exchange coupling parameters that are highly competitive with those from other investigations. Generally, however, the literature reports a wide range of values for this partic- ular magnetic property, in part due to large variation in calculation of the magnetic moments (approximately half use some form of the total spin density diﬀerence inte- grals, others use atom-centered sphere integration up to inconsistent maximum radii; all use Sz). Only a few com- putations use PAW, and many calculate the exchange coeﬃcients with methods other than that involving to- tal energy diﬀerences. It is crucial to recognize that the variation in spin moment integrations severely limits the reliability of any comparison across works of literature, and it is these incongruities in procedure that reinforce our inclination to benchmark with experiment. Now for the analysis; referencing Tables V and VI, for converged total energies and their corresponding mag- netic moments, we ﬁnd that spin parametrization Meth- ods B and C generally predict exchange interaction values smaller in magnitude, and closer to experiment, than the method that uses idealized values for Ni magnetization. This much is also demonstrated by the curves (the ex- change parameters as functions of AFII Ud variation) in Figures 4 (c) and (d) as Ud approaches its in situ values of Ud = 5.58 eV and Ud eﬀ= 5.11 eV.

That much is also evident in the % RMSE in Row 1 of Table V. The same AS data demonstrate a slight preference for Method B over Method C, however, the diﬀerence is minute. The same conclusions cannot be drawn from Table VII. While J2 is consistently smallest in magnitude under Method C, J1 actually performs best under Method A. This is consistent with our own data, recalling that the literature analyzed here exclusively calculates the mag- netic moment as a projection on the z-axis, whereas val- ues from our own Hubbard functionals reported in Ta- ble VI use SAS as per the conclusions of Section III B. If we better align our calculations with the literature by using SAS z , we can see from Table V that indeed, Method A minimizes the error compared to the other spin parametrization methods.

These performed poorly, not only quantitatively—note the inﬂated % RMS error scale, dilated by two orders of magnitude—but qualitatively, as they failed to predict the correct mag- netic alignment for J1. This decisively answers the query posed earlier; while the U and Jz for a particular sub- space in FM NiO diﬀer from those calculated for other MOs (see Tables III and IV), the total energies resulting from the application of these magnetic ordering-speciﬁc parameters to their corresponding system are not neces- sarily comparable to one another. We must emphasize, however, that this will not necessarily be the case for any and all Hubbard functionals; there remain quite a few functionals untested in this article, and further test- ing is needed to determine if this ineptitude is an intrisinc property of Hubbard corrective protocol. This conclusion is somewhat unexpected. The MO of a particular material system inﬂuences the magnitude of its atomic magnetic moments, as is demonstrated in Figures 4 (a) and (b). These moments are direct func- tions of valence subspace occupations, and so changing the magnetic moments in turn alters the amount of self- interaction intrinsic to each subspace and, therefore, the Hubbard parameters and the eﬃcacy of their host Hub- bard functionals. If the total energies of each system are individually more accurate by application of a Hubbard corrective functional, then is it not expected that the total energy diﬀerences between these systems become more accurate, as well?

If the total energies of each system are individually more accurate by application of a Hubbard corrective functional, then is it not expected that the total energy diﬀerences between these systems become more accurate, as well? The linearity condition of linear response is based heav- ily on the quadratic nature of SIE (i.e., the deviation from piece-wise linearity of the total energy with respect to fractional charge). It is worth noting, however, that the response behavior in the ﬁrst-principles calculation of the Hubbard parameters for certain Ni 3d subspaces— notably upon application of the beta perturbation to the FM and AFI MOs—noticeably deviated from linearity. This non-linear response suggests that the SIE in these systems may require a correction of order higher than quadratic, possibly as a result of the added complexity in enforcing the system’s non-ground state MOs. We might be tempted to conclude then that applying diﬀerent sets of Hubbard parameters to these systems is akin to changing its functional entirely, to the degree that the resulting total energies are no longer compara- ble (i.e., asserting that a DFT+Ud = 5.58 eV functional is inherently diﬀerent to a DFT+Ud = 6.91 eV func- tional). However, this justiﬁcation is not compatible with our understanding of the Hubbard parameters as intrin- sic, ground state properties of the degree to which SIE and SCE infect the system. In maintaining the integrity of this understanding, then, it is more plausible that we have simply not found/tested a Hubbard-like functional adequately equipped to deal with long-range magnetic ordering of this nature. In applying the same Hubbard parameters inside this particular set of functionals to all structures, its possible that the results beneﬁt from a black-box cancellation of errors that manifests in the to- tal energy diﬀerence domain.

E. Eﬀect of Hubbard functional choice Whatever ails the MO-speciﬁc functionals does not af- fect the Hubbard functionals employing only the AFII NiO parameters, in which the same Hubbard functionals are applied to all structures regardless of MO. Like PBE, these functionals correctly predict the preference for fer- romagnetic alignment in J1 and antiferromagnetic align- ment in J2. This remains true as long as the Hubbard pa- rameters are reasonable in magnitude, as demonstrated in Figures 4 (c) and (d); under the standard DFT+Ud functional, both the NN and the NNN exchange inter- actions gradually weaken with increasing Ud, coinciding with experimental values around the ﬁrst-principles value of Ud. In particular, the DFT+Ud eﬀyields J1 and J2 coef- ﬁcients strikingly in line with experimental values un- der the Method B spin parametrization, contributing to shared RMS errors ranging from 7.4% to 12.9%. It is closely followed in performance by the same functional under Method C spin parametrization (8.6-14.5% error), and then by the Liechtenstein DFT+Ud+Jd z functional— in which we apply both HPs to the Ni 3d subspace only–under Method B (11.0-16.9% error). This rank- ing remains stable even as the intra-atomic spin popula- tion analysis technique varies, although only when con- sidering |S|. When using instead Sz, the Liechtenstein DFT+Ud+Jd z under Method A performs best. The J1, J2 pairs from these Hubbard functionals are highly competitive with those from other semi-local or hybrid functionals reported in the literature. Looking back at Table VII, the best DFT prediction for J1 on NiO remains that from Fock-35 results of Ref. [135] , with an individual parameter RMS error of 8.7%.

At minimum, this demonstrates that the Hubbard functionals are competi- tive with the more costly hybrid functionals in achieving total energy diﬀerence results that reﬂect experiment. F. Mechanisms of Hubbard functional choice It is possible to rationalize the dependence of J1 and J2 on the choice of Hubbard functional and parameter strength in a relatively simple way. To see this, we start with the energy expressions for Method B, Eqs. (29) and (30). Taking the former, J1, we ﬁrst note that a suﬃcient Ud will change the FM and AFI systems from metallic to insulating. This will tend to reduce the relevant total energy diﬀerence; the total energy of the metallic state depends signiﬁcantly, through the kinetic energy, on the Fermi densities of the two systems, whereas in the insu- lating systems, it will primarily depend on weaker diﬀer- ences of exchange and correlation eﬀects. As we can see from Figure 4 (a), the local moments become more simi- lar in the two states at larger U values, which moderates the tendency for the diﬀerent Hubbard energy contribu- tions to increase. As these local moments increase with Ud, furthermore, so too the denominator in Eq. (29) in- creases quadratically, which further brings down the J1. Thus, we can visualize how increasing Ud tends to bring down the predicted J1. Of course, that eﬀect is moder- ated in the Dudarev scheme when Ud is reduced to Ud eﬀ by an increasing Jd z. Meanwhile, it is interesting that the exchange pa- rameters arising from DFT+Ud and the Liechtenstein DFT+Ud+Jd z are so similar. In fact, the similarity be- tween the exchange parameters arising from either func- tional is tenacious, remaining even as we vary Ud and Jd z (keeping the ﬁrst-principles ratio between Ud and Jd z constant). The relative agnosticism of the inter-atomic, Heisenberg exchange parameters to the addition of a non- zero Jz parameter suggests that the spin localization fa- cilitated by the Ud term is already quite robust. The addition of Up eﬀlargely mitigates the eﬀect of Ud eﬀon J1, and not in", "page": 17, "position": 0}

The relative agnosticism of the inter-atomic, Heisenberg exchange parameters to the addition of a non- zero Jz parameter suggests that the spin localization fa- cilitated by the Ud term is already quite robust. The addition of Up eﬀlargely mitigates the eﬀect of Ud eﬀon J1, and not in a beneﬁcial way when using the ﬁrst-principles parameters. We return to discuss this eﬀect further in the next section. As for the substantial moderation of J2 by the addition of Ud, the same arguments and trends largely hold. The total energy diﬀerences in Eq. (30) are reduced when all three systems are insulating. Once again, as the moments are increased with increasing Ud eﬀ, so the J2 decreases due to the quadratic expression in the denominator. This eﬀect is weakened by Jd z in the Dudarev functional, by deﬁnition, and beneﬁcially so when J2 is compared against experiment. The eﬀects of Jd z and Jp z are much more weak in the Liechtenstein functional, where it is also more diﬃcult to interpret. The main diﬀerence in the trends observed between J1 and J2 is a diﬀerent sign in the change with the addition of ﬁnite Up eﬀ, so that increasing Up eﬀreduces the magnitude of J2, as we go on to discuss further. Once again, however, the addition of the ﬁrst-principles Up eﬀis detrimental to the quality of J2. G. Eﬀect of Hubbard Parameters on Oxygen Introduction of HPs on the oxygen 2p orbitals, across all Hubbard functionals, seems to have the eﬀect of strengthening the NN ferromagnetic exchange while si- multaneously weakening the antiferromagnetic coupling between layers, similar to how HSE and PSIC per- form compared to raw PBE.115 For example, rela- tive to DFT+Ud+Jd z, the additional Up and Jp z in DFT+Ud,p+Jd,p z increase J1 to 1 meV, but bring J2 down in magnitude to −7.35 meV.

These are typically unwel- come modiﬁcations under Methods B and C, for both J1 and J2, since the latter is chronically underestimated by a large margin and the former hovers tightly around the experimental value of 0.69 eV. Nonetheless, the regularity of the phenomenon is in- triguing and worth some discussion. In the much sim- pliﬁed picture of Eq. (26), the spin dependence of the AFII total energy is informed exclusively by J2 interac- tions, and the FM total energy is informed heavily, al- though not exclusively, by J1 interactions. Moreover, as discussed in Section II D 1, the crystal ﬁeld splitting of orbitals is heavily implicated in the direct and superex- change mechanisms that collectively give rise to inter- atomic exchange. We can perhaps look for clues in the FM and AFII NiO density of states (DOS) plots, shown in Figure 5 as functions of Up, keeping Ud = 5.58 eV constant. In FM NiO, the occupied minority spin states on oxy- gen and the unoccupied minority spin states on Ni are shifted higher in energy with increasing Up, although the former at a faster rate than the latter. By itself, this means we should expect the exchange energy, and thus J1, to gradually reduce in magnitude. However, simultaneous to this feature, we notice two pivotal de- tails about the shifting occupations; (1) the t2g states are decreasing in occupation, so the Coulombic repulsion that contributes to a strong AF exchange interaction is weakening; and (2) the oxygen 2p orbitals are increasing in occupation, as demonstrated by the gradually inﬂat- ing area underneath the pDOS curve as well as the inset graphs in Figure 5. Thus, the intra-atomic Coulomb re- pulsion grows, thereby strengthening the FM preference of the superexchange mechanism.

Variations in the AFII case are present but barely discernible. the orbitals cling more closely to their respective nuclei, there is less overlap between neighboring atomic orbitals. In the NNN case, less orbital overlap translates to a de- crease in virtual hopping and therefore a weaker exchange bridge; by consequence, J2 decreases in magnitude. Yet, unlike in 180◦superexchange, the 90◦superexchange is mediated by the Coulombic exchange between orthogo- nal orbitals on the same oxygen atom (see Figure 3). As orthogonal orbitals on the same atom become more local- ized, the exchange increases in magnitude, thereby inten- sifying the ferromagnetic preference embodied by J1. So, J1 increases in magnitude and J2 decreases in magnitude, precisely as observed. In this way, it is possible that the application of the oxygen HPs on top of those applied on Ni serves to partially relocalize the atomic orbitals.

When we set Up to a large, ﬁnite number, the DOS un- dergoes signiﬁcant changes. We emphasize here that the pDOS shown in Figure 5, in addition to SM Figures 2 and 3, are truncated within the PAW augmentation spheres, with no intersti- tial contribution, based on the PAW population analysis. It therefore exhibits sharper, more atomic-like features than would be observed experimentally. An increased smearing would be needed for comparison to experiment. Furthermore, only the conduction band edge should be interpreted, and features no higher in energy thereof, due to insuﬃcient basis resolution. Our principle objective here is to understand the mechanisms of inter-atomic ex- change interactions. Despite these limitations, our AFII NiO pDOS does not deviate signiﬁcantly in its features from those of prior DFT+U calculations.139–144 The upper band is clearly of primarily Ni eg character, whereas the lower band edge is characterized by the O 2p, followed by non-negligible contributions of Ni t2g and eg character. The failure of DFT+U-like methods to replicate other features of the experimental pDOS is well-documented across the liter- ature. For example, our oxygen 2p spectrum exhibits a two-peaked structure (with edges at -5.1 eV and 0.6 eV) instead of the broad peak feature attributed to oxygen from angle-resolved photoemission spectra.145,146 This result is also at odds with the results of DFT+DMFT calculations.13,14 The width of the valence band Ni 3d spectrum is also narrower overall than might be expected, as well as appearing sharper for the aforementioned rea- sons. However, the same experiments also indicate that the NiO valence-band spectrum has two distinct peaks, one around -2 eV and the other around -5 eV, a behavior reﬂected in our own plots, where the peak-to-peak split- ting across the Fermi energy is approximately 4.6 eV, a value comparable to that derived from experiment (4.3 eV)147,148 and DMFT.13,14 We refer the reader to the SM for an analogous ﬁgure to Figure 3, where", "page": 19, "position": 0}

IV. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS In this work, we analyzed the NN and NNN Heisen- berg exchange coupling coeﬃcients of the prototypical Mott-Hubbard insulator NiO, calculating its electronic structure in its three main enforceable magnetic conﬁg- urations (FM, AFI, and AFII) in a Hubbard corrected DFT context, for comparison with experiment. First, we examined the sensitivity of the ﬁrst-principles-derived Hubbard parameters U and Jz to the PAW projectors. Here, we found that dmatpuopt=3, the population anal- ysis corresponding to the once-normalized projection of the PAW basis functions on bound AE atomic eigenfunc- tions and truncated at the PAW augmentation radius, renders a numerically well-behaved linear response pro- cedure that yields robust Hubbard parameters. These go on to provide experimentally relevant J1 and J2 exchange pairs once applied to NiO via a range of host Hubbard functionals. Our results highlight just how valuable to the simu- lation of NiO and its total energetic properties are its in situ-derived U and Jz. We report rigorously deﬁned PBE Hubbard parameters U and Jz for the Ni 3d and O 2p subspaces of NiO.

We continued to probe the minutiae of popula- tion analysis procedures to reevaluate spin-moment parametrization conventions, both inter- and intra- atomic, in the Heisenberg model. In doing so, we sys- tematically charted a particular region of DFT-accessible spin-moment parameter space to make navigation of these techniques more manageable. Our optimization of this parameter space corresponds to the particular com- bination of (i) a rudimentary-quantum, atomic-sphere- restricted intra-atomic spin moment (|SAS| = √ 2 SAS z ), and (ii) a spin-parametrization scheme that assumes |SFM| = |SAFI| = |SAFII|. We recommend this partic- ular spin treatment for magnetic properties and total energy diﬀerences pertaining to NiO, given that the re- sulting J1,J2 exchange pairs give % RMS errors (with respect to experiment) as low as 13%, a considerable improvement on state-of-the-art DFT simulations con- ducted thus far. Regardless of the Hubbard functional used, this spin treatment produced exchange coupling constants that are satisfactorily in line with experiment and highly competitive with other, more computation- ally taxing hybrid functionals, which were methodically categorized in a comprehensive literature review.

APPENDIX Appendix A: Equivalency of Unscreened Response Functions for α and β Perturbations It is important to note, for veriﬁcation purposes, that the unscreened response matrices χ0 and χM0 are equiv- alent. The proof of this is as follows. Suppose we apply, to separate spin channels, an iden- tical potential perturbation dV ↑ ext = dV ↓ ext = dVext = dα to a subspace on an atom. The unscreened change in spin-up occupancy n↑ 0 as a result of this perturbation is dn↑ 0 dVext = dn↑ 0 dV ↑ ext dV ↑ ext dVext + dn↑ 0 dV ↓ ext dV ↓ ext dVext . (A1) The second term of Eq. (A1) disappears because the occupancy of a spin channel does not change as a result of a potential perturbation on the opposing spin channel (i.e., dn↑ 0/dV ↓ ext = 0). Then dV ↑", "page": 20, "position": 0}

(A1) The second term of Eq. (A1) disappears because the occupancy of a spin channel does not change as a result of a potential perturbation on the opposing spin channel (i.e., dn↑ 0/dV ↓ ext = 0). Then dV ↑ ext/dVext = 1, leaving dn↑ 0 dVext = dn↑ 0 dV ↑ ext = dn↑ 0 dα . (A2) Similarly, via the same procedure, we ﬁnd that dn↓ 0 dVext = dn↓ 0 dα (A3) and thus the unscreened change in total occupancy of the subspace, where N0 = n↑ 0 + n↓ 0, is χ0 = dN0 dVext = d(n↑ 0 + n↓ 0) dα . (A4) Now consider that on a completely identical subspace on an identical atom, we apply a potential perturbation of dV ↑ ext = β to the spin up channel and dV ↓ ext = −β to the spin down channel. Here, we observe the unscreened change in magnetization µ0 = n↑ 0 −n↓ 0 as a result of this perturbation, which is χM0 = dµ0 dVext = d(n↑ 0 −n↓ 0) dβ = dn↑ 0 dβ −dn↓ 0 dβ . (A5) The change in spin-up occupancy with respect to β is found to be identical to Eq. (A1). But because a −β perturbation is applied to the spin down channel poten- tial, dn↓ 0 dVext = −dn↓ 0 dβ . (A6) Thus, χM0 = dµ0 dVext = dn↑ 0 dβ − −dn↓ 0 dβ ! ∴χM0 = d(n↑ 0 + n↓ 0) dβ (A7) In the event that α = β, therefore, χ0 = χM0, a con- clusion following Eqs. (A4) and (A7). [1] A. Chakraborty, M.

That which we use herein is a dielectric density mixing scheme, which is governed by input variables diemix and diemixmag (brieﬂy, deﬁned as the percentage of the total den- sity and/or magnetic density pertaining to the current SCF iteration to be mixed with those of prior itera- tions. Based on Abinit’s program architecture, the den- sity of the ﬁrst SCF iteration is mixed before the un- screened occupations/magnetizations are calculated and harvested, meaning that the printed unscreened occu- pations/magnetizations are actually fractions of those that responded to the potential perturbation. For this reason, we must divide the calculated values of χ0 and χM0 by the density mixing parameters (i.e., diemix = 0.15 for our α perturbations and diemixmag = 0.1 for our β perturbations. Furthermore, this stipulation requires we be careful in representing our linear re- sponse data and regressions. Therefore, what is plotted is the data points and polynomial ﬁt corresponding to [X(ω) + (θ −1)X(0)] /θ, where X = χ0,χM0, ω = α,", "page": 22, "position": 2}

[108] PAW datasets generated via the atompaw code103 will always feature a normalized, bound atomic eigenfunc- tion as the ﬁrst atomic wavefunction of a PAW dataset. Step 4 on Page 2 of Ref.149 states clearly that atom- paw mandates the use of “atomic eigenfunctions re- lated to valence electrons (bound states)” as the partial waves included in the PAW basis. Therefore, all PAW datasets generated by atompaw, including the JTH sets on PseudoDojo,126 have atomic eigenfunctions as the ﬁrst atomic wavefunctions of the correlated subspace. Their normalization, however, depends on the pseudo partial wave generation scheme. atompaw provides two options for this scheme: the Vanderbilt or the Bl¨ochl. We are able to reasonably infer that the JTH table of PAW datasets,126 available on the PseudoDojo website, match all criteria as a suitable dataset with which one may use dmatpuopt=1. [109] Y.-C.

MacEnulty and D. D. O’Regan School of Physics, Trinity College Dublin, The University of Dublin, Dublin 2, Ireland (Dated: December 6, 2023) I. DATA CONCERNING VARIOUS SPIN MOMENT TECHNIQUES We report here the data pertaining to the Sz and |S| calculations across all three population analysis methods for the spin moment: the atomic spheres (AS) method of Eq. (24) of the manuscript, the PAW occupations (PAW) of Eq. (25), and the full spin density (SD) as embodied by Eq. (26). Table V of the main work is a condensed reﬂection of this table. To acquire the numbers in Table V, we take the cumulative % RMS error of the exchange parameter pairs with respect to the Hutchings et al 1 experimentally obtained parameters, then average across all six Hubbard functionals (i.e., excluding the raw PBE data).
