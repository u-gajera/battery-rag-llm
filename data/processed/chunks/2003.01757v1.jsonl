Isaacs, Shane Patel, and Chris Wolverton∗ Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois 60208, USA (Dated: March 5, 2020) Quantitative predictions of the Li intercalation voltage and of the electronic properties of recharge- able battery cathode materials are a substantial challenge for ﬁrst-principles theory due to the possibility of (1) strong correlations associated with localized transition metal d electrons and (2) signiﬁcant van der Waals (vdW) interactions in layered systems, both of which are not accurately captured by standard approximations to density functional theory (DFT). Here, we perform a sys- tematic benchmark of electronic structure methods based on the widely-used generalized gradient approximation of Perdew, Burke, and Ernzerhof (PBE) and the new strongly constrained and appro- priately normed (SCAN) meta-generalized gradient approximation for battery cathode materials. Studying layered LixTiS2, LixNiO2, and LixCoO2, olivine LixFePO4, and spinel LixMn2O4, we compute the voltage, crystal structure, and electronic structure with and without extensions to incorporate on-site Hubbard interactions and vdW interactions. Within pure DFT (i.e., without corrections for on-site Hubbard interactions), SCAN is a signiﬁcant improvement over PBE for de- scribing cathode materials, decreasing the mean absolute voltage error by more than 50%. Although explicit vdW interactions are not critical and in cases even detrimental when applied in conjunction with SCAN, Hubbard U corrections are still in general necessary to achieve reasonable agreement with experiment. We show that no single method considered here can accurately describe the voltage and overall structural, electronic, and magnetic properties (i.e., errors no more than 5% for voltage, volume, band gap, and magnetic moments) of battery cathode materials, motivating a strong need for improved electronic structure approaches for such systems.

I. INTRODUCTION Li-ion rechargeable battery cathodes, which are typ- ically composed of transition metal oxides, represent a challenging testbed for ﬁrst-principles theory. Prediction of the Li intercalation voltage is of particular importance given it is a fundamental battery property that helps determine the battery power and closely relates to the (de)lithiation mechanism. The average Li intercalation voltage V relates to the diﬀerence in Li chemical potential between the cathode and anode. For a battery cathode whose Li content changes changes from x1 to x2 > x1, V relative to Li metal is given by eV = ELi + E(x1)−E(x2) (x2−x1) , where e is the elementary charge, ELi is the energy of Li metal, and E(x) is the energy of the cathode material with Li concentration x [1, 2]. For example, for LixCoO2, over the full range of Li (x1 = 0 for CoO2, x2 = 1 for LiCoO2), V is given by eV = ELi + E(0) −E(1). In principle, Gibbs free energies should be used in the previ- ous expressions; we ignore pressure-volume and entropic contributions typically small compared to the magnitude of V [3]. Since V is a function of the total energies of phases whose electron distributions diﬀer starkly (lead- ing to fewer opportunities for error cancellation), it is a useful observable to serve as a stringent benchmark of ab initio thermodynamics approaches. Density functional theory (DFT) [4, 5], within the gen- eralized gradient approximation (GGA) [6] in particular, ∗c-wolverton@northwestern.edu has become the de facto standard for electronic structure calculations of solids. Despite its many successes, DFT struggles to capture the composition-dependent energet- ics necessary to describe the intercalation voltage and compositional phase stability of battery cathode materi- als. For example, in the case of olivine LixFePO4 [7, 8], DFT in the GGA substantially underestimates the ex- perimental V (by ∼20%) and fails to qualitatively cap- ture the experimentally-observed phase separation for intermediate Li concentrations [9, 10].

In order to ad- dress this challenge, a wide variety of electronic struc- ture approaches, including DFT with diﬀerent exchange- correlation functionals [1, 2, 11–13], hybrid functionals [14, 15], van der Waals (vdW) functionals [16], DFT plus on-site Hubbard U (DFT+U) [10, 17–21], DFT+U+V (where V is an inter-site interaction) [22], DFT plus dy- namical mean-ﬁeld theory [23], and diﬀusion quantum Monte Carlo [24] have been applied to battery cathode voltages. It remains an open question what interactions and level of theory beyond DFT in the GGA are needed to adequately describe such materials. Among these works, we mention two recent develop- ments pertaining to cathode voltage prediction. The ﬁrst is the work of Aykol et al., who found that vdW interactions, employed in conjunction with DFT+U and the widely-used GGA of Perdew, Burke, and Ernzerhof (PBE), are necessary to accurately describe the voltage for layered LixCoO2 [16]. Second, also studying layered cathode materials, Chakraborty et al. found that the new strongly constrained and appropriately normed (SCAN) DFT functional considerably improves the voltage pre- diction even without Hubbard U or explicit vdW correc- arXiv:2003.01757v1 [cond-mat.mtrl-sci] 3 Mar 2020", "page": 0, "position": 2}

In this work, we perform a systematic study of the average Li intercalation voltage of ﬁve classic cathode materials: layered LixTiS2, olivine LixFePO4, layered LixNiO2, spinel LixMn2O4, and layered LixCoO2. For the ﬁve cathode materials, we investigate the impact on V of (1) the new SCAN exchange-correlation func- tional, (2) the use of density functionals explicitly con- sidering vdW interactions, and (3) on-site Hubbard U within DFT+U. In all cases, the calculations are crit- ically compared to experiments to assess accuracy. We also consider other quantities (volumes, electronic band gaps, and magnetic moments) in order to provide a more complete picture of the accuracy of the methods. Within pure DFT [25], we ﬁnd that SCAN is a signif- icant improvement for describing battery cathode mate- rials, decreasing the mean-absolute-error for V by more than 50%, as compared to PBE [6], from 0.67 V to 0.30 V. In some cases (e.g., LixFePO4 and LixMn2O4) Hub- bard U corrections are still necessary to achieve reason- able agreement (i.e., within 5%) with experiment. There- fore, given the improvement of SCAN over PBE, quan- titative voltage predictions within pure DFT are closer but still currently out of reach. When applied in com- bination with SCAN, Hubbard U within DFT+U can lead to worsened predictions in some cases (i.e., LixTiS2 and LixCoO2). In other words, within DFT+U, Hub- bard U added to SCAN does not universally help or hurt the predictions. In the one case in which SCAN itself provides a suﬃcient prediction of V (i.e., LixNiO2), we ﬁnd it is still possible to achieve a better overall elec- tronic structure description using DFT+U calculations based on PBE rather than SCAN. Therefore, calculations based on SCAN should not necessarily be considered uni- versally better than those based on PBE when consider- ing both the energetics and overall electronic structure.

In the majority of the cases, when Hub- bard U is also considered with PBE, the experimental V can be achieved with or without vdW interactions (for diﬀerent values of U). Therefore, it is not clear that missing vdW interactions are a signiﬁcant source of PBE’s well-known voltage underprediction in general. We ﬁnd that such vdW interactions are signiﬁcantly less important in terms of V when applied in conjunction with SCAN, which already contains some intermediate- range vdW interactions. Overall, despite the signiﬁcantly improved V predictions of SCAN as compared to PBE within pure DFT, we illustrate that no single method considered here can generally describe the voltage and overall electronic structure of battery cathode materials, motivating a strong need for improved electronic struc- ture approaches for such systems. II. SUMMARY OF ELECTRONIC STRUCTURE APPROACHES TESTED A. Exchange-correlation functional The key ingredient to DFT is the exchange-correlation functional Exc, which encapsulates all the interaction ef- fects beyond the single-particle kinetic energy and mean- ﬁeld (Hartree) Coulomb energy [26]. Exc in the local density approximation (LDA) depends solely on the elec- tron density ρ and is parametrized to exactly describe the homogeneous electron gas (jellium) [27]. In GGA, Exc depends on ∇ρ in addition to ρ, which allows for the satisfaction of additional constraints such as the cor- rect behavior in the slowly- and rapidly-varying density limits [6]. A higher level of theory is the meta-GGA, in which Exc exhibits an additional dependence on the orbital kinetic energy density τ = X i 1 2|∇ψi|2, (1) where ψi is the ith occupied Kohn-Sham wavefunction, corresponding to functional that is implicitly nonlocal in ρ. The strongly constrained and appropriately normed (SCAN) functional [28] is a new meta-GGA, which satis- ﬁes 17 known constraints of the exact Exc and has", "page": 1, "position": 1}

The strongly constrained and appropriately normed (SCAN) functional [28] is a new meta-GGA, which satis- ﬁes 17 known constraints of the exact Exc and has shown signiﬁcant promise in the description of solids [28–32]. Just as PBE is built on top of LDA (reproducing the LDA result for jellium), SCAN is built on top of PBE and ex- hibits the same behavior as PBE for slowly-varying densi- ties in the metallic bonding regime of τ. We note that the SCAN functional implicitly contains some “intermediate- range” vdW interactions [28], and it also can be incor- porated in methods containing explicit vdW interactions [33], as discussed below. Very relevant to the prediction of battery cathode volt- ages is that SCAN has been shown to yield signiﬁcant improvement to formation energy predictions as com- pared to PBE for strongly-bound compounds like ox- ides [34, 35]. Indeed, for a few layered cathode materi- als, very recent work has suggested that SCAN achieves more accurate V prediction compared to PBE [13, 23]. In particular, based on calculations of layered LixNiO2, LixCoO2, and LixMnO2 with PBE, PBE+U, and SCAN, Chakraborty et al. found that SCAN performs better than PBE and PBE+U for the V proﬁles. Based on the V behavior, as well as predicted lattice parameters, den- sities of states, and ρ (as compared to that from the PBE0 hybrid functional), they concluded that SCAN without Hubbard U exhibits good overall performance for layered cathode materials. Whether such trends hold more gen- erally (e.g., for non-layered cathodes) is an open question addressed by this work.", "page": 1, "position": 2}

Explicit van der Waals interactions The lack of nonlocal correlation eﬀects needed to cap- ture vdW interactions is a well-documented limitation of standard DFT [36–41]. In order to address this limita- tion, ﬁrst-principles vdW density functionals have been developed. In such functionals, a nonlocal correlation energy term (explicitly nonlocal in ρ) of the form Enl c = 1 2 Z Z ρ(r)φ(r, r′)ρ(r′)d3rd3r′ (2) is incorporated in Exc [42, 43]. Here, φ(r, r′) is the ker- nel, which is typically based on approximations to the frequency-dependent polarizability. For example, Dion et al. devised a kernel based on a plasmon pole approx- imation to the dielectric function ϵ and a second-order expansion of the polarization S = 1 −ϵ−1 [39, 42], such that the kernel is a function of ρ and ∇ρ at spatial coor- dinates r and r′ as well as |r −r′|. Aykol et al. recently tested a variety of methodologies incorporating vdW interactions (including ﬁrst-principles and semiempirical approaches) on LixCoO2 [16]. The ﬁrst-principles opt-type vdW density functionals [44, 45], such as optPBE-vdW, were found to yield the most ac- curate V predictions and correspond to a signiﬁcant im- provement over standard density functionals lacking vdW interactions. This opens up the question of how impor- tant vdW interactions are to describe battery cathode materials in general (i.e., beyond LixCoO2), which we address in this work. We focus on optPBE-vdW in this work [44, 45]. optPBE-vdW combines a linear combination of the ex- change forms of PBE and the related RPBE [46], LDA local correlation, and the kernel of Ref. 42. In optPBE- vdW, the fraction of PBE-like [6] and RPBE-like [46] exchange and the two parameters employed in both such forms have been optimized (hence the “opt”) to mini- mize interaction energy errors for the Set 22 (S22) quan- tum chemistry benchmark [47]. When we refer to adding vdW interactions to PBE in this work, we are refer- ring to the optPBE-vdW method. Although this is not strictly accurate as the diﬀerence between PBE and optPBE-vdW is not additive, we do so for convenience and since optPBE-vdW", "page": 2, "position": 0}

Although this is not strictly accurate as the diﬀerence between PBE and optPBE-vdW is not additive, we do so for convenience and since optPBE-vdW is closely connected to PBE. We also consider the SCAN plus revised Vydrov-Van Voorhis 2010 (SCAN+rVV10) vdW functional [33, 48, 49], which corresponds to a diﬀerent choice of kernel with one of its two parameters ﬁt to best reproduce the Ar dimer binding curve from coupled cluster singles, doubles, and perturbative triples [CCSD(T)] quantum chemistry cal- culations. SCAN+rVV10 is explored in this work for purely practical reasons as it is currently the only vdW functional implemented in conjunction with the SCAN functional in the Vienna ab initio simulation package (vasp). In this work, we also refer to SCAN+rVV10 as SCAN+vdW for convenience. C. On-site Hubbard U corrections In an attempt to correct for the deﬁciencies of DFT (using common approximations like the GGA), the DFT+U approach [50] has become a widely used method to describe cathode materials. In this methodology, DFT is augmented with an on-site Hubbard interaction U (solved within static mean-ﬁeld theory) related to strong electronic correlations in a chosen subspace of localized orbitals (deﬁned via transition metal d orbital projectors in this work). In this methodology, the energy depends on the on-site density matrix for the transition metal d orbitals in addition to ρ. In particular, using the sim- pliﬁed rotationally-invariant formalism of Dudarev et al. [51] and the fully localized limit (FLL) double counting [52], the DFT+U energy can be written as EDF T +U = EDF T [ρs] + 1 2U X τ,m,s nτs m (1 −nτs m ), (3) where ρs is the spin-density, EDF T [ρs] is the (spin- dependent) DFT energy and nτs m is the mth eigenvalue of the density matrix corresponding to transition metal site τ and spin projection s.", "page": 2, "position": 1}

Written this way, it is visi- ble that the eﬀect of DFT+U is to penalize non-integer occupancy of the localized orbitals. DFT+U has been shown to help alleviate the voltage underestimation of DFT in the GGA [10], and it has become a standard tool to describe cathode materials. However, recent evidence suggests it may lead to con- siderable problems. In particular, for LixCoO2, DFT+U yields spurious gaps and charge ordering, as well as over- estimated Li order-disorder temperatures [21]. The abil- ity of DFT+U to accurately describe cathode materials in general is an open question we aim to address in this work. We note that DFT+U is a static approximation to the more accurate DFT plus dynamical mean-ﬁeld the- ory (DFT+DMFT), in which the local correlation prob- lem is solved exactly rather than via the Hartree-Fock approximation of DFT+U. Recent DFT+DMFT calcu- lations found a signiﬁcantly diﬀerent V prediction for LixCoO2 as compared to DFT+U, suggesting dynami- cal correlations neglected by DFT+U but captured by DFT+DMFT may also be important in battery cath- ode materials [23]. However, due to the large compu- tational cost to solve the quantum impurity problem in DFT+DMFT, we do not explore the role of dynamical correlations in this work. III. COMPUTATIONAL DETAILS Spin-dependent density functional theory calculations using the projector augmented wave (PAW) method [53, 54] and a 520 eV plane wave kinetic energy cutoﬀ are performed using vasp [55–58].

Crystal structures and nominal electronic conﬁgurations We begin by brieﬂy discussing the structures and electronic conﬁguration of the cathode materials con- sidered. The crystal structures and nominal transition metal (TM) d electron conﬁgurations for the ﬁve cathode materials are illustrated in Fig. 1. All the compounds considered have octahedral coordination of TM by oxy- gen. Although the octahedra are often distorted, we still refer to the lowest energy three d levels as t2g and the highest energy two d levels as eg for simplicity, where t2g and eg are the irreducible representations of d orbitals in perfect octahedral symmetry. LixTiS2, LixNiO2, and LixCoO2 are layered materi- als with alternating layers of Li and edge-sharing TM– oxygen octahedra. TiS2 (t0 2ge0 g), LiTiS2 (t1 2ge0 g), and CoO2 (t5 2ge0 g) are in the hexagonal P¯3m1 structure (O1 structure) [63–65]. NiO2 and LiCoO2 (both t6 2ge0 g) are considered in the rhombohedral R¯3m structure (O3 structure) [66–69]. We model LiNiO2 (t6 2ge1 g) with the monoclinic Pm structure [70], which captures the Jahn- Teller distortion. For the LixCoO2 case, in addition to computing V for the full 0 < x < 1 range, we also com- pute V for x < 1 2 and x > 1 2. To do so, we consider Li1/2CoO2 in the known monoclinic P2/m structure, which corresponds to an in-plane Li/vacancy ordering in a unit cell twice as large as the primitive rhombohedral", "page": 3, "position": 0}

For the LixCoO2 case, in addition to computing V for the full 0 < x < 1 range, we also com- pute V for x < 1 2 and x > 1 2. To do so, we consider Li1/2CoO2 in the known monoclinic P2/m structure, which corresponds to an in-plane Li/vacancy ordering in a unit cell twice as large as the primitive rhombohedral cell [71]. In contrast to the other materials, LixFePO4 and LixMn2O4 do not exhibit layered crystal structures. Olivine FePO4 (t3 2ge2 g) and LiFePO4 (t4 2ge2 g) crystallize in an orthorhombic Pnma structure consisting of (1) one-dimensional channels of Li and (2) layers of cor- ner sharing Fe–oxygen octahedra connected via phos- phate groups [72, 73]. To model LixMn2O4, we consider Mn2O4 (t3 2ge0 g) in the ideal spinel-like Fd¯3m structure (λ- MnO2), which consists of a diamond sublattice of Li and a three-dimensional network of edge-sharing Mn–oxygen octahedra [74, 75]. In order to capture possible Jahn- Teller eﬀects, we model LiMn2O4 (nominally in the t3.5 2g e0 g conﬁguration) with the symmetry-broken ferromagnetic monoclinic C2/c structure from Ref. 76. Ferromagnetic ordering is considered for all magnetic compounds ex- cept LixFePO4, which exhibits antiferromagnetic order- ing [73]. B. Pure DFT Figure 2 shows the average intercalation voltages over the full Li concentration range (0 < x < 1) within pure DFT (U = 0). As has been shown previously [10], PBE systematically and substantially underpredicts V , yield- ing a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.67 V. SCAN repre- sents a signiﬁcant improvement over PBE in terms of the predicted V , reducing the MAE by over 50% to 0.30 V. However, some errors are still unacceptably large (e.g., 15% error for LixMn2O4). In this sense, quantitative V predictions within DFT are closer to being achieved but are still currently out of reach. For most of the cath- ode materials, SCAN still underpredicts the experimental values despite the appreciable increase in V with respect to PBE values.

For most of the cath- ode materials, SCAN still underpredicts the experimental values despite the appreciable increase in V with respect to PBE values. There are two exceptions to this trend: (1) LixNiO2, for which the SCAN prediction (3.8 V) is nearly identical to the experimental value (3.9 V) and (2) LixCoO2, for which the SCAN prediction (4.5 V) is appreciably larger than experiment (4.2 V). The increase in V of SCAN with respect to PBE is highly system de- pendent: while this increase is 1.0 V for LixCoO2, it is a mere 0.2 V for LixMn2O4. Explicit vdW interactions also generally yield an in- crease in predicted V , though of a smaller magnitude. For example, adding vdW interactions to PBE (i.e., optPBE-vdW) reduces the MAE from 0.67 V to 0.42 V. Here, the voltage increases are less system-dependent: similar increases of 0.1–0.3 V (4–10%) for optPBE-vdW with respect to PBE are found for all ﬁve cathode materi- als. The V enhancement is not generally smaller for non- layered materials: V increases by 10% for LixFePO4, for example. In contrast, adding vdW interactions to SCAN (i.e., SCAN+vdW) does not appreciably increase pre- dicted V and an MAE of 0.27 V (negligibly smaller than the 0.30 V value for SCAN) is obtained. We believe this behavior stems from the construction of SCAN+vdW since a parameter in the rVV10 form is ﬁt speciﬁcally for SCAN, which already intrinsically contains some intermediate-range vdW interactions. Based on the pre- dicted V behavior, we ﬁnd that explicit vdW methods are not critical when applied in conjunction with SCAN for battery cathode materials. This suggests that the vdW interactions intrinsic to SCAN are likely suﬃcient to de- scribe vdW interactions in this class of materials.

In Fig. 4, one can observe the same main trends discussed above for the LixCoO2 V over the full range of x: (1) SCAN signif- icantly increases the voltage, exceeding experiment and (2) incorporating explicit vdW interactions moderately enhances the voltages when added to PBE, but negligi- bly when added to SCAN. We focus on the “voltage gap” at x = 1/2, i.e., the diﬀerence between the voltage av- erage of 1/2 < x < 1 and that of 0 < x < 1/2. Such a voltage gap ∆V is a measure of the formation energy of a stable (on the convex hull) phase of intermediate Li concentration with respect to the x = 0 and x = 1 endmembers, which can be written as −x(1 −x)e∆V [19]. Therefore, the x = 1/2 voltage gap of LixCoO2 is a convenient benchmark for compositional phase sta- bility. The voltage gap predicted by PBE (−0.9 V) is signiﬁcantly larger in magnitude than the experimental value (−0.4 V).

C. DFT+U Figure 5 shows the DFT+U average intercalation volt- ages over the full Li concentration range. We ﬁrst com- ment on the general impact of U on the intercalation volt- ages. Although an increase in V has typically been found with increasing U for battery cathode materials (shown here as well as in previous works [9, 10, 16, 19, 21, 22]), we also ﬁnd the opposite behavior in the small-U limit in some of the cases (e.g., LixTiS2). An increase in V with U necessarily stems from the larger energy penalty on the x = 0 endmember than the x = 1 endmember, since eV is proportional to E(0) −E(1). Similarly, a decrease in V with U corresponds to a greater energetic penalty on x = 1 than x = 0. Nominal electron counting corresponding to com- pletely ﬁlled or completely empty states (as suggested by most of the level diagrams in Fig. 1) is insuﬃcient by itself to explain these trends, as the energy penalty from DFT+U (using the FLL double counting) exactly vanishes in such a fully localized limit, as can be seen in Eq. 3. However, knowledge of the electron counting in conjunction with the overall electronic structure can be used to explain the observed trends. For example, for LixCoO2, U penalizes metallic x = 0 more than the band insulator x = 1, which has closer-to-integer d or- bital occupations [21] due to electron counting (as well as to the increased ionicity stemming from Li). There- fore, V increases", "page": 5, "position": 1}

There- fore, V increases with U. The reverse situation occurs for LixTiS2: here, x = 0 is the band insulator and x = 1 has a partially-ﬁlled t2g shell, corresponding to a metal. This explains the decrease in V in the small-U limit (the increase at larger U is discussed later). Anal- ogously, a negative ∂V/∂U in the small-U limit is also found for LixMn2O4 using PBE and optPBE-vdW since within these levels of theory Mn2O4 is insulating and LiMn2O4 is metallic for small U. The voltage increases with U for LixFePO4 and LixNiO2, though the origin of the increases is diﬀerent than the LixCoO2 case. For LixFePO4, whose endmembers are both magnetic insula- tors, it is the enhanced covalency of the x = 0 endmem- ber [21] that gives it a larger energy penalty. And for LixNiO2, despite the nominally partially-ﬁlled eg shell for x = 1, the increased ordering from the Jahn-Teller distortion allows the x = 1 endmember to be less aﬀected by U than the x = 0 endmember. Due to the diversity of behavior observed, we now dis- cuss the speciﬁc results (including the behavior with dif- ferent levels of theory in comparison with experiment) for each material separately. Afterwards, we present a general synthesis of the results. We begin with LixTiS2. As discussed above, small values of U for LixTiS2 serve to decrease the predicted V , which already underestimates the experimental value within pure DFT. We also note that, for the majority of the pure DFT levels of theory considered here, U also hurts the volume prediction (shown in Fig. 6) for LixTiS2. Therefore, in the case of LixTiS2, adding Hub-", "page": 5, "position": 2}

Consistent with this ﬁnding, we note that the past work of Chevrier et al. avoided the use of Hubbard U for Ti-based compounds [14]. Here, we comment on the discontinuous behavior at larger U. A metal-insulator transition for LiTiS2 at larger U decreases its energy penalty relative to TiS2, leading to a change in sign in ∂V/∂U. The insulating behavior is spurious as LiTiS2 is actually metallic in ex- periment [81]. This raises the question of whether this predicted insulating state for LiTiS2 for larger U corre- sponds to (1) an intrinsic failure of DFT+U or simply (2) the use of an unphysically-large U parameter. Us- ing a self-consistent linear response approach and PBE, Shishkin and Sato computed U of 5.5 eV for LiTiS2 (us- ing same the PAW potential for Ti we employ, which treats the 4s semicore states as valence states) [20].

In conjunction with the pure DFT results discussed above, we ﬁnd that the application of SCAN (as opposed to PBE) and vdW interactions signiﬁcantly improves the voltage prediction for LixTiS2, while U hurts the descrip- tion. We note that SCAN+vdW, which exhibits the best agreement with the experimental V (error of only 0.1 V), has worse volume predictions than those of SCAN for LixTiS2 (for LiTiS2 in particular), as shown in Fig. 3. For LixFePO4, the pure DFT approaches are insuﬃ- cient to quantitatively describe the voltage. However, the predicted voltage increases roughly linearly with U in all cases, enabling agreement with experiment using DFT+U. For PBE, the optimal U value to achieve agree- ment with experiment is 4.2 V, in agreement with previ- ous work [9, 10, 21]. This value also agrees well with the overall magnitude of the ﬁrst-principles U values for the x = 0 (4.9 V) and x = 1 (3.7 V) endmembers computed from ﬁrst principles (with PBE) via the linear response approach [10]. Since adding vdW interactions to PBE (i.e., optPBE-vdW) provides a roughly rigid increase in the predicted V , of around 0.3 V, the optimal U value to achieve agreement with the experimental V for optPBE- vdW is 2.0 eV, substantially lower than the PBE case. SCAN+U and SCAN+vdW+U yield essentially identi- cal V predictions, consistent with the intrinsic vdW in- teractions in SCAN. For such methods, the predicted V matches experiment for U = 3.0 eV, also signiﬁcantly lower than the PBE case. Although not computed here, it would be interest- ing to assess whether the ﬁrst-principles U values based on optPBE-vdW and/or SCAN(+vdW) would also be appreciably lower than those of PBE, leading to the same consistency observed for PBE in terms of the ﬁrst- principles U and U ﬁt to experimental V .

We note that the optimal U = 3.0 eV for SCAN(+vdW), in terms of V , agrees well with U values found to reproduce the FeO/Fe2O3 (2.9 eV) and FeO/Fe3O4 (3.3 eV) experimen- tal oxidation reaction energies in a recent SCAN+U work by Sai Gautam and Carter [82]. The volume behavior for LixFePO4 is shown in Fig. 6. SCAN+U yields the best volume prediction for LixFePO4 among all the methods considered in this work, though some underestimation of the LiFePO4 volume persists. The band gap and local Fe magnetic moment behaviors for LixFePO4 are shown in the Supplemental Material [83]. The application of U to SCAN also signiﬁ- cantly improves the predicted LiFePO4 band gap, though the FePO4 gap (already in good agreement with experi- ment for U = 0) becomes overestimated. A similar eﬀect is found in terms of the local Fe magnetic moment, with overestimation (underestimation) for FePO4 (LiFePO4). Ultimately, while U can be chosen to yield agreement with the experimental V using DFT+U based on any of the pure DFT methodologies considered here, we ﬁnd that SCAN+U using U of ∼3 eV provides the best (al- though still imperfect) overall description of LixFePO4 when also taking into account the volume, band gap, and local magnetic moments. For LixNiO2, the pure DFT prediction using PBE sig- niﬁcantly underestimates experiment, but agreement can be reached for U of ∼6 eV, which is close in value to the PBE ﬁrst-principles computed endmember U val- ues [10]. The behavior is similar for optPBE-vdW+U, whose V predictions are ∼0.2 eV larger than those of PBE+U. The behavior for SCAN is quite distinct.

Here, the SCAN-predicted V already exhibits excellent agree- ment (within ∼0.1 V) with experiment even without Hubbard U. Therefore, the application of U in this case pushes V to far too large values. This is also true for SCAN+vdW+U, which exhibits a small, roughly con- stant ∼0.1 V increase in V with respect to SCAN+U. Although one can achieve a satisfactory quantitative V prediction using PBE/optPBE-vdW with U (∼6 eV) or SCAN(+vdW) without U, the volume prediction (shown in Fig. 6) suggests such approaches are not equivalent in their overall description. SCAN and SCAN+vdW provide worsened volume predictions as compared to PBE+U. Although optPBE-vdW+U yields a similar LiNiO2 volume as PBE+U, its volume prediction for NiO2 is signiﬁcantly worse than PBE+U. We note addi- tionally that PBE+U yields an accurate band gap pre- diction for LiNiO2, as shown in the Supplemental Ma- terial. Overall, despite the excellent V prediction using SCAN(+vdW), we ﬁnd PBE+U provides the overall best description of LixNiO2. The LixMn2O4 case is similar to that of LixFePO4 in that a quantitatively accurate V prediction can be achieved using calculations based on any of the pure DFT methodologies considered here, but only using Hubbard U. U values of 5.7 eV (reasonably close in value to the ﬁrst-principles computed endmember U values [10]) and 4.4 eV are needed to achieve agreement with the experi- mental V for PBE and optPBE-vdW, respectively. The SCAN+U and SCAN+vdW+U voltages agree with ex- periment for the signiﬁcantly smaller value of U = 2.6 eV. This value is in good agreement with the U val- ues found to reproduce the MnO/Mn2O3 (2.9 eV) and Mn2O3/MnO2 (2.5 eV) experimental oxidation reaction energies in the work of Sai Gautam and Carter [82].

The LixCoO2 voltage is signiﬁcantly underestimated within pure DFT using PBE (by 0.8 V). The signiﬁcant increase in the predicted V when adding U to PBE, which is dampened via a spurious metal-insulator transition for CoO2, is still insuﬃcient to achieve agreement with the experimental V [16, 19, 21]. As was previously shown [16], adding vdW interactions via optPBE-vdW+U fur- ther enhances V with respect to PBE+U and enables agreement with experiment. Therefore, it was suggested [16] that such nonlocal correlation eﬀects were associated with the V underprediction within PBE+U for LixCoO2 (and possibly other transition metal oxides). We repro- duce the previous result here and ﬁnd that the optPBE- vdW+U voltage agrees with experiment for U = 4.4 eV. SCAN provides a drastically diﬀerent V prediction for LixCoO2 [13, 23], moderately overestimating (by 0.3 V) the experimental voltage. Since U serves to increase V in this case, the SCAN+U voltage predictions for LixCoO2 become even further from experiment. As observed in many of the cases discussed above, adding vdW inter- actions to SCAN+U (SCAN+vdW+U) has a relatively modest impact as compared to the diﬀerence between optPBE-vdW+U and PBE+U.

We note that, de- spite U further overestimating the voltage magnitudes when applied to SCAN(+vdW), it does lead to an im- proved voltage gap at x = 1/2. Although optPBE-vdW+U achieves agreement with the experimental voltage (overall the full and half x ranges), it may not provide an accurate overall descrip- tion of LixCoO2. As shown in the Supplemental Material, although it exhibits an accurate prediction of the LiCoO2 band gap, optPBE-vdW+U exhibits the same spurious orderings as PBE+U: CoO2 gap opening and large mag- netic moment of PBE+U, as well as Li1/2CoO2 charge ordering and gap opening. We discuss two possible alternatives to optPBE- vdW+U for best describing LixCoO2. The ﬁrst alterna- tive is to use pure SCAN. Despite modest voltage overes- timation (e.g., 0.3 V for 0 < x < 1), SCAN does not ex- hibit any of the spurious gap opening or charge ordering discussed above. It also exhibits a very accurate LiCoO2 band gap, Li1/2CoO2 magnetic moment, and reasonably accurate volume predictions, as shown in Fig. 3 and the Supplemental Material. In addition, although the over- all voltage magnitudes are moderately overestimated, the x = 1/2 voltage gap (related to the x = 1/2 formation en- ergy) agrees decently well with experiment, as discussed in the previous section. The second alternative is to use DFT+DMFT (to which DFT+U is a static approx- imation ignoring dynamical correlations) in conjunction with SCAN, as very recent work using non-charge-self- consistent DFT+DMFT [23] found that dynamical cor- relations (1) are large and x-dependent in", "page": 8, "position": 1}

Further work to assess which of these alternatives (or another) is optimal to accurately describe LixCoO2 will be important future work. Finally, we summarize our overall ﬁndings regarding describing battery cathode materials within DFT+U. As discussed in the previous section, within pure DFT, it is clear that (1) SCAN is superior to PBE and (2) adding additional vdW interactions beyond those intrinsic to SCAN is not essential and is in some cases detrimental. With DFT+U, the results are less clear cut. In the case of LixTiS2, adding Hubbard U generally yields no improvement over the corresponding pure DFT V results (which are only modestly underestimated with SCAN and SCAN+vdW), if one takes into account the spurious LiTiS2 metal-insulator transition predicted by DFT+U occurring for suﬃciently-large U. In contrast, Hubbard U is essential to achieve a voltage prediction in agreement with experiment for LixFePO4 and LiMn2O4. Therefore, the new SCAN functional does not elimi- nate the need for Hubbard U corrections. In fact, we ﬁnd SCAN+U provides the best description of these two cathode materials. Therefore, it is not true that SCAN eliminates the need for U for battery cathode materi- als in general, in contrast to this conclusion reached by Chakraborty et al. in their study of layered systems [13].

Therefore, we ﬁnd that calculations based on SCAN should not be univer- sally considered superior to those based on PBE. Finally, in the case of LixCoO2, none of the methods considered here gives a suﬃcient description of both the voltage and electronic structure, though SCAN arguably fares the best. Taking all these results into account, despite the im- proved performance obtained via pure DFT and DFT+U calculations based on SCAN for certain cases, we ﬁnd that no single method can suﬃciently accurately describe the voltage and overall structural, electronic, and mag- netic properties (i.e., yielding errors no more than 5% for voltage, volume, band gap, and magnetic moments) of the battery cathode materials considered here. Our re- sults strongly motivate the need for improved electronic structure approaches for such systems. V. CONCLUSIONS Despite the great need for an accurate and computa- tionally inexpensive approach to characterize and design battery cathode materials, such a method still remains out of reach at present. Within pure DFT, SCAN is a signiﬁcant improvement over PBE for describing cathode materials, though appreciable errors remain. Methods in- corporating explicit vdW interactions are not critical and in cases even detrimental when applied in conjunction with SCAN, which already intrinsically contains some intermediate-range vdW interactions. Hubbard U corrections considered within DFT+U are essential to achieve an accurate voltage prediction in some cases (e.g., LixFePO4 and LixMn2O4) and detri- mental in others (e.g., LixTiS2). Although we ﬁnd SCAN+U provides the best description for LixFePO4 and LixMn2O4, we ﬁnd PBE+U gives the best descrip- tion for LixNiO2, suggesting DFT+U calculations based on SCAN should not be considered universally superior to those based on PBE.
