Employing two-dimensional (2D) materials as anodes for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) is believed to be an effective approach to meet the growing demands of high-capacity next- generation LIBs. In this work, the first-principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations are employed to evaluate the potential application of two-dimensional phosphorus carbide (2D 𝑃𝐶𝑥, x=2, 5, and 6) monolayers as anode materials for lithium- ion batteries. The 2D 𝑃𝐶𝑥 systems are predicted to show outstanding structural stability and electronic properties. From the nudge elastic band calculations, the Li atoms show extreme high diffusivities on the PCx monolayer with low energy barriers of 0.18 eV for 𝑃𝐶2, 0.47 eV for 𝑃𝐶5, and 0.44 eV for 𝑃𝐶6. We further demonstrate that the theoretical specific capacity of monolayer 𝑃𝐶5 and 𝑃𝐶6 can reach up to 1251.7 and 1235.9 mAh g- 1, respectively, several times that of graphite anode used in commercial LIBs. These results suggest that both 𝑃𝐶5 and 𝑃𝐶6 monolayer are promising anode materials for LIBs.

Introduction In recent years, battery systems have made a big contribution to the rapid development of the electronics market.1, 2 Among all types of batteries, lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), as one of the greatest successes of clean energy storage technologies, have attracted widespread attention.3-6 Conventional anode materials in LIBs have a bulk structure with low capacity and high diffusion barrier which hinder their further applications.7 Since the successful isolation of graphene from graphite,8-10 two-dimensional (2D) materials, such as hexagonal boron nitride,11, 12 phosphorene,13-15 transition metal dichalcogenides,16 and MXenes17-19 have been widely studied and identified as potential anode materials with enhanced electronic properties for LIBs. Despite these efforts, designing 2D anodes with higher capacity and lower diffusion barrier which can be commercialized is still a challenging job for researchers. It is well-known that graphene and phosphorene are two important 2D materials that have potential applications in LIBs. Graphene shows excellent conductivity and stability, but six carbon atoms can only adsorb one Li ion to form a 𝐿𝑖𝐶6 intercalation.20 As a comparison, one Li atom can be intercalated with two phosphorus atoms in phosphorene, while the disadvantage of phosphorene is the limited stability in air or humid environment.21, 22 Since both elemental carbon and phosphorus are reported to form stable 2D monolayers and have similar structures including three-fold coordinated atoms and a hexagonal network,23-25 it is reasonable to believe that compound phosphorus carbides can", "page": 2, "position": 0}

Until now, several phosphorus carbide monolayers have been theoretically predicted to be stable, among which 2D PC has been fabricated successfully through doping C atoms into phosphorus ones.25-31. Tan et al. have synthesized metallic black phosphorus carbide (β-PC) which has been verified to be stable at the DFT level,26 and Zhang et al. has proposed to use the γ-PC in the LIBs.28 However, the studies of 2D phosphorus carbide as a promising anode material for LIBs are still scarce due to limited 2D candidates and possible structural instability. Recently, Yu et al. have performed extensive structural search for 𝑃𝐶𝑥 (x=2, 3, 5, and 6) monolayers, and they found that 𝑃𝐶2 (metal), 𝑃𝐶3 (semiconductor with a band gap of 2.15 eV), 𝑃𝐶5 (metal) and 𝑃𝐶6 (semiconductor with a band gap of 0.84 eV) are thermodynamically stable.30 The predicted PCx structures except for wide-band-gap semiconductor PC3, may have potential applications in anodes for LIBs, but theoretical or experimental evidence is lacking. Inspired by the great potential of PC in LIBs discussed above, in this work, we systematically investigate the stability, electronic and Li storage properties of 𝑃𝐶2, 𝑃𝐶5 and 𝑃𝐶6 monolayers by means of density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Our calculations reveal that 𝑃𝐶𝑥 (x=2, 5, and 6) systems show not only excellent thermal and dynamic stability but also high electron and ionic conductivities.

Computational methods Our calculations were performed in the framework of DFT calculations by the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP).32 The generalized gradient approximation (GGA) with the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) flavor33 was chosen as the exchange-correlation functional. Van der Waals interaction was considered by using the semiempirical DFT- D234 approach. For the calculation of band structures and density of states (DOS), a more accurate HSE06 hybrid functional35 was applied. The plane-wave cut-off energy of 500 eV was employed. To avoid the interlayer interaction, a vacuum layer of 15Å was added to the slabs. The Brillouin zone was sampled using a Monkhorst-Pack k-point mesh scheme, and the meshes of Γ-centered 13×13×1 and 6×6×1 were used for the unit cell and the 2×2×1 supercell, respectively. The convergence criteria for energy and force were set to be 10−5 eV and 0.01 eV Å-1, respectively. Charge differential analysis combined with the Bader charge method36 was used to quantitatively estimate the charge redistribution and transfer. The climbing image nudged elastic band (CI-NEB) method37 was applied to calculate the potential energy diffusion pathway and the minimum diffusion energy barrier of lithium ions on the 𝑃𝐶𝑥 monolayer. Phonon dispersion spectra was calculated by Phonopy code38. Ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD)39 simulations with Nosé-Hoover thermostat and NVT ensemble were performed at 300 K with the time step of 2 fs.

Results and discussion 3.1 Structures and stability All three DFT-optimized structures of 𝑃𝐶𝑥 (shown in Fig. 1 with all optimized lattice constants shown in Table S1) are quasi-planar, with P atoms located away from the basal plane. 𝑃𝐶2 with the space group of P-1 is constructed with 5-8-5 rings, similar to the case of popgraphene.46 The 5-ring consists one P atom and four C atoms, while the 8-ring is consisted of four P and four C atoms. Each atom (P and C) is coordinated with two C atoms and one P atom. The other two structures are stabilized into two types of hexagonal structure including C6, P2C4 rings for 𝑃𝐶5 and C6, PC5 rings for 𝑃𝐶6 (space group P-3). For 𝑃𝐶5, two types of P2C4 rings (ortho-P and para-P) are aligned in a direction and C6 rings fill up the plane in a zigzag configuration, and each P atom is coordinated with one P atom and two C atoms, similar to the situation of 𝑃𝐶2. For 𝑃𝐶6, on the other hand, each C6 ring is surrounded by six PC5 rings, and each P is coordinated with three C atoms. The quasi-planar nature of 𝑃𝐶𝑥 may provide abundant adsorption sites for practical battery applications.", "page": 6, "position": 0}

The detailed information about ELF plane is shown in Fig. S2. 3.2 Electronic properties The electronic structure of anode material strongly correlates with the battery cyclability and rate performance. Since PBE functional usually underestimates the exact band gap values, here, we use more sophisticated hybrid functional HSE06 to perform the electronic structure calculations. Fig. 3 shows the computed density of states (DOS) and electronic band structures. Both 𝑃𝐶2 and 𝑃𝐶5 monolayers show metallic character with one Dirac cone along the Γ−Y direction (Fig. 3a and 3b) which reveal its intrinsic metallicity and high density of carriers, indicating good electronic conductivity. The major contribution to the DOS of the Dirac bands comes from the C atoms with small contribution from the P atoms. The PC6 monolayer is a direct-gap semiconductor with a band gap of 0.84 eV at the M point (Fig. 3c).

To systematically study the adsorption properties, a 2×2×1 supercell is used to examine the adsorption sites for an isolated Li atom. Several possible high-symmetry adsorption sites are considered (Fig. S3). In 𝑃𝐶2 system, after full structural relaxation, only three inequivalent adsorption sites A1, A2 and A3 are identified. For Li on A1 site, the adsorption energy is -0.94 eV, while for A2 and A3 site, the values are -0.44 eV and -0.87 eV, indicating that A1 is the most favorable adsorption site (Fig. S3a). The adsorption energies are -0.84 and -0.83 eV (Fig. S3b and S3c) for the most favorable A1 sites of PC5 and PC6, respectively. The relatively large adsorption energies of Li atom on 𝑃𝐶𝑥 systems ensure the strong adsorption of Li atoms on the anodes. To visualize the effects of adatom adsorption on the charge distribution, we calculate the differential charge density. Fig. 4 clearly shows the charge transfer from the Li atom to the substrates. Further Bader charge analysis show that each Li transfer 0.89, 0.89, and 0.91 electron to C atoms in 𝑃𝐶2 , 𝑃𝐶5 , and 𝑃𝐶6 , respectively, confirming that the adsorption can be mainly attributed to the interaction between Li and C atom.", "page": 11, "position": 0}

To explore the maximum storage capacity for Li atoms, we consider the adsorption with an increasing number of adsorbed Li atoms on both sides of the 𝑃𝐶𝑥 monolayers in the 2×2 supercell. To obtain more accurate results, both the atomic positions and lattice constants are fully relaxed for the configurations after the intercalation. The Li atoms are inserted into 𝑃𝐶𝑥 systems gradually and randomly until the monolayer reached to its final capacity point. For 𝑃𝐶2 monolayer, two Li atoms can be adsorbed in a single cell at most. Otherwise, the structure will collapse (Fig. S5). Thus, the structural deformation may be caused by the intercalation and deintercalation of Li ions in anodes. Therefore, limiting the deformation which is induced by the Li atoms adsorption is necessary. Here, we conduct a series of AIMD simulations to monitor the structural stability of the Li-intercalated 𝑃𝐶5 and 𝑃𝐶6 nanosheets. Structures with different numbers of adsorbed Li atoms are tested by the simulations to identify the maximum number which does not lead to noticeable deformation of PCx structures at ambient condition. The AIMD results shown in Fig. 6 present the structures with maximum Li atoms for 𝑃𝐶5 and 𝑃𝐶6 and all the original bonds are kept completely intact. To be specific, the maximum adatom number is 4.25 per PC5, i.e. P8C40Li34, over which the structure will collapse (Fig. S6). For, PC6, on the other hand, the maximum adatom number is 4.75 (corresponding to chemical formula P8C48Li38), which is judged by the large distance between new adatom and substrate, so that the chemical interactions are too weak to be considered (Fig. S7)19, 55.

Conclusion In summary, we explore the potential applications of 2D 𝑃𝐶𝑥 (x=2, 5, 6) monolayers as the anode materials for Li-ion batteries by means of DFT calculations and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations. The most energetically favorable diffusion pathways for Li atom in PC2, PC5 and PC6 are identified with considerably low diffusion barriers of 0.18 eV, 0.47 eV and 0.44 eV, respectively, which in turn allows fast charge−discharge rates when they are used as anodes. In addition, PC5 and PC6 monolayer also exhibit high theoretical capacity values of 1251.7 mAh g-1 and 1235.9 mAh g-1, respectively, which are nearly three times that of graphite. These excellent properties suggest that the dynamically stable PC5 and PC6 monolayers could be promising anode materials. Our results give insightful prospects for further experimental work to explore carbon rich PCx monolayers as promising electrode material for Li ion batteries.
