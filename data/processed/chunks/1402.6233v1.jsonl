Lithiated Si and Ge, including their metastable phases, play an important technological rˆole as Li- ion battery (LIB) anodes. The calculations comprise structural optimisations on crystal structures obtained by swapping atomic species to Li-Si and Li-Ge from the X-Y structures in the International Crystal Structure Database, where X={Li,Na,K,Rb,Cs} and Y={Si,Ge,Sn,Pb}. To complement this at various Li-Si and Li-Ge stoichiometries, ab initio random structure searching (AIRSS) was also performed. Between the ground-state stoichiometries, including the recently found Li17Si4 phase, the average voltages were calculated, indicating that germanium may be a safer alternative to silicon anodes in LIB, due to its higher lithium insertion voltage. Calculations predict high-density Li1Si1 and Li1Ge1 P4/mmm layered phases which become the ground state above 2.5 and 5 GPa respectively and reveal silicon and germanium’s propensity to form dumbbells in the LixSi, x = 2.33 −3.25 stoichiometry range. DFT predicts the stability of the Li11Ge6 Cmmm, Li12Ge7 Pnma and Li7Ge3 P3212 phases and several new Li-Ge compounds, with stoichiometries Li5Ge2, Li13Ge5, Li8Ge3 and Li13Ge4. PACS numbers: I. INTRODUCTION Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) are the secondary (recharge- able) battery of choice for portable electronic devices due to their high speciﬁc energy (energy per unit weight) and en- ergy density (energy per unit volume). LIBs have the highest capacity of all the commercially available battery technolo- gies and are now being deployed in hybrid and all-electric vehicles.1 There is substantial interest in enhancing the capac- ity of LIBs, driven by the economic and environmental advan- tages of increasing the range of electric vehicles, and enabling longer-life portable electronic devices.

Lithium intercalated graphite is the standard LIB negative electrode material due to its good rate capability and cycla- bility, but demand for even higher performance LIBs has mo- tivated the investigation of other materials. Silicon is an at- tractive alternative since it has ten times the gravimetric and volumetric capacity of graphite (calculated from the initial mass and volume of silicon) but, unlike graphite, silicon un- dergoes structural changes on lithiation.2–4 The negative elec- trode may be studied using a half-cell containing lithium and silicon. The term “anode” applies to the negative electrode during LIB discharge only, so to avoid confusion we refer to lithiation and delithiation of the silicon half-cell which cor- responds to charging and discharging the LIB respectively. The ﬁrst lithiation of the cell at room temperature involves the conversion of crystalline silicon (c-Si) into an amorphous lithium silicide phase (a-LiySi).5 The onset of amorphiza- tion depends on the lithiation rate and has been measured at ∗Email: ajm255@cam.ac.uk y ≈0.3 in micron-sized (325 mesh) silicon clusters after irre- versible SEI (solid-electrolyte interphase) formation has been taken into account.6,7 Below a discharge voltage of 50 mV the a-LiySi crystallizes to form a metastable Li15Si4 phase which may become non-stoichiometric, Li15±δSi4, at deep discharge.6 However, at temperatures above 100oC it is pos- sible to form the most lithiated crystalline phase, Li21Si5, electrochemically.8 Full lithiation of silicon leads to a drastic volume expansion of 270–280%,9 which generates consider- able mechanical stress.

The clusters that form only break apart into isolated silicon atoms at the end of the lithiation process (below 80 mV).13 Many of the disordered structures that form during lithi- ation can be approximated by the Li-Si ground-state and metastable crystalline phases. For instance, the crystalline phases have been used as a ﬁrst step in understanding charge transfer17 and average lithiation voltages.45 To gain insight into the possible types of silicon clusters present and their en- vironments in a-LiySi, various crystalline phases have been investigated and categorized using NMR6,14 and ab initio theoretical techniques.15–18 These c-Li-Si phases have pre- viously been well categorized using density-functional the- ory (DFT),15–17 however new insights into the most lithi-", "page": 0, "position": 2}

The most recent phase diagram of the Li-Si sys- tem shows, in ascending lithium content order, c-Si, Li1Si1, Li12Si7, Li7Si3, Li13Si4, Li15Si4, Li22Si5, and β-Li.19 Addi- tionally investigations by Zeilinger and coworkers have pre- sented a high-temperature Li4.11Si phase18,20 and suggested Li17Si4 as the correct stoichiometry of Li21Si5/Li22Si5. Germanium is another choice of anode for LIB with a theo- retical capacity of 1568 mAh g−1 some 5 times greater than carbon. Its lithium diffusivity at room temperature is 400 times greater than silicon,21 however it is scarcer and con- sequently more expensive. About the Li-Ge phase diagram, much less is known. In increasing order of lithium content, the following stable phases have all been proposed: Li7Ge12,22 Li1Ge1,23,24 Li12Ge7,22 Li11Ge6,25 Li9Ge4,26–28 Li7Ge3,22,27 Li7Ge2,28,29 Li15Ge4,27,28,30,31 Li17Ge432 and Li22Ge5.27,28,33 More crystalline phases occur during electrochemical lithi- ation of germanium than silicon; XRD and HRTEM mea- surements show that during lithiation of germanium at room temperature, the Li-Ge system progressed through Li9Ge4, Li7Ge2 and a mixture of Li15Ge4 and Li22Ge5.28 In this article we use atomic species swapping along with random structure searching techniques, described in Sec. II, to predict ground state and metastable crystal structures of the Li-Si and and Li-Ge systems. In Sec. III our approach to calculating average voltages is discussed and Secs IV and V describe the DFT-predicted phases of Li-Si and Li-Ge respec- tively. In the Li-Si system we predict a high-density Li1Si1 phase with P4/mmm symmetry and discuss the tendency for silicon to form dumbbells within the lithium silicides.

AIRSS searches were performed for stoichiometries LixSiy and LixGey where x,y = 1 −8. Relaxations were performed using the stoichiometric crys- tal structures of Li-Si, Li-Ge, Li-Sn, Li-Pb, Na-Si, Na-Ge, Na-Sn, Na-Pb, K-Si, K-Ge, K-Sn and K-Pb. First, the struc- tures were obtained from the International Crystallographic Structure Database (ICSD). Second, for each structure the anions were replaced with Li and the cations replaced with {Si,Ge}. The structures were relaxed to local-energy minima using forces and stresses calculated by DFT. Calculations were performed using the plane wave CASTEP DFT code.43 The PBE (Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof) exchange- correlation functional was used with Vanderbilt “ultrasoft” pseudopotentials. The Li-Si system required a basis set con- taining plane waves with energies of up to 400 eV and a Monkhorst-Pack (MP) grid corresponding to a Brillouin zone (BZ) sampling grid ﬁner than 2π × 0.05 ˚A−1.

Drawing a convex hull from (CLi,E f /A) = (0,0) to (1,0), that is, between the chemical potentials, reveals the stable zero Kelvin structures at the ver- tices of the tie-lines. III. VOLTAGES We calculate average voltages in an LIB anode using DFT total energies by assuming that all the displaced charge is due to Li and that the reaction proceeds sequentially through the phases on the tie-lines of the convex hull, i.e. it is a succession of two-phase reactions.44 The voltage is given by, V = −∆G ∆x , (3) where the Gibbs free energy change, ∆G is in eV and ∆x is the change in the number of lithium atoms per silicon atoms in the 2 phases. The Gibbs free energy is composed of a number of terms, ∆G = ∆E + P∆V −T∆S, (4) where ∆E is the total electronic energy, and P, ∆V, T and ∆S are the pressure, change in volume, thermodynamic tempera- ture and change in entropy respectively. Due to the difﬁculty in calculating ∆G we make the approximation, previously ap- plied to the Li-Si system, that ∆G ≈∆E since ∆E is of the or- der of a few electron volts, P∆V ≈10−5 eV and T∆S ≈0.06 eV at 425 oC.45–47", "page": 1, "position": 2}

RESULTS - LITHIUM SILICIDE We ﬁnd on the convex hull, shown Fig. 1, in increas- ing lithium content order; diamond-structure Fd3m c-Si; the I41/a Li1Si1 phase48,49 which has recently been synthesized at ambient pressure50 and is discussed in Sec. IV A; the Pnma Li12Si7 phase51 which contains silicon 5-membered rings and 4-membered stars, which have been studied using NMR;14 the Li7Si3 and Li5Si2 phases with P3212 and R3m symmetries re- spectively discussed further in Sec. IV B; the Pbam Li13Si4 phase; the metastable I43d Li15Si4; and the Li17Si4 F43m symmetry phase discussed further in Sec. IV C. For Li15Si4, Mulikan analysis yields a charge of 0.15|e| and −0.57|e| per Li and Si respectively; in agreement with Bader analysis that Li is a cation17 and contrary to the reports that Li is anionic.52 The average voltage was calculated between all adjacent pairs of stable Li-Si phases on the convex hull including both the Li17Si4 phase and Li1Si1 phase recently synthesized at am- bient pressure. Voltages were obtained from the DFT total en- ergies, as described in Sec. III and referenced to lithium metal.

The DFT ground state at 0 GPa is a I41/a phase comprising a 3- fold coordinated silicon network hosting lithium tetrahedra similar to the {4Li,V} Zintl defect in silicon.42 Recently the I41/a phase has been synthesized via ball-milling and shown to be stable under ambient conditions.50 Mulikan analysis yields a charge of 0.34|e| for each Li and −0.34|e| for each Si establishing Li as cationic contrary to a previous analysis.49 DFT predicts a novel P4/mmm phase with a formation en- ergy of 0.07 eV p.f.u. at 0 GPa. It is a layered structure com- prising a two-dimensional (non-tetrahedrally) four-fold coor- dinated silicon lattice with lithium intercalated between the silicon sheets. Since the silicon is four-fold coordinated it gains less of the lithium’s charge than in the I41/a phase; Mu- likan analysis shows lithium atoms donate 0.22|e| each. Our calculations show the Li1Si1 system undergoes a phase transi- tion from the I41/a to the P4/mmm phase at 2.5 GPa. The I41/amd phase is isostructural to its Li1Ge1 analogue. Li1Ge1 I41/amd is stable at high pressure,24 however Li1Si1 I41/amd is not globally stable over the pressure range we studied (between 0 and 10 GPa). The P3m1 phase contains 6 membered rings of 3-fold co- ordinated silicon atoms in layered sheets, see Fig 2. The sili- con network is isostructural to silicene, a silicon analogue of graphene. We calculate that silicene and a phase based on the P4/mmm silicon network are 0.63 and 0.89 eV p.f.u. re- spectively above the Fd3m ground state.

Li7Si3 and Li5Si2 Lithium’s position in the crystal lattice can be difﬁcult to establish due to its low XRD scattering factor. Furthermore, Li7Si3 has partially occupied lattice sites53 making it difﬁcult to model using DFT. Its structure may be represented as a su- percell of R3m Li5Si2 in which lithium atoms have been re- moved from certain lattice sites.54 By choosing different com- binations of lithium sites in the supercell, models of Li7Si3 can be produced with P3m1, C2/m Cm and P3212 symme- tries. The latter, labeled “#2” by Dahn et al.,17 is found on the convex hull. It is unsurprising that at zero Kelvin, DFT also predicts that the R3m Li5Si2 phase to be stable since it contains entirely occupied lithium sites. Tipton et al. also found this phase to be stable using DFT.47 C. Most lithiated phases The most lithiated stable Li-Si phase has been the sub- ject of debate. XRD measurements predict that Li21Si555 is stable at room temperature and Li22Si5 at 415oC3. Previ- ous DFT calculations predict Li21Si5 to be the stabler phase, even after the inclusion of temperature dependence using the harmonic approximation.17 The combined AIRSS/species- swapping technique predicts Li21Si5 and Li22Si5 to be locally stable but above the convex hull.

They belong to the set of structures in the range Li7Si3 →Li13Si5 which all contain silicon dumb- bells.

The columns are packed together realizing the three-dimensional structure. The repeating unit(s) in each column are represented between parentheses, and silicon dumb- bells are indicated by Si-Si. For example, a structure comprising columns containing a repeating unit of 5 lithium atoms followed by a silicon dumbbell is represented as (5×Li + Si-Si).

RESULTS - LITHIUM GERMANIDE In order of lithium content, the following Li-Ge phases have all been proposed: Li7Ge12, Li1Ge1, Li12Ge7, Li11Ge6, Li9Ge4, Li7Ge3, Li7Ge2, Li15Ge4, Li17Ge4 and Li22Ge5. Be- low we compare in detail the known phases to the results of the DFT searches. Li7Ge12 is the only reported phase with a ratio of Li/Ge less than 1. It has two symmetries associated with it, originally Pmn2122,60, which was later disputed,58 and more recently, P2/n.61 Four of its lithium lattice sites are 50% occupied. We model its structure in a periodic lattice using a simulation cell containing 28 Li and 48 Ge sites. The fractionally occupied sites can be ﬁlled in a variety of ways: all sites, giving rise to a crystal symmetry P2/c: one site (P1), four different ways (all degenerate): two sites, 6 ways (Pc, P2 or P1) each sym- metry being doubly degenerate): three sites (P1) four ways (all degenerate): and by leaving all empty (P2/c) one way. A convex hull of their single point energies shows that the (Pc) version is the most stable, hence we use this throughout the rest of the calculations.

Nesper et al.62 claim that the phase is actually Li8MgGe6, suggesting that since Li8MgGe6 has a molecular volume of 166.5 cm3mol−1 it is unlikely that Li11Ge6 could have two more atoms per formula unit.73 DFT also ﬁnds a Li11Ge6 Cmcm phase slightly above the tie-line with a volume of 286.26 ˚A3 per f.u., which corresponds to a molecular volume of 172.4 cm3mol−1. Hence it seems en- tirely possible to us that Li11Ge6 Cmcm was synthesized by Frank et al. as initially proposed. Li9Ge4 in theCmcm symmetry group, have been made elec- trochemically and from high temperature fusion,27,28,58 but all of our calculations show it well above the tie line, favoring disproportion into a P3212 Li7Ge3 phase. Li7Ge3 with P3212 symmetry was ﬁrst mentioned by ref. 22 but no supporting information was given.

Li5Ge2 is above the tie-line and Li13Ge5 and Li8Ge3 are all stable al- though to the best of our knowledge they have not previously been presented in the literature. This may be due to thermal effects, see the discussion of similar arguments for Li5Si2 in Sec. IV B. Li16Ge5 was predicted by St. John, et al.65 during electrochemical studies. They presented no crystal structure nor is there any prototype structure of {Li/Na}{Si/Ge/Sn/Pb} with this stoichiometry. DFT predicts a Li13Ge4 Pbam phase, isostructural with the Li13Si4 phase which is slightly above the tie-line and with a similar Li:Si ratio to Li16Ge5. Recently preliminary results by H. Jung et al.63 have produced electro- chemically new phases in the Li2.33Ge - Li3.5Ge range whose X-ray pair distribution functions (PDF) match at least one of our predicted phases. A fuller investigation will be presented later. The Li7Ge2 phase with Cmmm symmetry can be made electrochemically and by annealing from high temperature melt.28,58 DFT-GGA predicts the P3m1 phase above the tie- line and 0.08 eV/f.u more stable than the Cmmm phase. This discrepancy remains after using harder pseudopotentials and either the LDA exchange-correlation or the HSE06 hybrid functional.69 A fuller investigation into this will be presented elsewhere. We ﬁnd the well known Li15Ge4 stoichiometry I43d phase stable.27,28,30,31 The most lithiated phase has been a matter of debate in all Li-Group 4 compounds including germanium. Its stoichiometry was reported as Li22Ge5 with F23 symmetry,33 due to its similarity to Li22Pb4.70 More recently, Goward et al.32 studied this family of structures and show that for the Ge, Sn and Pb", "page": 5, "position": 1}

The Li-Ge results are at a higher average voltage. structures that are likely to be thermally accessible at room temperature, that is, those at a local minima on the DFT po- tential energy surface which reside on, or close to, the convex hull. These structures serve as a model for the clustering and bonding behavior of electrochemically lithiated silicon and germanium.71 The Li-Si system was used to validate our method: DFT ﬁnds all of the known phases as local energy minima includ- ing independently uncovering the Li17Si4 phase. For the Li- Ge system, DFT ﬁnds Li5Ge2, Li8Ge3, Li13Ge5 and Li13Ge4 locally stable and, to the best of our knowledge, these have not been presented in the literature before. DFT predicts that Li7Ge12 and Li11Ge6 are local energy minima; the former having Pc symmetry and the latter Cmcm. It was reported that Li11Ge6 may be produced from a high-temperature melt25 but this has been disputed.62 Also at local energy minima are the Li12Ge7 Pnma and Li7Ge3 P3212 phases, which were sug- gested by Gr¨uttner22 but without presenting the crystal struc- ture. An unknown phase was found by heating ball milled Li-Ge, its XRD pattern ﬁts an Li7Ge3 phase with R3m sym- metry. Since DFT and Gr¨uttner both predict Li7Ge3 has P3212 symmetry, we propose that the unknown phase may be either the Li5Ge2 or Li8Ge3 phases which have a similar stoichiom- etry to Li7Ge3 and both of which DFT predicts to have R3m symmetry. For the Li-Si and Li-Ge structures on the tie-lines, the av- erage voltages were calculated relative to lithium metal. This included for the ﬁrst time Li17Si4 and Li1Si1.

The average voltages are in good agreement with both previous calcula- tions and experiment. They are higher in Li-Ge than Li-Si, implying that germanium has a lower energy density than sili- con. However the higher insertion voltage is safer during lithi- ation, reducing the chance of lithium plating which can result in dendrites short circuiting the cell. Lithium in germanium also has higher diffusivity than in silicon. Li1Si1 was previously only synthesisable at high pres- sure but has recently been synthesized by highly ener- getic ball milling, remotivating interest in the high-pressure phases. AIRSS searches predict a selection of higher en- ergy Li1Si1 and Li1Ge1 phases. At lower pressures three- dimensional three-fold coordinated silicon/germanium net- works were prevalent. However, at higher densities, both sil- icon and germanium exhibited a P4/mmm structure compris- ing ﬂat sheets of four-fold coordinated silicon and germanium atoms respectively. These became the most stable phase of Li1Si1 and Li1Ge1 at 2.5 GPa and 5 GPa respectively. Given the interest in silicene our layered compounds might provide an alternative route to layered silicon. A LIB does not necessarily have time to equilibrate thermo- dynamically over large length scales.6 The ability to generate a wide range of locally-stable low-energy structures above the ground state allows us to visualize the types of clusters which form in the LIB during cycling. Over a lithiation range of LixSi, x = 2.33−3.25 we found that the structures present ex- hibited Si-Si dumbbells. At higher lithiation all of the silicon dumbbells break up and the crystalline Li15Si4 phase forms. Since these dumbbells were seen in both ground state and metastable phases is seems likely that they will exist in LIB anodes, probably in a lower symmetry solid solution.

Further- more we ﬁnd the analogous dumbbell containing structures in the Li-Ge system. Above we have demonstrated that the combination of both atomic species swapping the ICSD phases and AIRSS is a powerful tool for predicting the crystal structures of LIB elec- trode materials. A reﬁnement to the method combines these two techniques by using results of the AIRSS searches as in- puts to the species swapping technique. For example, the low-energy structures found by AIRSS in Li1Si1 were re- optimized as candidate Li1Ge1 phases in the Li-Ge system. Our method has only provided results of the stable and metastable structures at 0 K, of course, the effect of temper- ature could be included post hoc using phonon calculations within the harmonic approximation and beyond. Our method serves as a crucial ﬁrst step in ab initio materials discovery and design.
