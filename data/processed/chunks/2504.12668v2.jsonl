Recent modeling study reported the formation of wurtzite LiF below ~550 K (J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2023, 145, 1327-1333), in contrast to experimental observation of rocksalt LiF under ambient conditions. To address this discrepancy, we employ molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with a refined machine-learned force field (MLFF), and demonstrate the nucleation and crystallization of rocksalt LiF from the molten phase at temperatures below ~800 K. The rocksalt phase remains stable in LiF nanoparticles. Complementary density functional theory (DFT) calculations show that dispersion interactions are essential for correctly predicting the thermodynamic stability of rocksalt LiF over the wurtzite phase on top of the commonly used PBE functional.

Introduction As global energy demand escalates and the urgency to mitigate fossil fuel reliance intensifies, the development of advanced sustainable technologies, especially those of enhanced energy density, has become critical to address the fast-approaching physicochemical limitations of conventional lithium (Li)-ion batteries.1-3 Innovations such as Li metal anodes, high-voltage cathode materials, and next-generation electrolytes—including advanced liquid electrolytes4,5 and solid-state electrolytes6 — have emerged as promising solutions. However, Li metal anode and high-voltage cathode face significant interfacial challenges,7-9 such as dendrite growth and parasitic side reactions,10-12 which degrade battery performance, accelerate capacity fade, and pose safety risks. In this context, the formation of a robust solid-state electrolyte interphase (SEI)13, which is ionically conductive yet electronically insulating, is essential for stabilizing the Li metal anode. Simultaneously, a stable cathode-electrolyte interphase (CEI)14 is necessary to enable the practical application of high-voltage cathodes (Figure 1a). Lithium fluoride (LiF) with rocksalt structure (Figure 1b) stands out as a critical component in both SEI and CEI layers owing to its exceptional mechanical robustness, superior electrical insulation properties, and wide electrochemical stability window, which collectively contribute to the enhanced battery performance and prolonged cycle", "page": 2, "position": 0}

Therefore, rigorous validation against both DFT calculations and experimental observations—spanning both structural and dynamic properties—is essential to ensure the reliability of the MLFFs.33-35 A recent MD study31 with MLFFs investigated atomic structures and lithium-ion transport behavior in amorphous inorganic SEI components composed of LiF and Li2CO3, in which it was found that the presence of Li2CO3 suppresses the nucleation and crystallization of LiF, thereby promoting the ionic conductivity of SEI. In absence of Li2CO3, LiF was found to crystallize into the wurtzite phase, characterized by Li-F tetrahedra, at temperatures below ~550 K. While this study offers valuable insights into the impact of the local environmental on Li ion diffusion in the major SEI components, one must notice that the computational observation of wurtzite LiF (P6ଷmc , Space Group 186, Figure 1c) stands against the experimental observation of rocksalt LiF (Fm3തm, Space Group 225, Figure 1b)36 under ambient condition. The rocksalt LiF remains stable even under extreme pressures (up to 100 GPa) and temperatures approaching its melting point.37,38 In this work, we have conducted comprehensive DFT calculations to identify the thermodynamically stable phases of LiF, alongside molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with a refined MLFF to observe the nucleation and crystallization of rocksalt LiF from its molten state.

This finding is further supported by calculations using the regularized version of the strongly constrained and appropriately normed functional (r2SCAN)41. These results suggest that the dispersion interaction must be explicitly considered during the training of MLFFs for accurate phase stability predictions. Additionally, we demonstrate that the incorporation of virial stress during force field training is essential to observe the nucleation and crystallization processes of rocksalt LiF in MD simulations. Leveraging advancements in our refined MLFF, we achieved high-fidelity MD trajectories over tens of nanoseconds, enabling direct observation of the nucleation of rocksalt LiF and its subsequent crystallization from the molten state. With these findings, we highly recommend that one carefully validates the choice of DFT method, the force field training process and the MLFF-informed molecular dynamics simulations. 2.

The simulations utilized the Stochastic Cell Rescaling (SCR) barostat60 in conjunction with the Bussi-Donadio- Parrinello (BDP) thermostat.61 The linear and angular momenta were set to zero every 10 steps to prevent system drift. To assess the equilibration behavior of large-scale systems in the transition region, we extracted initial configurations at 800 K, 825 K, and 850 K and conducted extended NPT simulations for 50 ns. Additionally, to investigate the crystallization behavior of LiF in vacuum, molten LiF clusters containing 960, 480, 120, 60, and 30 atoms were placed in enlarged boxes with ~20 Å spacing between periodic images.

Results and discussions The LiF crystallizes in the rocksalt structure with Fm3തm space group (No.225, Figure 1b) and its lattice parameter is 4.026 Å .36 In this structure, Li+ and F- ions occupy alternating octahedral sites, forming the NaCl-type arrangement stabilized by strong ionic bonding. LiF has a high melting point (~1118 K)37 and a low thermal expansion coefficient38. The fully relaxed atomic structures and the energies were calculated with different DFT methods for rocksalt LiF (Figure 2 and Table S1). The PBE functional slightly overestimates the lattice parameters, while the local density approximation (LDA), PBE-D3 and r2SCAN functionals slightly underestimate the lattice parameters compared to experimental values. The two characteristic angles in the Li-F octahedron of rocksalt LiF (𝜙ൎ180° and 𝜃ൎ90°) are illustrated in Figure 1b. In addition to rocksalt phase, three hypothetical polymorphs of LiF have been proposed: the wurtzite structure (Figure 1c), the body-centered cubic (bcc) CsCl-type structure (Figure S1a) and the cubic zinc blende structure (Figure S1b).

In contrast, the LDA, r2SCAN and r2SCAN+rVV10 functionals correctly determine the energy preference of rocksalt phase. As a meta-GGA functional, r2SCAN holds good transferable accuracy41 and thus has been treated as reliable reference for predicting the energy order between different polymorphs.

For this reason, we adopted the SCR-BDP approach for reporting MLMD results in the main text. The evolution of Li-6F coordination units during nucleation is illustrated in Figure 5d. Trends in Li ion diffusivity and mean squared displacement (MSD) as a function of temperature are presented in Figure S15, showing good agreement with the M5-PBE- D3-virial results. To further validate the findings, we constructed a larger simulation cell comprising 7680 atoms (2 ൈ2 ൈ2 replication of the 960-atom cell) and conducted NPT simulations. The corresponding results are shown in Figure S16. In this case, the phase transition occurred upon cooling to 775 K, 25 K lower than that observed in the smaller cell. Given the larger system size, structures obtained at 800 K, 825 K, and 850 K were extracted and further equilibrated independently for 50 ns to assess phase transition behavior. As expected, crystallization was observed for the 825 K and 800 K trajectories at 5.4 ns and 1.15 ns, respectively, reflecting the stochastic nature of nucleation and the necessity of extended simulation times for larger systems. To quantitatively assess structural compactness, we performed vacuum volume analysis (details in Supplementary Information). According to our criteria, vacuum space was defined as the existence of interatomic distances exceeding 5 Å between non-", "page": 23, "position": 0}

All octahedron-containing structures exhibited some degree of vacuum space, whereas tetrahedron-containing structures do not, which was due to the density increase effect of forming Li-6F units. Compared to the defected NVT case, the NPT ensemble reduced but did not fully eliminate the vacuum formed during crystallization. This suggests that the suppression of phase transitions in the LiF and Li2CO3 mixture wound potentially not only prevent Li diffusion drops caused by LiF ordering,31 but also minimize potential vacuum formation, which could otherwise degrade anode performance. Finally, we examined the crystallization behavior of molten LiF clusters of various sizes in vacuum (~20 Å separation between periodic images) under the same cooling protocols to determine the preferred surface geometry of LiF. As shown in Figure 6, all crystalized clusters (60 to 960 atoms) exhibited rocksalt-type structures, with no sign of wurtzite-like features, confirming the structural dominance of the rocksalt phase. In contrast, the 30-atom cluster failed to crystalize but kept transforming from one configuration to another during the simulation even at 300 K (Figure S18), which can be ascribed to the fact that these configurations were close in energies as reported by previous DFT studies.69", "page": 24, "position": 0}

Complementary SSNEB calculations using PBE-D3 revealed a kinetic barrier of approximately 0.16 eV per formula unit for the transition from rocksalt to wurtzite LiF, further confirming the kinetic and thermodynamic stability of the rocksalt structure under ambient conditions. In addition, simulations of LiF clusters in vacuum showed that rocksalt symmetry is retained down to cluster sizes of approximately 60 atoms, highlighting the intrinsic structural preference of LiF. Collectively, these findings underscore the critical role of dispersion interactions and virial stress information in DFT calculations and MLMD simulations. We therefore emphasize the importance of selecting appropriate exchange- correlation functionals, rigorously training force fields, and carefully validating MD protocols when modeling battery materials and related solid-state systems.
