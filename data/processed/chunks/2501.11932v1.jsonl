Novel solvents are essential for enhancing electrolyte structure and ensuring better integration with modern electrode systems. However, there are limited studies focused on fluorinated solvent-based electrolytes. Herein, we report a new weakly solvated ether electrolyte (WSEE) composed of a pure fluorinated ether solvent, which results in an anion-rich solvation structure even at a low salt concentration of 1M. To explore this, we selected the advanced fluorinated solvent 2,2-Difluoroethyl Methyl Ether (FEME) and compared it with Dipropyl Ether (DPE), Ethylene Carbonate (EC), and Diethyl Carbonate (DEC). The prepared electrolyte systems include DPE with 1M, 1.8M, and 4M LiFSI, FEME with 1M, 1.8M, and 4M LiFSI, and a 1:1 vol% EC/DEC mixture containing 1M LiPF6. In this work, we comprehensively investigate the Li+ solvation structures in these electrolytes using Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations and Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations. Our computational findings indicate the presence of large ion aggregates (AGGs) in each DPE- and FEME-based electrolyte, while SSIPs (68%) are the dominant species in the mixed EC/DEC electrolyte. Notably, the formation of large ion aggregates is more pronounced in FEME-based electrolytes. The dominant solvation structures in the ether-based electrolytes are the anion-rich complexes Li+(FSI– )3(DPE)1 and Li+(FSI– )3(FEME)1. We find that, similar to DPE, FEME solvent also exhibits weak solvating power across all examined salt concentrations. More specifically, we find that FEME has weaker solvating power than DPE. This behavior is predicted by MD simulations, which indicate a strong preference for Li+ ions to coordinate with FSI– anions within the primary solvation shell. We also observe that the number of unique solvation structures in the ether-based electrolytes increases with salt concentration, with FEME+LiFSI showing slightly more unique solvation structures than DPE+LiFSI. Furthermore, the quantum mechanical features of the Li+ solvation structures in DPE+1.8M LiFSI, FEME+1.8M LiFSI, and EC/DEC+1M LiPF6 electrolytes have been analyzed in detail using DFT calculations.

As the demand for longer-lasting and safer batteries grows, opti- mizing the electrolyte has become a critical research focus8. To achieve this, frameworks are currently being developed to enable efficient searches for electrolyte materials9–11. The structure and dynamics of the electrolyte, particularly the solvation environ- ment around Li+, play a vital role in determining key battery properties, including ion conductivity, electrochemical stability, and solid-electrolyte-interphase (SEI) layer formation on the elec- trodes12–14.

Therefore, a thorough understanding of the solvation structure is important for the development of improved electrolytes. Various analytical and computational techniques, in- cluding FTIR15–21, Raman22–24, NMR spectroscopy20–22,25, DFT calculations19–21,26–28, and MD simulations29–34 have been uti- lized to investigate the solvation structures. As mentioned above, the movement of Li+ ions through the electrolyte is widely recognized as a crucial factor influencing the rate at which energy is transferred to the electrodes35. According to the literature, Li+ ion transport occurs in two stages: first, the Li+ ions become surrounded by solvent molecules, and then these solvated ions proceed to migrate36. Gaining deeper insights into the solvation and transport behavior of Li+ ions can enable the development of improved electrolytes. Recent studies highlight the importance of understanding the solvation structure of elec- trolytes and its impact on battery performance37,38. Specifically, weakly solvated ether electrolytes (WSEEs) have been shown to exhibit anion-rich solvation structures, which have attracted sig- nificant attention39,40. In contrast, carbonate-based electrolytes, widely used in commercial lithium-ion batteries, often feature solvent-separated ion pairs (SSIPs) as the dominant solvation species due to their high solvation power36,41. As reported in the literature, the SEI layer plays an important role in enhancing the performance of LIBs1,42. This enhancement is largely attributed to the SEI’s ability to regulate Li+ ion migra- tion at the electrode-electrolyte interface, which is governed by its composition and physicochemical properties43,44. Among its key features, the LiF-rich SEI layer functions as a robust protective shell on the electrode surface41. Notably, an anion-rich solvation shell is known to facilitate the development of such LiF-rich SEI layers45. Based on this insight, we have designed a novel fluo- rinated ether-based electrolyte featuring an anion-abundant sol- vation structure to promote the formation of these desirable SEI layers. In this study, we computationally investigate LiFSI-based non- aqueous electrolytes in fluorinated and non-fluorinated ether sol- vents, alongside LiPF6-based non-aqueous electrolytes in mixed carbonate solvents.

The investigation includes a series of sol- vents: DPE, FEME, EC, and DEC. For ether-based electrolytes, a broad range of salt concentrations (1M, 1.8M, and 4M) was se- lected, while for the mixed carbonate electrolyte, only 1M was studied. Our results demonstrate that DPE- and FEME-based electrolytes exhibit anion-rich solvation structures even at a low salt concentration of 1M, with the results for the DPE electrolyte aligning with previous studies45. In contrast, the mixed car- bonate electrolyte predominantly features homogeneously dis- persed SSIPs46. We begin by analyzing the electronic properties of the salt and solvent molecules including HOMO/LUMO distri- butions and electrostatic potential (ESP) maps to evaluate their chemical stability within the electrolyte. Next, fluorinated, non- fluorinated, and mixed carbonate-based electrolyte systems are modeled using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to derive key properties of interest. Radial distribution functions (RDFs) and coordination numbers (CNs) are then calculated to provide insight into the solvation structure of these systems. The solva- tion structures of lithium ions are examined in detail, with a fo- cus on the composition of the primary solvation shell, including the number of solvent molecules and anions. Additionally, the presence of solvent-separated ion pairs (SSIPs), contact ion pairs (CIPs), and aggregated species (AGGs) is analyzed for each elec- trolyte. Electronic characteristics of Li+ solvation structures are further explored using charge density difference analysis, Bader charge calculations, electrostatic potential map, binding energy, and HOMO/LUMO distributions derived from Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations.

The selected sol- vents were dipropyl ether (DPE), 2,2-difluoroethyl methyl ether (FEME), ethylene carbonate (EC), and diethyl carbonate (DEC). Herein, seven types of electrolytes were studied: DPE+1M LiFSI, DPE+1.8M LiFSI, DPE+4M LiFSI, FEME+1M LiFSI, FEME+1.8M LiFSI, FEME+4M LiFSI, and 1:1 vol% EC/DEC+1M LiPF6. The Li+ solvation structures in these electrolytes were investigated using classical Molecular Dynamics (MD) and Density Functional Theory (DFT) simulations.

For the FEME+1M LiFSI, FEME+1.8M LiFSI, and FEME+4M LiFSI systems, the ions were randomly placed among 787 sol- vent molecules. Similarly, the 1:1 vol% EC/DEC+1M LiPF6 sys- tem contained 875 solvent molecules with Li+ and PF – 6 ions arranged in a non-uniform manner. Table 1 shows the den- sity and molar mass of the solvent molecules47,48.

For a single solvent sys- tem, it is assumed that the simulation box is filled with either DPE or FEME solvent, and in that case, solvent2 from the equation can be ignored. Here, solventAtom/saltAtom is the number of atoms in each solvent/salt molecule and solventMolecule/saltMolecule is the number of solvent/salt molecules present in the system. The number of atoms in DPE, FEME, EC, DEC, LiFSI, and LiPF6 molecule are 21, 12, 10, 18, 10, and 8, respectively. Nsolvent = m M ×NA where, m = ρ ×V (1) Nsalt = (c×V ×NA)×1000 (2) The initial configurations of these seven electrolyte systems were modeled using the PACKMOL49 package by randomly plac- ing the solvent molecules, FSI– , PF – 6 , and Li+ in a 5×5×5 nm3 cubic simulation box. Atomic and ionic interactions in the DPE- LiFSI, FEME-LiFSI, and EC-DEC-LiPF6 systems were described by the OPLS-AA (Optimized Potentials for Liquid Simulations All Atom)50,51 and ionic liquids force field. The bonded and non- bonded parameters of the OPLS-AA force field for the DPE, FEME, EC, and DEC solvent molecule atoms were obtained from LigPar- Gen52–54, while the force field parameters for FSI– , PF – 6 , and Li+ ions have been obtained from a database of several ionic liq- uids55,56. This OPLS-AA force field has been extensively validated for modeling lithium-ion battery electrolytes and offers a favor- able balance between accuracy and computational efficiency. The functional form of the OPLS force field is defined by a set of potential functions36 from Equations 3 to 9, which include: Etotal(rN) = Ebonded +Enonbonded (3) Ebonded = Ebonds +Eangles +Edihedrals +Eimpropers (4) Ebonds = ∑ bonds Kr(r −r0)2 (5) Eangles = ∑ angles Kθ(θ −θ0)2 (6) Edihedrals = ∑ dihedrals V [1+cos(nϕ −d)] (7) Eimpropers = ∑ impropers V [1+d cos(nϕ)] (8) Enonbonded = ∑ i>j 4εij \"\u0012σij rij \u001312 − \u0012σij rij \u00136# +∑ i>j Cqiqj εri j (9) Where, εij = pεiiεj j and σij = σii +σ j j 2 In MD simulations, interactions within molecules are divided into bonded and non-bonded interactions.

Bonded interactions, which include bonds, angles, dihedrals, and impropers, are mod- eled using harmonic functions. Non-bonded interactions include Van der Waals forces and Coulombic forces, which describe the behavior between atoms not directly bonded to each other. The dihedral term captures the torsional motion of four consecutively bonded atoms, and the improper term describes the torsional mo- tion of three atoms arranged around a central fourth atom. All MD simulations were performed using the LAMMPS57 https://lammps.org open-source software (version 23 Jun 2022). Lennard-Jones and Coulombic forces interactions were cut off at a distance of 1.2 nm. Coulombic forces beyond the cutoff were computed using the particle-particle particle-mesh (PPPM)58 method to account for the long-range electrostatic interactions with a relative error in forces of 1 × 10−5. Periodicity was ap- plied in all the x, y, z dimensions of the cubic simulation box. The equilibration procedure and production run are outlined as follows45. First, the prepared systems from PACKMOL software were minimized using the steepest descent (SD) method with a convergence criterion of 1000 kcal/mol·Å, followed by conjugate gradient (CG) minimization with a convergence criterion of 10 kcal/mol · Å. Minimization algorithms were used to reduce the system’s energy and prevent particle overlap. The systems were then equilibrated at a temperature of 298.15 K and a pressure of 1 atm in the isobaric-isothermal (NPT) ensemble using a time step of 1 fs for 2 ns in order to stabilize the potential energy and density of the systems. During equilibration, bond constraints were applied to specified bond length in the simulation using the SHAKE algorithm59.

This setup ensures sufficient vacuum distance without significantly increasing the computa- tional cost. In this study, all DFT calculations were conducted in vacuum. Both the geometry optimization and single point energy calculation also called the self-consistent field (SCF) calculation were performed using non-spin-polarized calculation. The elec- tronic structure information was obtained from SCF calculations performed on the optimized structures. This includes the elec- trostatic potential (ESP) map, HOMO/LUMO distribution, Bader charge analysis, and charge density difference (CDD) of all the studied molecules and solvation structures45,69–75. The binding energies were also calculated using DFT in vacuum with cluster models45,76,77.

The Li+−solvent and Li+−anion pairwise interactions follow similar trends in each ether electrolyte but exhibit opposite trends in car- bonate electrolyte (Fig. 3, 4, and Table 3). In mixed EC/DEC elec- trolyte, DEC solvents exhibit stronger coordination with Li+ com- pared to EC, as indicated by the sharp RDF peaks of Li+−O(DEC) (Fig. 3a and 3b)20,46. Conversely, the minimal Li+−F(PF – 6 ) RDF peaks suggest that the PF – 6 anion has little influence on Li+ solvation structures (Fig. 3c and 3d). On the other hand, Fig. 3 shows that in both DPE and FEME electrolytes, due to their weak solvating power as indicated by the negligible RDF peaks of Li+−O(DPE) and Li+−O(FEME), DPE and FEME sol- vents do not strongly interact with the cations. This allows Li+ to form strong interactions with the FSI– anion in the primary sol- vation shell (r ≈2.09 Å), as shown by the pronounced RDF peaks of Li+−O(FSI– )45,82,89,90. From Fig. 3a, 3c, and Table 3, in both DPE and FEME electrolytes, as salt concentration increases, the maximum RDF peaks for Li+−O(DPE) and Li+−O(FEME) increase, while those for Li+−O(FSI– ) decrease. It is found that the maximum RDF peaks of Li+−O(FSI– ) are consistently higher than those of Li+−O(DPE) and Li+−O(FEME), which fur- ther confirms the weak solvating power of DPE and FEME sol- vents across varying salt concentrations. Additionally, the lower RDF peaks and coordination number of Li+−O(FEME) compared to Li+−O(DPE) suggest that FEME has weaker solvating power than DPE.

Additionally, in these ether elec- trolytes, shorter Li+−N(FSI– ) interaction distances are also ob- served at r ≈2.20 Å and r ≈4 Å, where two consecutive RDF peaks are identified around 4 Å (Fig. 4c). These reduced interac- tion distances of Li+−Li+ and Li+−N(FSI– ) indicate the presence of large ion aggregates (AGGs) composed of multiple Li+ and FSI– ions45,91. Across all the salt concentrations (1M, 1.8M, and 4M) in DPE and FEME ether electrolytes, the Li+ and FSI– ions formed large ion aggregates, where the FSI– anions coordinating with multiple Li+ cations via their O atoms (Fig. S1 and S1†). This aggregation behavior is further supported by the long-range Li+−O(FSI– ) interactions within the secondary solvation shell, observed at r ≈4.38 Å in DPE and 4.36 Å in FEME electrolytes (Fig. 3c). In contrast, the EC/DEC carbonate electrolyte exhibits a homogeneous distribution of Li+, PF – 6 , and EC/DEC solvent molecules (Fig. S1). The Li+ cations in the carbonate electrolyte are more widely separated as they are strongly coordinated by sol- vent molecules, which leads to the formation of solvent separated ion pairs (SSIPs)26,41,46,92–95.

Our findings reveal that DPE and FEME electrolytes are primarily composed of AGGs, while SSIPs are more prevalent in the EC/DEC electrolyte. Inside the first solvation shell, the higher RDF peaks and CN values of Li+−N(FSI– ) in FEME electrolytes also highlight that Li+−FSI– pairs exhibit stronger aggregation in FEME electrolytes than in DPE electrolytes across all the salt concentrations (Fig. S1, 4c, 4d, S1†, and Table 3). This is further supported by the higher coordination numbers of Li+−Li+ and Li+−O(FSI– ) interactions in the primary solvation shell of FEME electrolytes compared to all other electrolytes (Table 3).

These solvation structures signifi- cantly influence ion transport, stability, and chemical reactivity in electrolytes, which are critical for the design of lithium-ion bat- teries. The solvation structures in DPE- and FEME-based elec- trolytes are categorized into three groups: AGG-1 (containing one or two FSI– anions), AGG-2 (three or four FSI– anions), and AGG-3 (five or six FSI– anions). In the mixed EC/DEC electrolyte, the solvation structures are classified as solvent sep- arated ion pairs (SSIPs), contact ion pairs (CIPs), and aggre- gates (AGGs). The solvation structures in DPE+1.8M LiFSI, FEME+1.8M LiFSI, and EC/DEC+1M LiPF6 electrolytes are il- lustrated in Fig. S15† to S19†. The frequency of occurrence of all possible unique solvation structures in each electrolyte is analyzed in Fig. 6 and 7. Fig. 7b also shows the percent- 1–31 | 7", "page": 6, "position": 2}

In DPE+LiFSI, as the salt concentration rises from 1M to 1.8M to 4M, the unique solvation structures increase from 7 to 8 to 10 (Fig. 6a, 6b, and 6c). Similarly, in FEME+LiFSI, increas- ing the concentration from 1M to 1.8M to 4M results in a rise in unique solvation structures from 9 to 10 to 12 (Fig. 6d, 6e, and 6f). However, each FEME+LiFSI electrolyte exhibits a slightly higher number of possible solvation structures than DPE+LiFSI electrolytes. A detailed speciation of AGG in each DPE- and FEME-based electrolyte is shown in Fig. 8. At all salt concentra- tions, in DPE+LiFSI and FEME+LiFSI electrolytes, the primary aggregates belong to category AGG-2, containing three or four FSI– anions and one solvent molecule (Fig. 8 and 9). Our results show that in each DPE- and FEME-based electrolyte, the solva- tion structures are primarily AGG (Fig. 6), whereas in the mixed EC/DEC electrolyte, 68% are SSIP and only 5.33% are AGG (Fig. 7b).

The binding energies of these AGGs in the 1.8M DPE and 1.8M FEME electrolytes are quite similar, ranging from -8.91 to -7.29 eV and -8.64 to -7.36 eV, respectively ( Tables 7 and 8). For the SSIPs (including PF – 6 ), CIPs, and AGGs, the binding energy ranges from -11.55 to -9.48 eV, while for SSIPs (excluding PF – 6 ), the binding energy is lower, ranging from -3.46 to -2.39 eV (Tables 9 and 10). Binding energy is the energy required to break a system into its individual components and separate them infinitely. In the context of lithium-ion solvation structures, binding energy refers to the strength of interaction between the Li+ ion and the sol- vent or anions species in the cation solvation shell.

The HOMO and LUMO distributions of all the lithium-ion solva- tion structures were simulated to investigate their reductive sta- bility and to understand their decomposition mechanisms (Fig. 10). The LUMO energy level often serves as a key indica- tor of the reductive stability of electrolyte solutions. Addition- ally, the molecular orbital diagram of the LUMO can help deter- mine potential decomposition pathways of these solvation struc- tures, as the LUMO is the orbital where electron acceptance oc- curs during reduction80. Furthermore, the energy band gap (LUMO−HOMO) can also determine the chemical reactivity and stability of these solvation structures. A smaller band gap typi- cally corresponds to higher chemical reactivity and lower stabil- ity, while a larger band gap suggests reduced reactivity and in- creased stability73. Among these solvation structures, the SSIPs without the PF – 6 anion have a lower band gap (0.18 to 0.30 eV) and binding energy (-3.50 to -2.40 eV), making them the most unstable structures (Table 10). The LUMO is primarily distributed on the FSI– anion in all LiFSI-containing solvation structures in both 1.8M DPE and 1.8M FEME electrolytes (Fig. 10, S20†, and S21†). Hence, the FSI– anions will preferentially undergo reductive decomposition80. In the SSIP, CIP, and AGG structures in EC/DEC+1M LiPF6 electrolyte, the LUMO is distributed across both EC and DEC molecules. These findings indicate that reductive decomposition reactions may occur through both EC and DEC decomposition80. Conclusions In the present study, we systematically investigate the elec- trolyte structures in fluorinated ether (FEME+LiFSI), non- fluorinated ether (DPE+LiFSI), and organic carbonate-based (EC/DEC+LiPF6) electrolytes over a wide range of salt concentra- tion (1M, 1.8M, and 4M) using a combination of classical MD sim- ulations with the OPLS-AA force field and DFT calculations. We observe that AGGs are the predominant species in the ether-based electrolytes, whereas SSIPs dominate in the mixed carbonate- based electrolyte. This aggregation effect is particularly strong in FEME-based electrolytes, supported by the high coordination number of Li+−Li+ pairs and the comparatively lower binding energy of FEME to Li+.

This aggregation effect is particularly strong in FEME-based electrolytes, supported by the high coordination number of Li+−Li+ pairs and the comparatively lower binding energy of FEME to Li+. The most dominant solvation structure in each ether-based electrolyte is the anion-rich solvation structure Li+(FSI– )3(DPE)1 and Li+(FSI– )3(FEME)1, respectively, and re- mains nearly unchanged at varying salt concentrations. Regard- ing the solvent composition in the solvation structures of the EC/DEC electrolyte, a higher fraction of DEC appears to be fa- vorable. Our findings indicate that both DPE and FEME solvents exhibit weak solvating power at all salt concentrations, as indi- cated by the radial distribution functions, coordination numbers, and solvation structures, which show a strong preference for Li+ to interact with FSI– anions in the primary solvation shell. In particular, FEME shows even weaker solvating power than DPE, as indicated by the higher coordination numbers of FSI– in the primary solvation shell of FEME electrolytes. We also observe an increase in unique solvation structures in ether-based elec- trolytes with higher salt concentrations, with FEME+LiFSI dis- playing a slightly larger variety of structures than DPE+LiFSI. Furthermore, the electronic information of the lithium-ion sol- vation structures obtained from the DFT calculations are quite similar for both DPE- and FEME-based electrolytes. The charge density difference and Bader charge analysis show that the charge transfer from Li+ to the surrounding solvents and anions in the AGGs of the DPE+1.8M LiFSI electrolyte (0.70 - 0.86 e) is com- paratively higher than in the FEME+1.8M LiFSI electrolyte (0.67 - 0.79 e). The binding energies of these AGGs in the 1.8M DPE and 1.8M FEME electrolytes are quite similar, ranging from -8.91 to -7.29 eV and -8.64 to -7.36 eV, respectively. The chemical sta- bility of the solvation structures has also been predicted using their HOMO/LUMO distributions.
