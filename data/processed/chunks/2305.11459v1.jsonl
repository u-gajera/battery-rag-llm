Wabeto, K.N. Nigussa∗, L.D. Deja Department of Physics, Addis Ababa University, P.O. Box 1176, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia Abstract In this study, we have employed a DFT+U calculation using quantum-espresso (QE) code to investigate the structural, electronic, optical, and magnetic properties of LiFePO4 cathode material for Li-ion batteries. Crystals of LiFePO4 and related materials have recently received a lot of attention due to their very promising use as cathodes in rechargeable lithium-ion batteries. The structural optimization was performed and the equilibrium parameters such as the lattice constants, and the bulk modulus are calculated using QE code and found to be a=4.76 Å, b=6.00 Å, c=10.28 Å, β = 90.2 GPa, respectively. The projected density of states (PDOS) for the LiFePO4 material is remarkably similar to experimental results in literature showing the transition metal 3d states forming narrow bands above the O 2p band. The results of the various spin conﬁgurations suggested that the ferromagnetic conﬁguration can serve as a useful approximation for studying the general features of these systems. In the absence of Li, the majority spin transition metal 3d states are well-hybridized with the O 2p band in FePO4. The result obtained with a DFT + U showed that LiFePO4 is direct band gap materials with a band gap of 3.82 eV, which is within the range of the experimental values. The PDOS analyses show qualitative information about the crystal ﬁeld splitting and bond hybridization and help rationalize the understanding of the structural, electronic, optical, and magnetic properties of the LiFePO4 as a novel cathode material. On the basis of the predicted optical absorbance, reﬂection, refractive index, and energy loss function, LiFePO4 is demonstrated to be viable and cost-eﬀective, which is very suitable as a cathode material for Li-ion battery.

As the world population grows, so too does the demand for energy and energy storage materials. The development of the next generation of cars, personal electronics, and renewable energy sources hinges on improvements in battery technology. Batteries are one of the most promising energy storage technologies due to their high conversion eﬃciency and essentially zero emissions [1]. Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) are considered to be one of the most promising batteries owing to their high power density, long cycle life, and environmental friendliness, which leads to their wide use in portable electronic devices [2]. The cathode ma- terial is the most crucial component of LIBs. Therefore, tremendous eﬀorts have been dedicated to the development of cathode materials. The cathode materials of LIBs are usually intercalation compounds, including layered LiMO2, (M=Co, Ni, Mn), LiNi1−xCoxMny, spinel LiMn2O4 and olivine LiFePO4 materials. Among them, olivine-structured LFP was proposed in 1997 by Pandhi [3] with excellent cycling stability, low cost, and good safety. Nevertheless, the poor ionic and electronic conductivity and low Li+ diﬀusion has hindered its further application. Morphology control, particle size reduction, surface coatings, and cation or anion doping have been applied to improve its properties [4]. Furthermore, it is signiﬁcant to explicitly understand the microscopic origins of these improvements. ∗Corresponding author: kenate.nemera@aau.edu.et (K.N.

Lithium iron phosphate, which is an ordered type compound, is under extensive studies as one of the most promis- ing cathode material. It has more favored properties such as low cost, environmental compatibility, less toxicity, high thermal stability, and high speciﬁc capacity compared to the LiCo2 and LiMn2O4. Most exciting advantages of LiFePO4 is its stability with high voltage application, hardly changes while Li-ion intercalation and deintercalation. In Li-ion battery, lithium ions are extracted from anode to cathode during discharge process and it is reversed during charging as depicted in Fig 1. The extraction and insertion of lithium during charging and recharging process may be written as Eqs. (1) & (2) below. However, the poor intrinsic electronic and ionic conductivities of LiFePO4 limits its practical use. Moreover, the band-gap of LiFePO4 is under debate which requires more structural and electronic analysis [5, 6]. LiFePO4 −xLi+ −xe−→FePO4 + (1 −x)LiFePO4 (1) FePO4 −xLi+ −xe−→LiFePO4 + (1 −x)LiFePO4 (2) Even though the low cost, good stability, and competitive electrochemical properties make the olivine LixMPO4 family an exciting new area for cathode development in Li rechargeable batteries, they are facing challenges due to their low electrical conductivity. Among these olivine cathode materials, LiFePO4, which is in its pure form has very poor conductivity, greatly inhibited high-rate applications. Eﬀorts to increase conductivity of electrodes made from the materials have focused on particle size reduction, intimate carbon coating, and cation doping. Signiﬁcant disagree- ment exits on the origin of the low electronic conductivity [7]. Ab-initio studies focusing on the band gap and eﬀective hole or electron mass have found a small gap, or no gap at the Femi level, which seems to be in contradiction to experiment. However, there is signiﬁcant evidence that the local density approximation (LDA) and generalized gradient approximation (GGA) used in almost all previous stud- ies on the electronic structure of these phosphates cannot accurately reproduce their electronic structure due to the approximate treatment of the electron correlation in transition metal orbitals by LDA/GGA.

In order to clarify the electronic structure of LiFePO4 we have applied the more accurate DFT+U (LDA+U/GGA+U) method to determine the projected density of states (PDOS) of these materials [8]. Concerns with the safety, cost, charge/discharge rates, cycle life, and energy density of Li-ion batteries represent the main challenges in Li-ion development. Additionally, if Li-ion batteries are to be employed in Hybrid Electrical Vehicles (HEVs) then gravimetric energy density, uniformity in performance of individual cells inside a complex, multicell battery, and cost are the ﬁelds where more research is absolutely necessary [9]. Thus, current rapid develop- ment of society requires a major advancement in the battery materials to achieve high accuracy, long life cycle, low cost, and reliable safety. Therefore, many new eﬃcient energy storage materials and battery systems are being de- veloped and explored, and their working mechanisms must be clearly understood before industrial applications [10]. Nowadays, computers are very useful tools for condensed matter physics and material sciences and they have been used to predict the electronic, optical, and magnetic properties of materials by using a suitable computing method [11]. By now, a lot of ﬁrst principle calculations have been performed on LiFePO4 cathode materials and FePO4 [12] to analyze electronic, optical, and magnetic properties of LiFePO4. The focus of this study was the electronic structure 2", "page": 1, "position": 1}

From many aspects, iron is an attractive metal for use in the ﬁeld of battery materials since it is abundant and environmentally friendly [13]. Crystals of LiFePO4 and related materials have recently received a lot of attention due to their very promising use as cathodes in rechargeable lithium ion bat- teries [14]. The paper is organized as follows. In the next section (sec. 2), a detail account of the computational method is presented. Results and discussion are presented in section 3, with the conclusion being presented in section 4. 2. Computational Methods An ab-initio simulations within quantum espresso code [15] is used to examine the electronic structure and optical properties of LiFePO4. The electron wave-function is expanded over a plane wave basis set. The electron-ion inter- actions is approximated within projector augmented wave (PAW) modality [16] upon the calculation of electronic properties and geometry optimization. Upon optical properties calculations, the electron-ion interactions is approxi- mated within norm conserving pseudopotential [17]. The exchange-correlation energies are treated using PBE [18]. The k-points of the Brillouin zone (BZ) are generated from the input k-mesh using the Monkhorst-Pack scheme [19]. The number of valence electrons considered for each element within the paw data sets is Li:1, Fe:8, P:5, and O:6. Geometry relaxations are carried out using BFGS minimizer [20], where optimization of the atomic coordinates and the unit cell degrees of freedom is done within the concept of the Hellmann-Feynman forces and stresses [21, 22] as calculated on the Born-Oppenheimer (BO) surface [23]. The convergence criteria for the forces were set at 0.05 eV/Å. A van der Waal’s treatment within DFT-D3 [24] is applied wherever necessary. The k-mesh of 4×4×4 and a cut-oﬀ energy (ecut) of 600 eV is used in the calculations. Hubbard U correction [25] is applied to the dopant atoms. We have selected U=4.5 eV to be optimum to our system.

Projected DOS (PDOS) is calculated as a component of DOS resolved onto atomic orbitals. To characterize optical properties, a dielectric function is computed, which has generally a complex nature & is given as ε(ω) = ε1(ω) + i ε2(ω) (3) The imaginary part ε2(ω) is calculated from the density matrix of the electronic structure [26] as described else- where [27], & given by ε2(ω) = 8π2e2ℏ2 Ωω2me2 X k,v,c wk|⟨ψc k|u·r|ψv k⟩|2δ(Ec k −Ev k −ℏω), (4) where e is the electronic charge, and ψc k and ψv k are the conduction band (CB) and valence band (VB) wave functions at k, respectively, ℏω is the energy of the incident phonon, u·r is the momentum operator, wk is a joint density of states, & Ωis volume of the primitive cell.

After getting the kinetic energy cut-oﬀand the number of special k-points which give the best convergence possible of total energy, we calculated the total energy for various values of the lattice constants. Energies were calculated for various values of lattice constant, and a curve ﬁtting to the values of total energy as a function of the unit cell volume is done according to Murnaghan equation [33]. From the output of the curve ﬁt, the values of bulk modulus, and lattice constant are predicted. 3. Results and Discussion 3.1. Structural and electronic properties From our DFT calculations, we found the values of the lattice parameters for LiFePO4 orthorhombic structure to be a = 4.67 Å. This result is in good agreement with experimental results in the literature, summarized in Table 1 below.

The band structure for ferromagnetic forms of FePO4 and LiFePO4 are shown in Fig. 3. A direct band gap seems 0.10 eV with DFT (GGA), and 3.82 eV using DFT + U formalism for LiFePO4. Experimental band gap results for LiFePO4 are 2.86-4.00 eV, as reported in a literature [35]. Thus, while the GGA (PBE) functional predicts a metallic behavior with the Fermi level of the system crossing the minority-spin d states, DFT + U is eﬀective in predicting a correct band gap. In the total and projected DOS analysis illustrated in Figs. 4 & 5, the main contribution to valence band was associated with O 2p states with minor contributions from Fe-3d states. At the conduction band, the dominant contribution is by Fe-3d atomic orbitals with a small content oxygen atomic orbitals. Thus, it is possible to assume that an electron transfer inside the band gap region should occur between 2p orbitals of oxygen atom and 3d orbitals of the Fe in tetrahedral conﬁgurations, represented by FePO6 clusters. In order to know the distribution of the total charge density of LiFePO4 orthorhombic structure, we have calculated the charge density distribution. From the result we can observe that LiFePO4 structure makes a covalent bonding. From Fig. 6, it is clear that in LiFePO4 structure Fe-Fe shows a very weak charge density but when we move to P-P bonding, there is stronger charge density. Also as clear as it is from the scale, purple color shows the greater charge density than the remaining atoms. 5", "page": 4, "position": 0}

The homogeneous distribution of contour lines represents the strongly covalent character in the interaction of the Li and Fe cations atoms with oxygen anion on the [001] analyzed plane. The observed behavior occurs because of the hybridization between the O 2p atomic orbitals with Fe 3d atomic orbitals. For FePO4, the Fe states are well hybridized with O 2p states throughout the valence band. This is shown both in the projected densities of states plot of Fig. 5 and in the contour plot of Fig. 6. 3.2.

Each peak in the imaginary part of the dielectric function corresponds to an electronic transition. The imaginary part of the complex dielectric function is related to a measure of optical absorption. The real part of dielectric function is obtained using Eq. (5) and describes other properties such as optical transmission. Figure 7 depicts a graph of dielectric function against the photon energy which gives the calculated results of the real (ε1) and imaginary (ε2) parts of the dielectric functions which are connected by the dispersion relations [40]. The static value of ε1(0) is 64.07, and it reaches a maximum value of 130.27 at photon energy of 0.8 eV. With increasing photon energy, it gradually decreases to a minimum value of -58.98 at photon energy of around 1.12 eV, before it starts to slightly increase again. The distinctive features (peaks) of ε2 are due to optical transitions involving hybrid O-2p and Fe 3d orbital, as is the case in LiFePO4 (LFP) [41]. Interestingly in LFP, the band transitions seem to happen without excitonic eﬀects. The absorption coeﬃcient determines which light of a particular wavelength is absorbed by a material [42]. In a material with a low absorption coeﬃcient, light is only poorly absorbed, and if the material is thin enough, it will appear transparent to that wavelength. The absorption coeﬃcient depends on the material and also on the wavelength of light which is being absorbed. The absorption coeﬃcient of LiFePO4 is given in Fig. 8. At 2.5 eV, an absorption peak in the xx-direction is noticed. At 5.8 eV, an absorption peak in the zz-direction is noticed. At 12.5 eV, an absorption peak in the yy-direction is noticed. The refractive index computed using Eq. (7) is shown in Fig. 8. The maximum refractive index value of 14.1 oc- curs at photon energy of 0.5 eV.

Between photon energies of 0 and 2.0 eV, the index of refraction attains maximum and then gradually decreases to n(ω) = 1. Reﬂectance is ability of a substance to reﬂect radiation. As shown in Fig. 8, the reﬂectivity at zero photon energy has values of 0.61 in the xx-direction, 0.59 in the yy-direction, and 0.72 in the zz-direction. At photon energy of 1.84 eV, the highest reﬂectivity peak of 0.75 is noticed in the xx-direction. At photon energy of 1.70 eV, a highest reﬂectivity peaks of 0.78 in the zz-direction and 0.68 in the yy-direction is noticed. The electron energy loss spectrum (eels) displays a prospect of a material resulting in some of the electrons un- dergoing inelastic scattering, which means that they lose energy and have their paths slightly and randomly deﬂected. The eels for the LFP system is shown in Fig. 9. At 13.5 eV, we have the highest energy loss in the xx-direction. The Joint density of states (JDOS) is an indicator of the number of available states for photons to interact with. For optical absorption process, it is an important part of optical characteristics of a given material. The JDOS of LFP shows the sharpest peak at 6.0 eV (Fig. 10). 9", "page": 8, "position": 1}

Conclusion In this study, we have employed a DFT + U calculations to investigate the structural, electronic, optical, and mag- netic properties of LiFePO4 cathode material for Li-ion batteries. We have performed the structural optimization and calculated the equilibrium parameters such as the lattice constants, and the bulk modulus using QE code and found that a = 4.76 Å, b = 6.00 Å, c = 10.28 Å, and β = 90.2 GPa. The results obtained are in agreement with experimental results reported in the literature. The result obtained with a DFT + U showed that LiFePO4 is direct band gap materials with a band gap of 3.82 eV, which is within a range of the experimental values. We have analyzed the projected density of states which suggest that the majority spin states of FePO4 have substantial covalent character due to the energetic overlap of the O states with the Fe states. In LiFePO4, there is less covalent character such that the Fe states form narrow bands above the O bands with a relatively lower extent of mixing. Thus, based on the results, it seems that LiFePO4 is more stable than FePO4. On the basis of the predicted optical absorbance, reﬂection, refractive index, and energy loss function, LiFePO4 seems to be viable and cost-eﬀective as a cathode material for Li-ion battery. Furthermore, it appears that the DFT + U formalism is the most suitable choice to investigate the strongly correlated LiFePO4 system, contributing to further literature resource involving such technological material.
