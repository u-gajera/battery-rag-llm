In 2008 we introduced a zirconia stabilized VB2 air battery. This 11e- (eleven electron) per molecule, room temperature, aqueous electrolyte battery has the highest volumetric energy capacity for a battery, with an intrinsic capacity greater than that of gasoline and an order of magnitude higher than that of conventional lithium ion batteries (1-3). The challenge has been to recharge the battery; that is to electrochemically reinsert 11e- into the battery discharge products. Here, this challenge is resolved through the introduction of a new class of molten air batteries. Other classes of molten electrolyte batteries had been investigated. A molten sulfur battery has been widely studied, particularly for electric car and grid applications (4, 5). During discharge, the battery uses sulfur and sodium (or potassium) for the respective cathode and anode storage materials, and these high temperature molten components are kept from chemically", "page": 0, "position": 1}

Both the molten and room temperature class of sulfur cathode batteries (6), are limited by the maximum intrinsic capacity of the 2e- per sulfur (2 Faraday/ 32g sulfur). Another class of molten metal electrolyte batteries utilizes an insoluble, dense, molten cathode during discharge situated below a (less dense) molten metal anode floating on a molten electrolyte. Unlike the molten sulfur battery, this latter class does not require a solid electrolyte separator; but to date has lower capacity. An example of this latter class of batteries is the magnesium-antimony battery with a molten halide electrolyte (7). In this study, rechargeable molten air batteries are introduced, and several battery chemistry examples are demonstrated. The rechargeable molten cathode instead uses oxygen directly from the air, not stored, to yield high battery capacity. The cathode is compatible with multiple electron anodes made possible by our advances in molten salt chemistry. Three examples of the new batteries are demonstrated. These are the iron, carbon and VB2 molten air batteries with respective intrinsic volumetric energy capacities of 10,000, 19,000 and 27,000 Wh liter-1. These capacities compare favorably to the intrinsic capacity of the well known lithium air battery (6,200 Wh liter-1) due to the latter’s single electron transfer and low density limits. As illustrated in Fig. 1 for the iron molten air example of the battery, during charging, iron oxide is converted to iron metal, and O2 is released to the air. During discharge iron metal is converted back to iron oxide. The electrolyte, Li2CO3, which melts at 723°C is an effective electrolyte. Fig. 1. The molten iron air battery.

As evident in the left side of Fig. 2, a steel foil cathode (and a oxygen evolving nickel foil anode) is effective iron for iron oxide splitting, and we have previously shown the wide temperature, concentration and carbonate composition domain in which nickel and iridium are effective air (anode) electrodes and steel, iron and platinum are effective iron (cathode) electrodes for this charging process. These anodes and cathodes can sustain high (mA to A per cm-2) current densities at low overpotential in molten lithium carbonate for the oxidation of oxides to oxygen (for either iron oxide (8-10) or carbon dioxide splitting (12,13)). The same electrolysis shown in the lower portion of Fig. 2 can also represent charging of an iron molten air battery at high current density and low potential. Interestingly, as seen in the right side of Fig. 2, the reverse case, the reduction of oxygen to oxides, is also effective. Ni – air, and steel – iron, electrodes are used, but iridium as the air, and platinum as the iron electrode are also effective and exhibit similar polarization currents. As expected, the oxygen reduction electrode is rate limiting. That is, the oxygen reduction reaction incurs with a several fold higher overpotential (lower current density at equivalent electrolysis potentials) than the cathode iron oxidation discharge reaction. In the absence of oxygen (under nitrogen in the figure), it is seen that the current density diminishes to insignificance, while pure O2, rather than air, increases the current density establishing the basis for electrochemical discharge of the cell.

Here, we consider this unusual electrolytic splitting as a battery “charging”. We couple this with the known primary discharge of the air cathode as used in the widely studied molten carbonate fuel cell, including those using coal as a fuel (19,20), to explore the first example of a molten air rechargeable battery. In lieu of iron, we also explore the alternative use of carbon and VB2 as high capacity discharge anodes for these rechargeable cells. Electrochemical storage in these iron, carbon or VB2 molten air batteries is in accord with: Iron molten air battery, 3e- discharge/charge: Fe + 3/4O2 ⇌ 1/2Fe2O3 (1) Carbon molten air battery, 4e- discharge/charge: C + O2 ⇌ CO2 (2) VB2 molten air battery, 11e- discharge/charge: VB2 + 11/4O2 ⇌ B2O3 + V2O5 (3) The right column of Table 1 compares the intrinsic capacity of these batteries, which is one to two orders of magnitude greater than that of the volumetric energy capacity of conventional Li ion batteries. Lithium (metal) air also has a lower volumetric energy capacity (6,200 Wh liter-1). Note, that while Li’s gravimetric charge capacity (3860 Ah/kg) is similar to that of VB2, it has lower volumetric capacity due to a low density (0.534 kg liter-1), and single, rather then multiple, electron charge transfer.

For example, while constant over a wide temperature range at 1.0 V for the carbon anode, E° decreases for the iron anode from 1.2 to 0.9 V with temperature increase from 25°C to 850°C (12). The volumetric energy capacity, Evol, is calculated from the number of electrons stored, n, the density d, the Faraday constant, F = 26.80 Ah mol-1, the formula weight, FW, and E° in accord Eqs. 1, 2 or 3 as Evol = ndE°F / FW.

Platinum was used (figure bottom), rather than steel foil (figure middle), steel screen or coiled iron wire (which are each effective as current collectors), to establish in this experiment that iron from Fe2O3, rather iron from the current collector, is deposited during charge and oxidized during discharge. We have previously quantified that nickel is highly stable as an air anode in a variety of lithium oxide electrolytes and less so in sodium/potassium carbonate electrolytes. Iridium was used (figure bottom) here, rather than nickel (figure middle), to establish that both are effective as the air electrode for both charge and discharge.

We have recently shown that under many conditions, molten lithium carbonate readily absorbs atmospheric carbon dioxide, providing a facile route to decrease CO2 in the atmosphere. As summarized in the CO2/carbonate equilibrium diagram in Fig. 4, we now calculate from the known variation of standard enthalpies and entropies with temperature (21-23) that barium carbonate has an even larger affinity for CO2 capture than lithium carbonate. The portion above, or below, the equilibrium curves in the figure summarize the partial pressure of CO2 and dissolved oxide concentration relative to carbonate in which CO2 absorption occurs (above the line) or carbonate decomposition occurs (below the line). This equilibrium can be controlled through cation and temperature choice, and the concentration of oxide in the melt. Molten carbonate can gain or lose mass through CO2 absorption or emission, and the concentration of carbon dioxide maintained above the melt is in accord with the equilibrium: MCO3 ⇌ MO + CO2; M= Li2, Na2, K2, Ba, etc (4) Fig. 4.

As we have previously observed with electrolyses of lithium carbonate electrolytes (13), and as seen in the photo inset of Fig. 5, electrolysis of the barium/lithium carbonate mix at 750° forms a voluptuous layer of carbon on the (steel) cathode side facing the air electrode.

Carbon formation, as noted above during molten carbonate electrolyses, here represents charging of the carbon/molten air battery.

While there are few studies regarding charging of carbonates, there is a wide body of knowledge regarding the electrochemistry of discharge in molten carbonates (the molten carbonate fuel cell literature). In comparison, the electrochemical foundation of understanding of the VB2 molten air system is even smaller, and there is little in the way of prior studies regarding the electrochemistry of the Eq. 3 discharge products - molten vanadates or molten borates. Here, we provide a path towards recharge of the VB2 molten air battery. The studies are less advanced due to the scarcity of prior fundamental electrochemical knowledge of the system. The VB2 discharge products B2O3 (mp 450 °C, white, melts clear) and V2O5 (mp 690 °C, yellow/brown) have a low melting point compared to VB2 (mp 2450 °C, black). The molten B2O3 and V2O5 salts are miscible, whereas VB2 does not appear to be miscible , and due to is higher density VB2 descends in the molten mixture. However, this molten phase is an insulator, without significant ionic dissociation. The melt cannot be electrochemically charged. Dissolution of an oxide, such as Li2O or, in the melt provides adequate ionic conductivity, and charging of the molten electrolyte occurs. The high temperature (molten) phase of the Li2O-B2O3-V2O5 system has not been previously explored, but ionic conductivity range of this system in the solid phase has been established at temperatures up to 250°C (25). The higher temperature binary system B2O3 (mp 450 °C) and Li2O (mp 1438 °C, white, dissolves clear) presents a complex phase diagram with an extensive homogenous liquid phase above 767 °C (26). Domains of this diagram that we have probed are indicated by colored lines in the top of Fig. 6. For this study we have explored both single cell and separated half cell (air electrode in a crucible with a porous bottom sitting in the electrolyte of a larger crucible with the VB2 electrode) configurations, and have found no advantage of the more complex separated cell configuration.

The alumina (Al2O3) crucible is susceptible to corrosion in the high Li2O concentration electrolytes (to LiAlO3) particularly at temperatures above 800°C. Lithiated alumina ceramic crucibles would be preferred, but are unavailable. Charging of the electrolyte of the B2O3, V2O5, Li2O mix electrolyte is accomplished at a coiled nickel wire anode above a coiled steel wire cathode in an alumina crucible, and yields a thick black deposit on the cathode. A 2A charge for 6 hours results in a mass loss of 1.5 g, only ~40% of the expected mass loss due to oxygen evolution via equation 3. Alternative means to improve this low charging coulombic efficiency will be explored in future experiments. We hypothesize that this low charging efficiency is due to reoxidation of the product by oxygen dissolved within the electrolyte (hence, the brief foray into the separated half cell configuration). Alternatively, equivalent mixtures of LiVO3 and LiBO2 yield similar results. Following extraction, cooling, and acid wash to remove soluble components, FTIR of the product exhibits absorption peaks at 1640 and 3470 cm-1 that overlap with that of commercial (NOAH high purity chemicals) VB2.

Materials and Methods (at end) Figures S1-S24, Tables S1-S21, References R1-R4 Supplementary Materials: We had recently discovered that the lithiation of iron oxides facilitates their concentrated dissolution in molten carbonates. Both hematite, Fe2O3, and magnetite, Fe3O4, are highly soluble in molten lithiated carbonates (8-11). We have observed a high solubility for both lower temperature eutectic carbonate melts (Li0.87Na0.63K0.50CO3), and for pure Li2CO3, (pure Li2CO3 melts at 723°C). In Li2CO3, ferric, [Fe(III)], solubility increases from 7 to 12 molal (molal = m ≡ moles per / kg Li2CO3) with temperature increase from 750 to 900°C, while in the eutectic the solubility increases from 1 to 4 m Fe(III) as temperature increases from 550°C to 900°C. Lithium oxide is not consumed in the iron making process. For Fe2O3 in molten carbonate, the STEP iron production mechanism is given by (9): I dissolution in molten carbonate Fe2O3 + Li2O → 2LiFeO2 (S-1) II electrolysis, Li2O regeneration: 2LiFeO2 → 2Fe+ Li2O + 3/2O2 (S-2) III net reaction: 2 Fe2O3 → 2Fe+ 3/2O2 (S-3) Speciation profile of iron deposited during charge. Fig. S-1 profiles the measured concentrations of the reduced iron species subsequent to electrolysis. The width reflects the relative total fraction of iron metal found in each layer.

One objective of this supplemental study is the systematic optimization of the STEP Iron to approach 100% coulombic efficiency of the conversion of ferric ion, Fe3+, to iron metal, Fe°, and a second objective to accomplish that high coulombic efficiency at low energy (low applied electrolysis potential and high current density). The electrolysis of Fig. 2 (main paper), is conducted with parallel, horizontal anode and cathode. The nickel oxygen evolving anode is situated near the surface of electrolyte, 1 cm above the cathode. The 10 cm2 nickel electrode is oversized compared to the 6.2 cm2 cathode. The electrolyte composition and temperature, and the electrolysis configuration, duration and current density have a substantial impact on STEP Iron coulombic efficiency. For example, the electrolysis of Fig. 2 is conducted at 730°C, near the electrolyte melting point, and a rise in temperature to 850°C decreases the requisite electrolysis potential but generates a lower fraction of iron metal. This supplementary material in the next section begins with an electrolysis temperature of 800°C, and systematically conducts modification of the physical chemical components of the system to understand conditions which increase coulombic efficiency and minimize the requisite electrolysis potential.

The coulombic efficiency compares the applied electrolysis current to the theoretical required for the three electron reduction of Fe3+ to iron metal. Efficiency is highest at minimum molten lithium carbonate temperature, intermediate dissolved ferric concentration (3 molal), intermediate cathode and anode current density, anode electron transfer facilitated by situating the anode near the electrolyte//air interface, and or a vertical cathode parallel to a vertical anode. Extended duration electrolyses can be sustained if levels of ferric are not depleted, such as would be achieved via continuous addition of ferric oxide during the electrolysis. The electrolysis configuration is simplified when the electrolysis is conducted in a nickel crucible, which comprises both the anode and the cell body in one piece. The overpotential is constrained by the anode current density; energy minimization is achieved with a maximum anode surface area. Interelectrode separations must be small enough (< 1 cm) to minimize potential loss at high (> 0.1 A cm-2) current density. Consistent with the expected Nernst decrease of redox potential with increasing ferric concentration, higher LiFeO2 (and LiO2) concentration decreases the electrolysis potential As delineated in the next section, optimized electrolyses occur in a low electrolysis potential of 1.35 V and at coulombic efficiency approaching 100%. The energy required to generate a mole of iron is 1.35V x (3 Faraday / mole Fe) x (26.8 Ah per Faraday) = 109 Wh per mole of iron.

The carbon footprint of molten carbonate electrolytes with less soluble or insoluble is explored here as green, low cost alternatives to a pure lithium carbonate electrolyte. Iron oxide solubility in a molten carbonate electrolyte decreases when there is less lithium present; the solubility of Fe3+ in a Li0.87Na0.63K0.5CO3 eutectic is less than half of its value in Li2CO3 (8).1 Electrolysis of Fe3+ dissolved in this eutectic diminishes the secondary Fe2+ layer in the product, compared to that in Li2CO3, as seen in Fig. S-7. Systematic Optimization of electrolytic iron production in molten carbonate. A systematic, variation of molten iron electrolysis can yield efficient iron production efficiency at low energy. General conditions of the first series of electrolyses are summarized in Table S-1. The cathode in this first series of experiments is a thin planar 6.25 cm2 steel sheet. This cathode lies under the anode, and we observe that the iron product is deposited on top of the cathode. This cathode surface is the active area exposed to short ion diffusion path between the electrodes.

In the first series of experiments, summarized in Table S-2, the anode to interelectrode spacing is varied, and the mass of electrolyte was changed to cover smaller or larger inter-electrode separations. The electrodes before and after electrolysis are photographed in Fig. S-2. The lithium based electrolyte is highly conductive, and even at these relatively high current densities, electrolytic resistance losses are not significantly impacted by the variation of inter-electrode spacing. The electrolysis potentials at 1 A constant current are the same to within 0.1 V, independent of the 0.25 to 2.0 cm electrode separation. Coulombic efficiency, particularly during the 0.25 cm separation electrolysis may have been impacted by shorting as the iron deposit growing from the cathode approached the anode, and that a maximum of over 50% coulombic efficiency is achieved for an intermediate spacing of 1.0 cm. Table S-3 summarizes STEP Iron electrolyses in which the starting concentration of Li2O is varied. In each case, the initial ferric concentration (as added Fe2O3) is kept constant at 3 molal Fe3+ in Li2CO3. As we have previously demonstrated, Fe2O3 is not soluble in carbonate unless Li2O is added, and reacts to form LiFeO2 in the molten solution (8-10). The Li2O is not consumed in the electrolysis process. That is consistent with eq. 7, as LiFeO2 is reduced to form iron metal, Li2O is liberated to dissolve the next iteration of added iron ore (Fe2O3).

This will be exacerbated by (ii) a lower solubility of iron oxide in the eutectic at lower temperature and with lower lithium ion content, and (iii) higher overpotential due to the higher electrolyte resistance of a mixed alkali, compared to pure lithium, electrolyte. The general conditions of electrolysis are similar to those in Table S-1. At the lower 500°C temperature, only a lower concentration of iron oxide could be dissolved in the eutectic and the sustainable current at a reasonable electrolysis potential was only, 0.4 A, rather than 1A. Hence, the electrolysis time was increased from 1 to 2.5 hours to provide a constant total current during the experiment. As summarized in Table S-5, even at the lower current, the lower temperature still requires a high (3.5V) average electrolysis potential, and results in a poor coulombic efficiency. As seen in Table S-5, by 750°C, the Li0.85Na0.61K0.54CO3 eutectic could readily accommodate the full 3 molal Fe3+ used in the pure lithium carbonate electrolyte at 800C. It is evident in the figure that in the eutectic at 750C, a higher electrolysis potentials was needed to accommodate the same 1 Amp current used in the pure lithium electrolyte.

Table S-11 further probes of silicate effect on STEP Iron. We had previously studied the dissolution of silica, SiO2, as Li4SiO4 in molten carbonates (10). Here, we see the trend that higher SiO2 ranging from 10 to 30% (added as a percentage of the iron oxide mass to simulate an impurity in the iron ore), tends to decrease the average electrolysis potential, but also decreases the coulombic efficiency of iron production.

Prior to this surface anode configuration, anodes occasionally spontaneously broke during the course of the electrolysis. However the surface anodes appear to be fully stable, that is, there is no case of anode discontinuity occurring with the surface anodes in the next 30 experiments, independent of electrolysis conditions, and the anode always appeared to be unaffected by the electrolysis (no corrosion was evident).

As seen in Table S-12, the electrolysis potential decreases with increasing anode surface area, and its overpotential decreases by 300 mV as the surface area is increase from 1.3 to 19 cm2. With the exception of the largest anode surface cell (which may be an outlier and exhibited an unstable electrolysis potential), the coulombic efficiency increases with increasing anode surface area, and the tightly coiled anode configuration leads to higher efficiency than the loosely coiled anode configuration.

Table S-13 presents the effect of the gas above the electrolysis on the iron production, when the gas is changed from either air, to carbon dioxide, or to nitrogen.

The first column contains the same anode on the surface separated by 1 cm from a cathode near the bottom of the cell. As seen in the second column, the use of a smaller (half) diameter nickel or iron wire for the anode and cathode decreases, rather than increases, the coulombic efficiency. We had been working under the hypothesis that hot oxygen would be deleterious to the metallic iron product. Hence, we had previously configured the anode above the cathode to allow gas to evolve without contacting the iron. Interestingly, in Table S-18, at the lower temperature of 730°C in molten lithium carbonate, an opposite, inverted electrode configurations is not only functional, but can exhibit both improved coulombic efficiency and lower electrolysis potential. The coulombic efficiency of these inverted cells is at least 94 to 95% (and this may be considered a lower limit if any iron metal drops into the electrolyte during the cathode removal). Photos of a vertical cathode inside the anode configuration are presented in Fig. S-14. The potential during electrolysis of these inverted electrode configurations is presented in Fig. S- 15.

A return to the horizontal, coiled anode (above the cathode and with an alumina separator) retains very high coulombic efficiencies but creates high electrolysis potential.

The coulombic efficiency approaches 100% yield of the 3 e- reduction of Fe2O3, The electrolysis potential is less than 1.4 V at a high (current density) rate of iron production. The iron electrolysis product contains iron and electrolyte, and is easy to remove, readily detaching from the cathode. A larger surface area cathode will lower this potential, but may lead to closer proximity to the anode which can decrease the iron coulombic efficiency. Opportunities to significantly decrease the electrolysis potential, while maintaining high cathode current densities, will likely be attained by moving from the largely planar oxygen electrode (anode) to chemically, or mechanically roughened, high microscopic surface area electrodes, and/or using geometric shapes which will expose more of anode surface than the planar electrode.

Electrolyses. Electrolysis conditions and the systematic variation of the electrolysis cell components are described in the Systematic Optimization of electrolytic iron production in molten carbonate section. The theoretical maximum mass of iron that can be produced from the ferric salt during the electrolysis is calculated as Electrolysis current (A) x Electrolysis time (s) x Atomic Weight Fe / (3 e- x 96,485 As). Analyses. Iron metal is produced by electrolysis in molten carbonate at the cathode. The cathode product is analyzed for iron metal content based on, and improved from the method of Xu and co-workers in which iron metal replaces cupper sulfate, and the product ferrous sulfate is analyzed.13 The procedure has been further improved by (i) washing the electrolysis product with deionized water, and (ii) replacement of the previous UV/Vis evaluation which was used at the", "page": 39, "position": 0}

The initial rinse removes Li2CO3 and Li2O to prevent reaction of Fe0 to form Fe(OH)2 or Fe(OH)3. In addition to the relative valence state composition of iron, the mass percent of total iron in the sample (including the solidified electrolyte) is shown in the Fetotal of column in Table S-1, and the last two columns are measured water soluble and water insoluble mass percent of each sample. The washed, dried insoluble component consists primarily of iron (iron metal and iron oxides). The iron analysis of weighed samples from each layer yields the concentrations: [Fetotal], [Fe°], [Fe2+], and [Fe3+] (the latter concentration is determined from the difference of [Fetotal]- [Fe°]- [Fe2+]). A separate, weighed sample from each layer is washed, followed by subtraction of the mass of the dried insoluble (filtered, dried) component. This yields the mass of the remaining soluble components. The water soluble salts components consist of Li2CO3 and Li2O. The Li2O dissolves as LiOH, including Li2O stripped from lithiated iron oxides when brought in contact with the wash water (e.g. LiFeO2 + H2O liberates soluble LiOH), and the 105°C dried components are weighed as the insoluble salts). The analysis procedure for iron metal is: 1) The cathode product is ground in a mortar and pestle, until it can be sifted and dispersed through a 70 mesh (212 µm) sieve. 2) The ground product is washed with deionized water, then extracted by suction filtration and rinsing the precipitate with deionized water until pH is near 7. The precipitates, residue and filter paper are collected to react with CuSO4. 3) To 0.5 g of the ground product is added 50 ml of 0.5 M CuSO4, to form: Fe + CuSO4 → FeSO4 + Cu (S-4) 4) After boiling this stirred solution for 1 hour, it is immediately filtered (to prevent the reaction of O2 with Fe2+) with a GF /A (Whatman glass microfiber) filter paper into a 250 ml volumetric flask, and the filter paper is washed with double deionized (18 MΩ)", "page": 40, "position": 0}

This titration analysis is also confirmed by weighing the mass of magnetically removed the iron product that was washed & dried to remove oxide. The reliability of the analysis during the titration is improved when solutions are stirred slowly in step 2, rather than rapidly, to prevent significant errors (underestimating the Fe° content of the product with increasing speed of stirring) due to the introduction of oxygen, which can convert ferrous to ferric prior to the titration. The need to switch to a lower stirring speed for the Fe° analysis was discovered and applied to the latter half of the experiments in this study. Under this latter condition replicate analyses of Fe° metal mass from are reproducible to within a +2%. The analysis procedure for total Fe is: In accord with the method of Shi et al (R-2), a 0.1g sample was placed in a 250 ml flask with the addition of 20 ml of 1:1 diluted HCl. The sample was placed on a mixer hot plate at about 90 oC (to prevent volatile loss of FeCl3 at higher temperature) until completely dissolved. 20 ml water was added under N2 (99.999%). Al powder was added in three 0.1 g portions (in large excess of the theoretical amount to reduce Fe3+ to Fe2+). With a minimum of stirring, the Al quickly reacts with Fe3+ and H+ to form Al3+, and Fe3+ was reduced to Fe2+. A color change from yellow to light yellow was observed until the solution was transparent.
