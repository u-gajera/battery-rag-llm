In this work we focus on two representatives of a well known family of cathode materials for Li-ion batteries, namely the orthorhombic LiMPO4 olivines (M = Fe, Mn). We show that extended Hubbard functionals with on-site (U) and inter-site (V ) interactions (so called DFT+U+V) can predict the electronic structure of the mixed-valence phases, the formation energy of the materials with intermediate Li contents, and the overall average voltage of the battery with remarkable accuracy. We ﬁnd, in particular, that the inclusion of inter-site interactions in the corrective Hamiltonian improves considerably the prediction of thermodynamic quantities when electronic localization occurs in the presence of signiﬁcant interatomic hybridization (as is the case for the Mn compound), and that the self-consistent evaluation of the eﬀective interaction parame- ters as material- and ground-state-dependent quantities allows the prediction of energy diﬀerences between diﬀerent phases and concentrations. I. INTRODUCTION The search for new and more performant materi- als for Li-ion batteries has received a strong impulse in the last decade, ﬁrst due to the development and diﬀusion of portable electronics and now also with a major focus on transportation and energy storage. These applications impose multiple requirements on the materials: of being light-weight, environmentally friendly, of having high gravimetric/volumetric en- ergy density, high power, fast rechargeability, long life, thermal/chemical stability, and low fabrication costs. Despite steady progress in recent years and the intro- duction of new types of rechargeable batteries (e.g., K- , Na-, Mg-ion [1–4], or Li-air ones [5, 6]) for dedicated purposes, many microscopic aspects of their behav- ior still need", "page": 0, "position": 0}

The constant eﬀorts to improve performance have stimu- lated a vigorous search for better materials, especially for electrolytes (in the attempt to design solid-state media able to sustain safely higher voltages than their liquid counterparts, and comparable ionic currents) [15–22] and for cathodes (in order to identify more conductive, safer systems with higher energy density, higher voltage) [10, 23–34]. Cathode materials are, in fact, particularly important for the improvement of rechargeable Li-ion batteries as these components are not only the source of power, but also embody some of the most critical bottlenecks towards the improve- ment of current technologies including weight, safety, energy density, and overall power. ∗Current address: Department of Physics, University of Pavia, Via Bassi 6, 27100 Pavia, Italy The relevance of the electronic and ionic degrees of freedom within the single particles or grains of the electrodes, and their role in determining the perfor- mance of Li-ion batteries (e.g., rate capability, en- ergy density), has made the use of ﬁrst-principles calculations fundamental in the understanding of their functionality and increasingly more common for the characterization and design of battery materi- als [28, 35–54]. Since the open-circuit voltage corre- sponds to the redox potential of the electro-chemically active species changing their oxidation state during the charge/discharge of the battery (these are often transition-metal ions), it is crucial for the energet- ics of various phases and compositions involved in the charge/discharge processes to be predicted ac- curately and reliably.

High predictive accuracy is also needed for other quantities besides the voltage and the stability of the diﬀerent phases appearing at intermediate Li concentrations, such as the forma- tion energies of defects, or the viability of diﬀerent doping strategies. A key diﬃculty in being quan- titatively accurate in these predictions comes from the presence of transition-metal (TM) ions, typically present in variable oxidation states. In fact, most approximate exchange-correlation functionals used in current implementations of density-functional theory (DFT) [55, 56], such as the local-density approxima- tion (LDA) or the generalized-gradient approximation (GGA), tend to over-stabilize delocalized states and are unable to capture accurately the localization of d electrons as a result of the remnant self-interaction er- rors present in functionals. Often, these errors lead to a distinct failure in describing the ground state of ma- terials at intermediate Li concentrations, predicting a metallic band structure and an even distribution of electronic charge on TM ions, rather than the correct mixed-valence ground state, with electrons localized on a subgroup of TM ions at a lower oxidation state. arXiv:1811.06586v3 [cond-mat.mtrl-sci] 26 Feb 2019", "page": 0, "position": 2}

For these reasons DFT calculations on these materials require functionals that are able to reduce or eliminate the spurious self-interaction that aﬀects most of current approximations, to deliver a more pronounced local- ization on TM ions and a faithful representation of mixed-valence ground states. Unfortunately, these re- quirements are very diﬃcult to satisfy for functionals of the electronic charge density alone; even the re- cently introduced SCAN semilocal meta-GGA density functional [57], while very promising for various sys- tems including layered oxides [58] and materials with well localized exchange-correlation holes [59], is not fully satisfactory for general systems aﬀected by the above-mentioned problems, especially inter-metallic transition-metal compounds [60, 61]. The partial re- moval of the electronic self-interaction by adding a fraction of Fock exchange, as in hybrid functionals, greatly improves the localization of electrons [62] (al- beit at a signiﬁcant computational cost), but might not solve problematic aspects related to energetics, as reported in Ref. [63] and detailed below. One meaningful alternative to correct for self- interaction errors is the DFT + Hubbard approach, where the exchange-correlation functional is aug- mented by a Hubbard-model Hamiltonian acting on localized states [64–72] (see in particular Refs [73, 74] for a discussion of self-interaction and DFT+U). This approach was ﬁrst applied to the study of cathode ma- terials by some of us (Refs. [75–77]); this work showed that DFT+U with eﬀective interactions computed from ﬁrst-principles [78], albeit averaged over diﬀerent Li contents, can promote a more pronounced localiza- tion of d electrons and predict average voltages (with respect to Li/Li+) in closer agreement with available experimental data, while also recovering the correct thermodynamics between phases. This eﬀort led to Hubbard-corrected DFT becoming a standard com- putational tool to perform predictive ﬁrst-principles calculations on Li-ion cathode materials, and over the last decade its use on these systems has been broad and successful [40, 42, 79–87].

Although the accuracy of the original application of DFT+U to these ma- terials was largely due to the possibility to compute the Hubbard parameter U from ﬁrst principles, its semiempirical evaluation was often preferred, proba- bly due to the complexity to evaluate U reliably and eﬃciently on every system of interest. Recent compu- tational studies on cathode materials conducted with various ﬂavors of DFT+U have also reiterated some key characteristics or shortcomings [88, 89], includ- ing i) its dependence on its environment (structural, magnetic, and electronic phases); ii) the impossibility to use material-dependent U’s in energy comparisons; iii) the variation of U in proximity of defects (e.g., impurities, local deformations of the lattice, surfaces, etc); iv) the diﬃculty to obtain a uniform improve- ment in the prediction of several properties with the same value of the Hubbard U [90]; v) the scarce relia- bility of DFT+U in presence of signiﬁcant hybridiza- tion between the metal cations and the neighbor an- ions. To circumvent these issues hybrid functionals have become an increasingly popular choice for calcu- lations [62, 91–93]. Although more computationally demanding, these functionals oﬀer the advantage of containing at most one adjustable parameter, namely the fraction of exact (Fock) exchange, typically deter- mined semiempirically [94] and held constant for all the systems analyzed. However, the overall quality of results obtained when using hybrid functionals turns out to be often comparable to those obtained with DFT+U or approximate DFT functionals [62, 95] with also some major qualitative failures, such as predict- ing a negative formation energy for Li0.5FePO4 [63], as mentioned earlier.

[74]). The present paper studies in detail a well known class of cathode materials - Li-metal phosphates with the olivine (orthorhombic) structure - with the aim of addressing some of the methodological issues out- lined above. These compounds, whose chemical for- mula is LixMPO4 (M = Fe, Mn in this work, with x varying between 0 and 1 during the discharge of the battery), represent a particularly appealing fam- ily for Li-ion batteries cathodes [96]. In fact, the presence of stable PO4 tetrahedra as structural link- ers improves the chemical stability of the cathode, reducing the chance of oxygen releases, and guaran- tees higher levels of safety for the device, especially if compared to that oﬀered by other materials, such as LiCoO2. Among the olivine phosphates LiFePO4 is of primary technological interest (in fact, it is already largely used in the fabrication of commercial batter- ies) and is the object of intense research activity that aims at understanding its electronic properties and the surprisingly high (and still somewhat controver- sial) charge/discharge rate that nanostructured cath- odes are able to sustain [41, 50, 97–104], despite its low ionic and electronic bulk conductivities. Ongo- ing research eﬀorts are also targeting, at a more ex- plorative level, other compounds of this family [105], with the main aim of improving the speciﬁc energy through higher voltages. While experiments assess- ing the performance of many of these compounds as cathode materials are made diﬃcult by the unavail- ability of electrolytes able to sustain voltages higher than", "page": 1, "position": 2}

As mentioned, this work will focus on two diﬀerent olivine phosphates that have, respectively, Fe or Mn as transition-metal cations. In particular, it will aim at determining the equilibrium structure of these ma- terials, the average voltage with respect to the Li/Li+ couple of a pure Li anode, the relative stability and the formation energy of compounds with diﬀerent Li con- tents (x = 0, 0.5, 1). Total energy calculations will be performed with an extended Hubbard-corrected func- tional (named DFT+U+V) that contains both on-site (U) and inter-site (V ) eﬀective electronic interactions [107]. The work will clearly show the beneﬁts of an improved description (thanks to the inter-site term V ) of the hybridization between transition-metal ions and their oxygen ligands to capture electronic localization and mixed-valence ground states. The presented re- sults will also highlight the critical importance to com- pute (speciﬁcally, from linear-response theory (LRT) calculations in supercells [78]), the Hubbard interac- tion parameters in full consistency with the electronic ground state and the crystal structure of the materials considered in order to achieve quantitatively reliable energetics. The reminder of the paper is structured as fol- lows. Section II is devoted to describing the ex- tended DFT+U+V functional and to discussing the self-consistent linear-response procedure adopted to compute the eﬀective electronic interactions, U and V . Section III presents the results obtained for each of the materials considered, comparing them with available experimental data (e.g., voltages, equilibrium crys- tal structures) and discussing the accuracy of diﬀer- ent computational approaches.

II. METHODOLOGY A. The DFT+U+V functional and the self-consistent evaluation of U and V The DFT+U+V method was introduced in Ref. [107] as a generalization of DFT+U (in its simplest, rotationally invariant formulation introduced by Du- darev et al. [68]), and it is based on an extended Hub- bard model [110–115] that contains both on-site (U) and inter-site (V ) electronic interactions. The total energy functional can be expressed as follows: EDF T +U+V = EDF T + X I,σ U I 2 Tr \u0002 nIIσ \u00001 −nIIσ\u0001\u0003 − ∗ X I,J,σ V IJ 2 Tr \u0002 nIJσnJIσ\u0003 (1) where the atomic Hubbard manifold occupation ma- trices, obtained from the projection of Kohn-Sham (KS) states on the atomic Hubbard manifold, have been generalized to allow for inter-atomic terms (I ̸= J): nIJσ m,m′ = X k,v f σ kv⟨ψσ kv|φJ m′⟩⟨φI m|ψσ kv⟩. (2) In Eq. 1 σ labels the spin of electrons while the star “*” over the second summation is a reminder that, for each atom I, the sum runs only over neighboring atoms J within a certain shell. The symbol “Tr” in- dicates the trace of the matrix to which it is applied, while the 1 in the second term represents the uni- tary matrix. In Eq. 2 f σ kv are the occupations of the KS states ψσ kv, labeled by a k-point index k and by a band index v, while φI m are atomic states of the atom I, labeled by the magnetic quantum number m. The present work only uses a ﬁnite inter-site interction V between the d states of TM ions", "page": 2, "position": 1}

In Eq. 2 f σ kv are the occupations of the KS states ψσ kv, labeled by a k-point index k and by a band index v, while φI m are atomic states of the atom I, labeled by the magnetic quantum number m. The present work only uses a ﬁnite inter-site interction V between the d states of TM ions and the p states of their oxygen neighbors. Based on the above deﬁni- tions, we note that Eq. 1 can also be rewritten more concisely as EDF T +U+V = EDF T + X σ TrW 2 [nσ (1 −nσ)] (3) where the “Tr” operator is now understood to act also on implicit site indexes and the interaction matrix W is such that WII = U I and WIJ = V IJ, ∀I ̸= J. In order to understand how this extended correc- tive functional modiﬁes the electronic structure of a system it is useful to study the action of the Hub- bard additional potential on a speciﬁc KS state. The generalized KS Hamiltonian can be obtained from the functional derivative of Eq. 3 with respect to the com- plex conjugate of the KS state: δEDF T +U+V δ(ψσ kv)∗ = VDF T +U+V |ψσ kv⟩= VDF T |ψσ kv⟩ + X I U I 2 X m,m′ \u0000δmm′ −2nIIσ m′m \u0001 |φI m⟩⟨φI m′|ψσ kv⟩ − ∗ X I,J V IJ X m,m′ nJIσ m′m|φI m⟩⟨φJ m′|ψσ kv⟩. (4) From the equation above it can be seen that while the on-site part of the potential discourages partial atomic occupations, stabilizing states that are either full or empty, the inter-site term favors states having signiﬁcant overlap with atomic states of neighboring atoms (thus contributing substantially to nJIσ m′m with", "page": 2, "position": 2}

Given this competition between the two types of interactions an accurate and consistent evaluation of both parameters is crucial. In our work this task is achieved by using the linear-response approach for the calculation of U, introduced in Ref. [78], and ex- tending it to the calculation of V , as discussed in Ref. [116]. Within this approach the inter-site interaction V can be obtained as the oﬀ-diagonal element of the interaction matrix of which U represents the diagonal part; this has already been shown to be accurate in a number of diﬀerent cases, from ionic oxides and co- valent semiconductors [107] to transition-metal com- plexes [117]. In order to fully capture the dependence of the ef- fective interactions on the electronic and crystal struc- tures, in the present work we adopt a self-consistent procedure for their calculation that is an evolution of the one introduced in Ref. [73] and, already discussed in Refs [107] and [116], has been used in a number of other studies afterwards [118–122]. A similar self- consistent approach was introduced, independently, in Ref. [81], albeit with some diﬀerences that will be highlighted below. The rationale of this approach re- lies on the evaluation of U and V using linear-response theory from a DFT+U+V ground state until self- consistency. In practice, starting from an initial choice of these parameters U 1 in and V 1 in (possibly equal to 0) a sequence of linear-response calculations is started in which the interactions obtained from the ith step are used to generate the DFT+U+V ground state of the next one: U i+1 in = U i out, V i+1 in = V i out (mixing schemes between “input” and “output” can be adopted to im- prove convergence). The sequence is terminated when input and output values of the eﬀective interactions coincide within a numerical threshold. In this work we also perform a structural optimization (of both cell parameters and atomic positions) in between two suc- cessive calculations of the interactions parameters, in order to guarantee full consistency of their values also with the crystal", "page": 3, "position": 0}

In this work we also perform a structural optimization (of both cell parameters and atomic positions) in between two suc- cessive calculations of the interactions parameters, in order to guarantee full consistency of their values also with the crystal structure. Indicating the interaction parameters with the general symbol W (W = {U, V }), the self-consistent procedure can be summarized as follows: W 1 in →SO(W 1 in) →LR(W 1 in) →W 1 out = W 2 in →SO(W 2 in) →LR(W 2 in) →W 2 out = W 3 in . . . . . . W i out = W i+1 in = W i in and ES(W i+1 in ) = ES(W i in) where “SO” stands for structural optimization and “ES” for equilibrium (crystal) structure. The se- quence is terminated when also the equilibrium crys- tal structure is converged. This procedure, which evolves the eﬀective interactions with the ground state of the system, allows to treat them as material- and environment-speciﬁc quantities (rather than as pa- rameters of the calculation, as in most literature on Hubbard corrections, often oblivious to the fact that Hubbard parameters need to be pseudopotential- speciﬁc) and this is one of the key aspects that will be discussed in this work. It is important to stress that the approach cho- sen for the self-consistent calculation of U’s and V ’s is slightly diﬀerent than that adopted in Ref. [81]: in fact, in the LRT calculations starting from a DFT+U+V ground state, the potential deriving from the Hubbard functional is kept ﬁxed (computing it on unperturbed atomic occupation matrices) to make sure that only the DFT part contributes to the second derivative that deﬁnes the eﬀective interactions. This procedure makes the evaluation of U and V consistent with their deﬁnition as eﬀective spurious curvatures of the DFT energy with respect to atomic occupations [78]. It is also consistent with the use of", "page": 3, "position": 1}

This procedure makes the evaluation of U and V consistent with their deﬁnition as eﬀective spurious curvatures of the DFT energy with respect to atomic occupations [78]. It is also consistent with the use of newly ob- tained values as a new guess for the next iteration, rather than as a correction to those of the previous step. A thourough comparative analysis of various self-consistent procedures for computing the Hubbard interaction parameters has been recently proposed in Ref [123]. It is useful to remark that, since the Hub- bard potential during the calculation of the Hubbard parameters is ﬁxed, the present work (as well as that of Ref. [107]) is consistent with and gives the same result of method 2 of Ref. [123] (the Uscf mentioned here corresponds to U (2) of that work). In fact, it can be proven that the Hubbard parameters calcu- lated through the procedure just illustrated corre- sponds to the (atomically averaged) matrix element of the Hartree and exchange-correlation kernel, com- puted at the DFT+U ground state with U = Uin. For the sake of a precise numerical comparison of the Hubbard interaction parameters obtained it would be appropriate to discuss screening of these quantities and how it is accounted for during their evaluation. This discussion is sketched in Ref. [124] presenting a linear-response calculation of the Hubbard parame- ters equivalent to (and based on) the one introduced in Ref. [78]. We remark here that the perturba- tion is screened by all the “other” electronic states, i.e. those that are not explicitly perturbed by a shift in the potential acting on them. This implies that, in principle, the Hubbard U calculated for DFT+U and DFT+U+V ground states can be expected to be diﬀerent from one another because the necessity to perturb neighbor ligand states for the evaluation of the inter-site V leads, for the latter, to the removal of these", "page": 3, "position": 2}

The validity of this choice was then assessed for DFT+U calculations on LixFePO4 by comparing the values of U obtained as outlined above with those from calcula- tions that did not include perturbations of O atoms. A further conﬁrmation of the quality of this approxima- tion is provided by the comparison with calculations of the Hubbard parameters based on DFPT[109], as is detailed in the Supplementary Information [108]. B. Formation energies and voltages Most of the results presented in this work concern the evaluation of formation energies and (average) voltages, of which this section provides a deﬁnition. Given a generic system S (able to reversibly inter- calate Li ions in its structure) the formation energy of the compound LixS (0 ≤x ≤1) with respect to the LiS and S component is evaluated as a weighted diﬀerence of total energies: Ef(x) = E(LixS) −xE(LiS) −(1 −x)E(S). (5) This formula is approximate at ﬁnite temperatures, where the diﬀerence between free energies (rather than total/internal energies) should be considered. While widely used in literature, the cancellation between the entropic terms seems a reasonable assumption for the vibrational part, while the conﬁgurational (e.g., ionic, electronic, magnetic) contributions to the en- tropy should, in principle, be handled with care. This is a particularly diﬃcult task for intermediate Li con- centrations. In fact, while for fully lithiated and delithiated compounds (x = 0 and x = 1) this only involves screening diﬀerent spin conﬁgurations of the transition-metal ions, at fractional values of x addi- tional important terms arise from the Li fractional oc- cupation of available sites [125–128] and from the elec- tronic “conﬁgurational entropy” related to the local- ization of valence d electrons on a subset of transition- metal ions. This latter term can in fact determine the stabilization of intermediate compounds, as pre- viously discussed for LixFePO4 [86]. In this work, following most of the literature on the topic, the evaluation of the stability of compounds at intermediate Li content will be based on total energies.

A signiﬁcant eﬀort has been focused however on cap- turing the localization of electrons on transition-metal ions (i.e. the diﬀerentiation of these ions in subgroups of diﬀerent valence) and on the quantitative compar- ison of diﬀerent Li conﬁgurations at x = 0.5. Another important quantity that can be evaluated from the direct comparison of total energies is the volt- age (i.e. the Li intercalation potential) with respect to an ideal Li/Li+ anode. For a generic system S, considered as a cathode material, this quantity is in general a function of the Li content (although most valuable systems show no/very low dependence of the voltage on x, at least for a good part of the admissible range). Its average value, between Li concentrations x1 and x2 (x2 > x1) can be computed as: φx1,x2 = −E(Lix2S) −E(Lix1S) −(x2 −x1)E(Li) (x2 −x1)e . (6) The total energies entering this formula are obviously referred to the same amount of material (e.g., one for- mula unit or one unit cell of the crystal) and E(Li) represents the total energy of an equivalent number of Li atoms in bulk Li (representing the anode), while e stands for the electronic charge. As noted for the cal- culation of formation energies and also for voltages, total energies should be replaced by total free ener- gies; however, it is a common practice to compare voltages obtained from total energies with the results of experiments at ﬁnite T. The assumption of cancel- lation of the entropic terms in the diﬀerence between free energies is on ﬁrmer ground than in the evalu- ation of formation energies if voltages are computed across the whole range of variation of Li content, i.e. between x1 = 0 and x2 = 1, because", "page": 4, "position": 1}

In this work we will adopt this common practice and will evaluate the average volt- ages balancing the total energies of fully lithiated and delithiated compounds. This quantity assumes a par- ticularly simple expression that corresponds to the for- mation energy of the fully lithiated compounds (with respect to the delithiated one and bulk Li) normalized by the electronic charge: φ = −E(LiS) −E(S) −E(Li) e . (7) III. TECHNICAL DETAILS The ﬁrst-principles calculations presented in this work are all performed using the pseudopotential, plane-wave implementation of DFT contained in the Quantum ESPRESSO distribution [129, 130]. In all cases a generalized-gradient approximation (GGA) functional is chosen, constructed with the PBEsol parametrization [131], particularly well suited for crystalline solids. In the calculations discussed in this work diﬀerent systems were modeled with pseudopo- tentials of diﬀerent types: the Fe olivine was described with ultrasoft pseudopotentials [132] taken from the Pslibrary 1.0.0 [133] [134], while for the Mn compound PAW pseudopotentials [135] were taken from the Psli- brary 0.3.1 [136] [137] following the Standard Solid State Pseudopotentials library (SSSP) validation pro- tocols [138]. More detailed informations about the pseudopotentials and the parameters used in the cal- culations are given in the sections dedicated to pre- senting results on speciﬁc systems.

As can be observed from Fig. 1, transition-metal ions are coordinated by six oxygen octahedra that are dis- torted from their ideal, cubic symmetry and tilted with respect to neighbor ones. TM-O octahedra are connected to each other either by sharing apical oxy- gens or by PO4 tetrahedra which also share apical oxygens and act as structural linkers. This structural framework, which is the same also in the Mn phos- phate, undergoes relatively minor but TM-dependent distortions upon Li insertion. This structural stabil- ity (together with the chemical one) is one of the main aspects that makes these crystals good cathode ma- terials, as it enables the possibility to undergo sev- eral lithiation cycles with minimal structural damage.

Since the system has an insulating ground state, in prin- ciples it could be treated within a ﬁxed-occupations scheme. However, starting the self-consistent calcula- tion of the Hubbard parameters from a DFT ground state, typically metallic, requires the use of a ﬁnite smearing of occupations that also facilitates, from a technical point of view, the description of magnetic systems. The same four-formula-units supercell is also used to compute the Hubbard interaction parameters us- ing the linear-response method introduced in [78]. For DFT+U+V calculations the eﬀective interactions of the Fe and Mn olivines are also computed in a 1×2×2 supercell of the one described above, to study the convergence of the Hubbard interactions with the cell size. It is important to remark that, as already discussed in Ref [107], computing V does not re- quire any modiﬁcation to the linear-response (LR) approach introduced in [78] (in fact, V is obtained as the oﬀ-diagonal element of the atomic interac- tion matrix); however, it implies perturbing also non transition-metal states, which increases proportion- ally the cost of the LR calculations. In the present work, since calculations include inter-site interactions between transition-metal ions and their ﬁrst neigh- bors, oxygen atoms are also individually perturbed. More speciﬁcally, perturbations are imposed on the 3d states of transition-metal ions and on the 2p states of oxygens. While perturbing oxygens’ p states is strictly necessary only for DFT+U+V calculations, the procedure outlined above was adopted also for on-site-only DFT+U calculations. A second series of calculation of the Hubbard parameters was per- formed for both the DFT+U and DFT+U+V cases, using a new implementation of the linear-response method based on density-functional perturbation the- ory (DFPT) [109].

In any case this is common practice in all implementations of DFT+U. IV. RESULTS A. LixFePO4 1. Electronic structure and energetics Among TM phosphates with the olivine (or- thorhombic) structure, LixFePO4 is currently the most widely used in commercial Li-ion batteries and certainly one of the most intensely studied in liter- ature. In fact, after it was proposed as a potential cathode material in 1997 [96], due to its relatively high capacity, superior thermal, chemical and mechan- ical stability, low cost and environmental-friendliness of its components, this material has become the ob- ject of a fervent research activity aimed at improv- ing the understanding of its properties and its behav- ior when employed in actual devices. While the use of nanostructured cathodes has allowed to overcome the low ionic and electronic conductivities of this ma- terial (thus permitting its large-scale deployment in commercial devices), the microscopic diﬀusion mech- anisms [39, 40, 46, 48, 103, 141–147] and the nucle- ation, relative stability and transformation dynamics of various phases [47, 50, 86, 97–99, 101, 148–154] oc- curring during the charge and discharge transients of the battery are still matter of intense research. In fact, in light of the very limited miscibility of Li-rich and Li-poor phases (somewhat increased at the nanoscale due to the higher free energy costs for the creation of interfaces [45, 155, 156]), the explanations of the relatively fast charge and discharge cycles observed in nanostructured cathodes is still quite controversial, as it is expected to involve out-of-equilibrium phenomena such as phase-transformation wave dynamics [104], metastable intermediate phases [97, 99, 149, 151], or solid solutions [41, 98, 102].

This diﬃculty in inter- preting the observed behavior constitutes a further motivation to precisely assess the energetics, the equi- librium crystal structure and the relative stability of the material at diﬀerent Li concentrations, which is the main scope of this work. As mentioned in Section III the transition-metal phosphates studied here are modeled with an or- thorhombic 24-atoms unit cell (unless explicitly in- dicated) that corresponds to four formula units (see Fig. 1). This cell is large enough to accommodate a few antiferromagnetic states and Li conﬁgurations which will be compared in the last part of this sec- tion. While the energy scale of inter-atomic magnetic interactions makes the comparison of various AFM conﬁgurations marginally relevant for the energetics of the material (in particular, for its average voltage and the formation energy of the half-lithiated com- pound) especially at ﬁnite temperatures, this compar- ative analysis is still interesting to better understand the electronic structure of cathode materials [157] and, in general, to improve their characterization (in com- parison with experiments) [158, 159], especially if a signiﬁcant shift of magnetic properties (e.g., the N´eel temperature) is expected to correlate with Li interca- lation. All the calculations shown in the ﬁrst part are performed for the antiferromagnetic ordering (named AF1 in the later discussion) that was veriﬁed to cor- respond to the ground state conﬁguration. The com- parative evaluation of diﬀerent phases of the partially lithiated system is, instead, more important to as- sess cathode performance. In fact, the mechanisms and kinetics of the (de-)lithiation process during the charge and discharge transients are governed by how Li ions intercalate into the structure of the partially lithiated material.

While the topic is still controversial (the thickness and orien- tation of interfacial half-lithiated phases is observed to depend on the size of the particles [99, 151] and possi- bly on the operational conditions [102]), assessing the relative stability (i.e. the energy of formation) and comparing the crystal structures of crystals with in- termediate Li content with those of the fully lithiated and de-lithiated compounds provides relevant infor- mation to evaluate the energy cost to form these in- terfaces, the magnitude of strains in their surrounding that might contribute to their stabilization, and the kinetics of Li ions inside the electrodes’ bulk. In this work we will consider two speciﬁc half-lithiated crys- tals, both alternating fully occupied and unoccupied Li planes, that are parallel to the yz plane in the ﬁrst case, and to the xz plane in the second one. These structures will be called “yz” and “xz”, respectively. Since a full set of calculations with all the various ﬂa- vors of Hubbard corrections was performed only for the ﬁrst of the half-lithiated structures, the second will be considered only in the last part of the section, in the context of a quantitative comparison between the two. The calculations on the Fe olivine were performed using an ultrasoft pseudopotential for Fe (with semi- core 3s and 3p states in valence, along with 4s and 4p) that required kinetic energy cut-oﬀs of 85 and 650 Ry for the electronic wavefunctions and charge density, respectively.

DFT+Uave and DFT+U are both based on standard Hubbard corrective function- als (i.e. the ﬁrst two terms in Eq. 1); however, the Hubbard U is computed in two diﬀerent ways, one common in the literature, and one presented here. In DFT+Uave, GGA is used to optimize the structure at x = 0, 0.5 and 1. The Hubbard U is then computed from a single-shot LR calculation for each of these three crystals in their respective equilibrum conﬁgu- rations and averaged over them. The average value of the Hubbard U obtained in this way is then used to calculate the total energy of the crystal for the three Li concentrations and to evaluate the (average) voltage and the formation energy of the x = 0.5 compounds, without further optimization of the crystal structure. This is the common procedure followed in literature when the Hubbard U is computed from ﬁrst principles rather than being determined semi-empirically by ﬁt- ting existing experimental data; for this reason the DFT+Uave results will be used as a benchmark with respect to those from the other corrective functionals used in this work. Instead, in DFT+U (and also in DFT+U+V) the Hubbard interaction parameters are computed self-consistently (both with the electronic and crystal structures), according to the procedure described previously in section II A. In particular, the inter-site Hubbard interactions (V ) are computed and used between Fe and nearest-neighbor oxygen ions. In these cases, no averaging is performed and all en- ergy balances are obtained from calculations using material-speciﬁc and Li-concentration dependent U’s and V ’s.

For Li0.5FePO4 the two sets of values refer to the Fe2+ and Fe3+ ions, respectively. Table I shows the values of all the interaction param- eters computed for each of the Li concentrations con- sidered for the Fe olivine and for the ﬂavors of the Hubbard corrective functionals outlined above. Ad- ditional results can be found in Table ??. It is easy to note that the value of U obtained from a single- shot LR calculation on the GGA ground state (and averaged) is signiﬁcantly higher than all the others, which is probably a consequence of the lack of con- sistency with the electronic ground state. Substantial diﬀerences between the self-consistent values of the Hubbard parameters can also be noted comparing the results at diﬀerent Li concentrations (i.e., in depen- dence of the level of oxidation of the metal ion) or the results of diﬀerent approaches when the same material or the same oxidation state of Fe are considered. For example, the value of V between Fe2+ 3d and O 2p states changes depending on whether the Fe ion is one of LiFePO4 or of Li0.5FePO4. Equally signiﬁcant dif- ferences can in fact be noted comparing the values of U obtained for Li0.5FePO4 and FePO4 within diﬀer- ent ﬂavours of the Hubbard correction or for Fe ions in the x = 0.5 compound and those in the same oxi- dation state in either fully lithiated or delithiated ma- terials.", "page": 7, "position": 1}

These diﬀerences, which are the result of the self-consistent procedure adopted in the calculation of U’s and V ’s, conﬁrm a sensitivity of their values on the ﬁne details of the chemical and crystal environ- ments of the transition-metal ions they refer to, and suggest a limited portability of these parameters from one system to another, even when treated within the same approximations. Based on these observations, we argue that the Hubbard interactions should not be considered as pa- rameters of the calculation, nor should be thought of as simple functions of average quantities. We prefer instead to view these as quantities that depend on the electronic structure of the system, whose value is determined self-consistently by the ground state they contribute to determine. This point of view justiﬁes our self-consistent calculation of the Hubbard inter- action parameters, which is further supported by the overall agreement of the equilibrium crystal structure (Table II) with the experimental data for DFT+U+V and the signiﬁcant improvement over DFT+U ob- tained with the introduction of the inter-site inter- action V in the energetics and electronic structure (see later), in spite of the quite broad range of self-", "page": 7, "position": 2}

[160] and Ref. [96], respectively). As apparent from Table II, the DFT+U functional tends to expand the equilibrium lattice parameters with respect to those obtained from GGA calcula- tions. The presence of inter-site interactions partially counteracts this tendency, and mitigates the eﬀect of the on-site eﬀective repulsion U. For LiFePO4, com- pared to available experimental data of Ref. [160] and [96], GGA uncharacteristically underestimates the equilibrium lattice parameters while DFT+U pro- duces an optimized unit cell in quite good agree- ment with the data. This result is further reﬁned by DFT+U+V. Because of the experimental diﬃculties in stabilizing any compound at intermediate Li con- centration, no measurement of the equilibrium lattice parameter of Li0.5FePO4 is, to the best of our knowl- edge, available. As for the x = 1 case, we can observe that DFT+U leads to an expansion of the equilib- rium lattice parameters compared to GGA. However, at variance with the fully lithiated case, the addition of the inter-site interaction V yields a further expan- sion of the lattice.

In fact, one should observe the occupations in the mixed-valence Fe2+/Fe3+ case mirroring those of the pure 2+ or 3+ cases. This failure results from the incomplete localization of va- lence electrons on the d states due to the defective cancellation of the electronic self-interaction, that is a well known problem of most approximate DFT func- tionals. DFT+U is eﬀective in ﬁxing this problem [38–42, 75–77] and, favoring integer occupations of atomic states, stabilizes a charge-disproportionated ground states thus leading to a clear distinction be- tween 2+ and 3+ Fe ions. In fact, as evident from the DFT+Uave results in Table III, consistently with previous work, half of the Fe ions in Li0.5FePO4 have an occupation that closely resembles that of the (2+) Fe ions in LiFePO4, the other half that of the (3+) Fe ions in FePO4. When the Hubbard U is computed self-consistently, within DFT+U, the roles of 2+ and 3+ are inverted: the 2+ Fe is not the one closest to the Li, as expected, but the one furthest apart. However, as it will be discussed later, this is a spurious result, probably a consequence of the system getting trapped in a local minimum of the energy. Using the extended corrective functional DFT+U+V, the Fe ions closest to Li correctly recover their 2+ state. The results shown in Table III are based on a L¨owdin population analysis of Fe 3d states, accord- ing to the deﬁnition given in Eq. 2. That the numeri- cal values are not in agreement with chemical practice (that would attribute 6 d electrons to Fe2+ and 5 to Fe3+) is related to both the mathematical deﬁnition of the occupation matrices (not a univocal choice), to the physics of the system (e.g., some degree of hybridization between Fe 3d states and neighboring O 2p states) and, in general, to other reasons dis- cussed in Ref.[161, 162].

However, it is important to remark that our Hubbard corrections recover an elec- tronic structure that is fully consistent with a charge- disproportionated state, with Fe2+ and Fe3+ ions de- scribed in full consistency with the end-members of the LixFePO4 system. Regarding the formation energy of the x = 0.5 compound, the GGA calculations return a negative value, that contradicts the lack of observation of stable phases at x = 0.5. These results conﬁrm the conclu- sions of previous work [75] that already showed how this situation is due to the over-stabilization of the in- correct metallic state obtained at intermediate Li con- tent (both the x = 0 and x = 1 materials are predicted to be insulators) which lowers the total energy of the x = 0.5 compound compared to the weighted average of the fully lithiated and delithiated end points. The incomplete localization of valence electrons is also at the origin of the signiﬁcant underestimation (-0.8 V) of the voltage: in fact, this quantity can be broadly related to the energy made available to the system by each Fe ion when it is reduced from a 3+ to a 2+ oxidation state. By promoting the localization of va- lence d electrons DFT+U reverts this tendency and produces a positive formation energy for x = 0.5 and a voltage in much better agreeement with the experi- mental value. However, the best results are obtained when the inter-site V between Fe 3d and O 2p states is switched on, leading to a predicted voltage which is less than 0.1 V oﬀfrom the experimental value.

As evident from the ﬁgure, while the GGA (PBEsol) functional pre- dicts a metallic behavior with the Fermi level of the system crossing the minority-spin d states, DFT+U is eﬀective in opening a band gap (of about 4.5 eV if the average value of U is used) in the Kohn-Sham spectrum of the material by separating a single occu- pied minority-spin d state from the rest of its manifold (Fe2+ has nominally six d electrons and in its highest spin conﬁguration has ﬁve electrons in one spin state and the remaining one in the other). DFT+U+V also predicts an insulating ground state; however the band gap is lower (≈4 eV) than in DFT+U and closer to the experimental value (≈3.7 eV). Another notable diﬀerence from the on-site only DFT+U is that the occupied minority-spin d state shows a lower contri- bution in the energy window dominated by oxygen p states and majority-spin d states, while it dominates the energy window at the top of the valence manifold with a strong peak. On a more technical level, it is fair to remark that the DFT+Uave and the DFT+U results presented above can be expected to be slightly less accurate than the others, since", "page": 9, "position": 2}

As mentioned at the end of section II A, this can lead to the under-screening of the eﬀective inter- action parameter that results from the linear-response calculations. In order to precisely assess the entity of this approximation DFT+Uave calculations were re- peated for LixFePO4 with a Hubbard U computed from a linear-response procedure that only involved perturbing Fe ions. The value of the Hubbard U ob- tained this way (after averaging over the results of the three calculations at x = 0, 0.5 and 1), is 6.25 eV which, due to the additional screening from the oxygen p states, is more than 0.5 eV lower than the one computed previously (see Table I).

The details of these results are presented in the Sup- plementary Information [108]. An important outcome of these calculations is that the better control oﬀered by DFPT on the convergence of the Hubbard param- eters and the lower numerical noise they are aﬀected by in smaller cells might help avoiding local minima (actually relatively common with Hubbard corrected functionals) along the self-consistent calculation of in- teractions, electronic and crystal structures, as the one found within DFT+U for Li0.5FePO4 and leading to the swapping of 2+ and 3+ Fe", "page": 10, "position": 0}

Li-ion and magnetic conﬁgurations After a thorough discussion and a quantitative anal- ysis of the results of various Hubbard corrections a comparison is now performed between diﬀerent pos- sible conﬁgurations of the magnetic moments local- ized on the Fe ions and between two Li orderings already introduced at the beginning of this section, alternating full and empty Li planes parallel, respec- tively, to the yz and the xz crystallographic planes. These comparative analyses will be aimed at estab- lishing the most energetically favorable conﬁgurations and at assessing, through the evaluation of energy dif- ferences, the possibility for the system to visit higher energy (metastable) conﬁgurations, e.g. under the non equilibrium conditions it experiences during the charge/discharge transients of the battery, especially in high currents regimes [41, 97, 102]. a b c AF1 AF2 AF3 FM Fe1 0.00 0.00 0.00 ↑ ↑ ↑ ↑ Fe2 0.50 0.00 0.55 ↑ ↓ ↓ ↑ Fe3 0.94 0.50 0.50 ↓ ↓ ↑ ↑ Fe4 0.44 0.50 0.05 ↓ ↑ ↓ ↑ ∆E 0.0 3.1 12.1 16.1 TABLE IV.

The comparison is further eased by Fig. 3 which oﬀers a visual representation of the unit cell for the x = 1 material (although Li ions were removed from the picture) in the four conﬁgura- tions considered. The arrows on the Fe ions indicate their magnetic moments. Since all calculations were performed with a collinear spin functional and with no spin-orbit coupling, the direction of the magnetic mo- ments of the Fe ions is arbitrary and the arrows in the ﬁgure point in a generic direction. In the ﬁrst con- ﬁguration (AF1) the antiferromagnetic ground state is realized by ferromagnetic (010) planes alternating with opposite magnetization. This spacial distribu- tion of magnetic moments implies that when Fe-O oc- tahedra share one vertex oxygen their magnetization is antiparallel; conversely, their moments are parallel if they are connected through a P-O tetrahedron. In the second conﬁguration (AF2), instead, each Fe has a magnetic momentum antiparallel to that of all its ﬁrst neighbors, independently from how their octahe- dra are connected. Finally, the third antiferromag- netic conﬁguration (AF3) consists of ferromagnetic (100) planes alternating with opposite magnetization. As reported in Table IV, total energies of the various magnetic conﬁgurations are ordered as follows: EAF 1 < EAF 2 < EAF 3 < EF M. This ordering is consistent with previous work in literature [157, 160] (at least for the ground and ﬁrst-excited states) and is robust with respect the particular approximation being used, although the energy diﬀerences between the various magnetic orders varies with the speciﬁc ﬂavor of Hub- bard correction in use. For example, for the PBEsol functional the energies of AF2 and AF3 are about 10.8, 19.3 meV/f.u. higher than that of AF1, respectively.

The antiferromagnetic conﬁguration that results as the ground state is the same adopted in the ﬁrst part of this section for all three Li concentrations consid- ered. The comparison between various magnetic or- ders presented here thus provides an a-posteriori justi- ﬁcation for adopting it in the ﬁrst place. Relaxing the crystal structures turned out, in all cases, irrelevant for the ordering reported above (the reported energies are the ones obtained from the optimized structures in all cases) and, in many cases, changed very little the energy splittings between the various phases. This re- sult was obtained without adapting self-consistently the U and V interaction parameters and maintaining their value equal to that of the groumd state AF1. However, based on the relatively minor changes in the crystal structure and on the weak dependence of the atomic charge on the relative spin arrangement, this approximation is expected to be quite good. A further point in support of this procedure is the relative nu- merical irrelevance of the inter-site Fe-Fe terms of the response matrices (which are expected to be aﬀected the most by a change in the relative spin orientation) in determining the values of U’s and V ’s.

A second important comparative analysis is now de- veloped between two Li conﬁgurations for the half- lithiated Li0.5FePO4 material, shown in Fig. 4. The ﬁrst of them (Fig. 4(a)), with Li occupying alter- nate yz planes (thus named “yz” here) has been pro- posed to be forming in the surrounding of the in- terface between the x = 0 and x = 1 regions in small particles of the partially lithiated system, dur- ing the charge/discharge transients (at least at low (de)lithiation rates) or after they have reached the equilibrium conﬁguration (the observed samples were obtained by disassembling a half-charged battery, cy- cled at low rates) [99, 151]. According to these works this intermediate x = 0.5 phase is stabilized by the relaxation of the interfacial stress between lithiated and delithiated regions (due to a milder lattice mis- match) until the energetic cost of its formation oﬀ- sets the gain in elastic energy. The relaxation of interfacial elastic energy is also corroborated by the observation that the thickness of this half-lithiated layer depends inversely on the size of the particle [99]. A previous computational study on this intermedi- ate phase has highlighted instead its role in enhanc- ing the motion of the-above mentioned interfaces dur- ing the charge and discharge of the battery through a signiﬁcant reduction (compared to a sharp inter- face) of the kinetic barriers Li has to overcome dur- ing its diﬀusion throughout the material [50]. The second of these half-lithiated phases, with Li occupy- ing alternate xz planes (and named “xz”), has been proposed to be one of the intermediate conﬁgura- tions the system visits when the (de)lithiation pro- cess, at high charge/discharge rates (high overpoten- tials and currents), proceeds through non-equilibrium solid", "page": 12, "position": 0}

This mechanism is expected to be viable even at relatively low temperatures due to the low formation energy of a plethora of partially lithiated phases with respect to the end members. Based on the results presented previously, our comparative analy- sis on these crystals is based on DFT+U+V calcula- tions only, with U and V evaluated self-consistently with both the electronic and crystal structures as ex- plained in section III, for both conﬁgurations. The main result of our calculations concerns the total en- ergy of the two x = 0.5 phases. We obtain the second phase to be lower in energy than the ﬁrst by about 65 meV per formula unit and, with a formation energy of 42.5 meV per formula unit, it results in being rel- atively more accessible for a system at ﬁnite temper- atures. While signiﬁcantly lower than that of the yz conﬁguration, this formation energy is however some- what higher than that reported in Refs. [41, 102], obtained from Monte Carlo simulations. It is inter- esting to note that the diﬀerent position of Li ions also induces a redistribution of valence electrons on the transition-metal ions; in particular, between the two conﬁgurations, the Fe ions swap their oxidation state (the ones that are in a 2+ state in the ﬁrst be- come 3+ in the second, and viceversa). Consistently with chemical intuition and with the localized nature of d electrons, the Fe ions that are closer to the Li re- sult in both cases in the 2+ oxidation state, thus con- ﬁrming that Li motion correlates with the diﬀusion of localized electronic charges in their neighborood.

The use of the extended Hubbard correction, with a consistent calcu- lation of the interaction parameters, produces instead a consistent description of the two valence states of Fe ions (both categories of Fe ions having practically the same atomic occupation in the two conﬁgurations) while polarizing the crystal structure around Fe ions consistently with their valence.

B. LixMnPO4 1. Electronic structure and energetics The potential of LixMnPO4 (LMPO) as a possi- ble cathode material for Li-ion batteries was already recognized in the seminal work by Padhi et al. [96] that has ﬁrst promoted phospho-olivines as positive electrode materials. Compared to the isostructural LFPO, LMPO presents a higher voltage (4.1 V vs Li/Li+) which is quite an appealing feature in perspec- tive of its use in higher energy density cathodes, still within the breakdown potential of most liquid elec- trolytes currently available. Unfortunately, LMPO is also plagued by several problems that have so far prevented its deployment in actual devices. Among these, particularly harmful are a lower chemical sta- bility (especially of the delithiated phase) that makes the material prone to parasitic reactions with conse- quent rapid loss of capacity; possibly less safe and more diﬃcult to synthesize using the same techniques successful for LFPO[163–165]; a larger volume/lattice mismatch between lithiated and de-lithiated phases that increases the chances of permanent structural de- fects at interfaces and makes the material loose its cy- clability more rapidly [166, 167]; a diﬃcult deposition of C on the surface of nanostructured LMPO sam- ples, needed to improve their electronic conductivity [164, 168, 169]; the Jahn-Teller (JT) activity of Mn3+ ions (in the delithiated phase), promoting quite signif- icant structural distortions in their local environment (in particular of the oxygen cage around them) and abrupt changes also in the electronic structure that may impact negatively the performance of the ma- terial.

The most serious problem for using LMPO in actual devices is represented, however, by its low ionic and electronic conductivities that, while further com- promised by passivation events during the charge and discharge of the battery or by lattice disorder (with Mn2+ ions possibly obstructing the Li diﬀusion chan- nels) [167], are generally attributed to the signiﬁcant lattice polarization around injected charges (leading to the formation of polarons) that are caused or en- hanced by the JT activity of Mn3+ ions and result in sluggish motion of the charge carriers (i.e., high eﬀective masses or higher kinetic barriers for the hop- ping to neighbor sites) [63, 170]. The necessity to ﬁnd a way around these problems and to deﬁne viable strategies to employ LMPO in actual cathodes of Li batteries has stimulated a quite lively research activ- ity on this material (summarized, e.g., in Ref. [165]) that has encompassed the precise characterization of its structural, magnetic and electrochemical proper- ties [170, 171], but also the development of new fabri- cation techniques that could improve its performance as cathode material [167–169, 172–175]. Several com- putational studies have also been performed on this system, generally focusing on the electronic, magnetic, structural and vibrational properties of LMPO [176]. A particular attention in this context has been de- voted to the study of the local distortion around the (possibly JT-active) 3+ Mn ions and to its impact on the ionic and electronic conductivities [166, 177], oc- casionally addressed quantitatively through the eval- uation of relevant kinetic barriers [63].

A similar comparative analysis between the three mate- rials is also performed discussing the crystal structures (with a particular focus on the local environment of Mn ions), the number of electrons on their d orbitals (directly related to their oxidation state) and the total energies. The latter will be employed for the calcula- tion of the formation energy of the x = 0.5 system and of the average voltage vs Li/Li+. Because of the role played by the hybridization between Mn and O in determining the local distortion of the crystal and its transport properties, LMPO will represent a partic- ularly signiﬁcant test case for the extended Hubbard functional discussed in this work and will highlight the importance of the inter-site interactions to capture the properties of systems where valence electrons do not completely localize on atomic states. As in the case of LFPO, also for this system a comparative anal- ysis is performed between various antiferromagnetic conﬁgurations of the x = 1 compound and between diﬀerent possible ordered phases of the half-lithiated material. Given the similarity between the two sys- tems, the same Li and magnetic conﬁgurations of the Fe-based material are considered.

At the same time, the eﬀective interactions change their values also in dependence of the speciﬁc Hubbard functional adopted in their self- consistent evaluation. For example, the value of U varies quite signiﬁcantly depending on whether the inter-site V is used in the total energy calculations or not, and on whether structural relaxations are in- volved in the procedure.

However, for x = 0 the best agreement with experimental results is obtained from GGA (slightly overestimating lattice parameters), while DFT+U+V shows a mismatch with the experimental cell parame- ters in the 2 - 3% range. This result, at variance with what was obtained for FPO (see Table II), is some- what surprising in light of the overall improvement obtained with DFT+U+V on the electronic structure and energetics (average voltage) of the material (see below). The half-lithiated compound, modeled by the same “staged” arrangement of Li atoms also used for LFPO, deserves special attention. In fact, as evi- dent from Table VI, the lower symmetry of the crystal structure can lead to signiﬁcant distortions of the unit cell. While GGA and DFT+U stabilize an eﬀectively monoclinic cell (with only the β angle deviating sig- niﬁcantly from 90◦), the use of inter-site interactions V in the corrective functionals leads to an equilibrium triclinic unit cell with all the angles between cell vec- tors deviating from 90◦.

Table VII reports the total occupation of Mn atoms in the three Mn compounds considered and compares the average voltages and the formation energies for the half-lithiated crystal obtained from diﬀerent Hubbard corrections. At variance with LFPO, the DFT+U with on-site only corrections is not eﬀective in cap- turing the disproportionation of the L¨owdin charges in the half-lithiated compound and the diﬀerence be- tween the occupation of 2+ and 3+ Mn ions in this case is only marginally larger than that predicted by GGA. When using the inter-site V , instead, the oc- cupations of 2+ and 3+ ions are obtained in precise consistency with the fully lithiated (2+) and delithi- ated (3+) cases, showing the eﬀectiveness of this cor- rective functional in capturing electronic localization in presence of signiﬁcant hybridization. Regarding the formation energies, while they result positive in all the approximations considered, their values increase when a Hubbard correction (of any type) is used, proba- bly due to the destabilization of the metallic ground state that is, instead, obtained from GGA calculations for the half-lithiated material. For the average volt- age, however, while GGA signiﬁcantly underestimates experiments, DFT+U overestimates them. The best agreement with experimental measurements of this quantity is obtained again within DFT+U+V.

The results of this work are shown in Fig. 5 with the same color convention already used in Fig. 2 for LFPO. For the correct interpretation of these results it is useful to keep in mind that Mn ions are nominally in a 3+ oxidation state in this compound with four electrons in their d shells. Because of their high-spin conﬁgura- tion, the presence of a hole in their d manifold should result in a majority-spin d state moved above (and separated by an energy gap from) the top of the va- lence band. As clearly shown in Fig. 5 this is only obtained when a ﬁnite inter-site interaction V is used in the (extended) Hubbard functional [Fig. 5(c)].

This re- sult is in agreement with Ref. [179]. In contrast with that work, instead, our DFT+U calculations do not predict a semiconducting ground state and only re- sult in an upward shift of the energy of minority-spin d states that are minimally overlapping with oxygen p states. The highest energy majority-spin d state of Mn, instead, probably because of its mixed d-p charac- ter (as suggested by the presence of both contributions in the peak right above the Fermi level), is predicted to be contiguous with the top of the valence band.

From the comparison of DFT+U and DFT+U+V results it is important to note that the inter-site interaction mostly aﬀects the top of the valence band, where the gap opens. In other regions of the energy spectrum its eﬀect seem to be minor, even if the overlap between Mn d and O p states is signiﬁcant. This insensitiv- ity is probably the result of two opposite factors that compensate each other: a smaller on-site Hubbard U and a ﬁnite inter-site V (see table V). The hybridization-driven band-gap opening and hole localization described above for MPO is analo- gous to that discussed in Ref. [63] focusing on the localization of an electron/hole polaron in LMPO. In that work DFT+U was found unable to achieve the full localization of the defect charge and is reported to predict a metallic behavior under all conditions. In order to predict a localized extra charge in the mate- rial a hybrid functional was used, whose main eﬀect is to push the energy of the unoccupied majority-spin d state of one Mn ion into the band gap of the material. The results described above, although obtained from charge-neutral calculations, suggest that DFT+U+V could achieve a similar result. As in the case of LFPO, the results presented above are validated by a series of self-consistent calculations including structural optimizations and Hubbard pa- rameters evaluations from the DFPT[109].

In particular, the energy diﬀerences are (in meV per formula unit): 2.2, 12.3, 15.5 from DFT+U+V and 4.7, 35.4 and 43.4 in GGA (PBEsol) calculations. In analogy with LiFePO4 these energy diﬀerences are irrelevant for the evaluation of forma- tion energies and average voltages. Their small value (actually comparable with the precision of our calcu- lation) suggest that all these magnetic conﬁgurations can be reached even at moderate temperatures. (a) (b) (c) (d) FIG. 6.

Based on the clear improvement brought about by the extended DFT+U+V scheme compared to other Hub- bard ﬂavors, as evident from the results presented in the previous section, calculations were performed only with this functional and with uncorrected GGA for comparison. As in the case of LiFePO4, the conﬁgu- ration with Li ﬁlling alternate xz planes has lower en- ergy than the one with Li on alternate yz planes and results about 255 (105) meV per formula unit more stable with DFT+U+V (GGA). At the same time the formation energy of the xz structure thus amounts to 58 (-42) meV per formula unit with DFT+U+V (GGA), which is of the same order of magnitude of the analogous structure of the Fe olivine. The rearrange- ment of the crystal structure is, however, more pro- nounced than in the case of the Fe olivine, consistently with the fact that the Mn3+ ions are Jahn-Teller ac- tive and typically induce more pronounced distortions to the octahedral oxygen cages around them.

Figure 6 compares the unit cells of Li0.5MnPO4 with Li ions on alternate yz [Figs. 6(a) and 6(c)] and xz planes [[Figs. 6(b) and 6(d)]. Consistently with the case of LFPO these cells will be referred to as yz and xz cells. As can be seen already from a visual comparison between Fig. 6(a) and 6(b), the xz cell regularizes its shape and al- most completely recovers an orthorhombic symmetry. In fact, its equilibrium lattice parameters (bohrs) and angles (degrees) are: a = 19.20, b = 11.59, c = 9.15, α = β = 90.0, and γ = 90.36. At the same time, when Li atoms fully occupy alternate xz planes, the system undergoes a signiﬁcant distortion of its inter- nal coordinates. A particularly relevant aspect of this distortion is the fact that Li cations loose their align- ment along the [010] crystalline direction and conﬁg- ure themselves in a zig-zag pattern (with more com- plicated arrangements possibly emerging from bigger supercells of larger extension along b). This fact is quite evident from ﬁgures 6(c) and 6(d) that, in fact, oﬀer a view of the unit cell normal to the xz planes (i.e., along the [010] direction). Based on the con- solidated idea that Li motion takes place along the [010] direction in olivine phosphates [142, 180], the ob- servation above could provide an important element to explain the low ionic conductivity of the Mn com- pound (especially in comparison with the Fe olivine). In fact, the diﬀusion of Li ions during the charge and discharge transients moves the interface between the x = 1 and x = 0 regions of the cathode.

If a x = 0.5 phase is stabilized at this interface (e.g., by a reduc- tion of the interfacial stress between the two phases), Li ions have to diﬀuse through the half-lithiated crys- tal. While the xz half-lithiated structure would be favored by its lower formation energy and a higher degree of structural compatibility with the x = 0, 1 crystals (both orthorhombic), the zig-zag ordering of the Li ions and, in general, a more distorted internal structure, could substantially impair the diﬀusion of these ions along the preferred [010] direction and thus compromise the ionic conductivity of the electrode or the capability of the boundary to move. The structural rearrangement that is observed be- tween the two Li conﬁgurations also reﬂects a diﬀerent distribution of valence electrons (a diﬀerent spatial conﬁguration of 2+ and 3+ Mn cations). However, as in the case of the Fe olivine, the Mn ions that re- sult closer to the Li atoms consistently assume a 2+ state, while the others result in a 3+ state. Their to- tal d states occupations, approximately equal to 5.21 and 4.97 are, again, consistent with those of the yz conﬁguration for Mn ions in corresponding oxidation states and shown in Tables VII and ?? for DFT+U+V and DFT+U+V1×2×2 (5.22/4.99 and 5.21/4.98, re- spectively). The values of the (self-consistent) Hub- bard U obtained for the Mn 2+ and 3+ species are, respectively, 4.71 and 6.70 eV, in quite good agree- ment with the ones computed for the yz structure and presented in Tables V and ??. The values of the Hub- bard V (0.42 - 1.35 and 0.28 - 1.03 eV, respectively) show instead a much looser resemblance with those in the same tables, probably due to diﬀerence in the lo- cal crystal structure around Mn ions", "page": 17, "position": 2}

V. SUMMARY In this work we have used an extended formula- tion of DFT+U, named DFT+U+V [107], to per- form ﬁrst-principles calculations on two important transition-metal olivine phosphates, LixFePO4 and LixMnPO4, that are studied as materials for cath- odes of Li-ion batteries. The new computational tool employed in these calculations is characterized by a corrective functional based on an extended Hubbard Hamiltonian that contains both on-site (U) and inter- site (V ) eﬀective interactions. These electronic inter- action parameters, computed for all the TM species (crystallographic site, magnetic and oxidation state) present, are calculated from ﬁrst-principles using linear-response theory [78] and, through a recursive self-consistent procedure, are obtained in full consis- tency with both the electronic and crystal structures. Computing the energetics of the above-mentioned ma- terials at various Li contents and evaluating key quan- tities to assess their performance as the average volt- age, this work develops a thorough comparison be- tween the results obtained from DFT+U+V, and those of standard DFT functionals, such as PBEsol, or on-site only Hubbard corrections (DFT+U), using either an eﬀective Hubbard U computed for each Li concentration, or averaged over the entire chemical composition range, as often done in literature. The comparative analysis is completed by contrasting the computed quantities with experimental data, when available. The results demonstrate that i) material- and site- speciﬁc interaction parameters can be used conﬁdently (provided they are evaluated self-consistently) in en- ergy comparisons without any need of averaging over composition ranges; ii) the addition of the inter-site interaction (V ) to the corrective Hubbard functionals improves signiﬁcantly the accuracy of the approach and extends considerably the range of electronic lo- calization", "page": 18, "position": 0}

For LixFePO4, the more ionic of the two systems, the improvement that this extension brings is mostly quantitative: it corrects the width of the band gap of the material, reﬁnes the equilibrium crystal struc- ture and, most notably, improves the value of the av- erage voltages, delivering all these quantities in bet- ter agreement with available experimental data. For LixMnPO4, the inclusion of the inter-site coupling leads also to a qualitative improvement on the results of simpler approximations. In fact, this material fea- tures a more pronounced hybridization between the transition metal ions and their nearest neighbor oxy- gens and a Hubbard corrective functional with on- site only interactions (i.e. DFT+U) is not capable to capture electronic localization (e.g., on the Mn2+ ions at x = 0.5) and overcorrects important quan- tities such as the average voltage. The inclusion of the inter-site interaction V leads to a more reﬁned description of hybridized states that captures charge disproportionation at intermediate Li content (i.e., a clear distinction of Mn ions in 2+ and 3+ with oc- cupations separately similar to those of lithiated and delithiated materials), reﬁnes the equilibrium crystal structure and the agreement with the lattice parame- ters measured in experiments (albeit not uniformly for all compositions), and improves the prediction of the average voltage vs Li/Li+. The use of the extended Hubbard functional also allows to capture a signiﬁcant reorganization of the internal structure of the crystal upon changing Li conﬁguration at intermediate com- positions (probably a consequence of the Jahn-Teller activity of Mn3+ ions) that suggests a stronger bind- ing than in the Fe olivine between Li+ and incom- ing electrons and higher", "page": 18, "position": 1}

To further test the predictivity of the extended DFT+U+V functional we have also performed calculations on the mixed Fe-Mn olivine phosphate LixMnyFe1−yPO4 (see Ref. [105] for a useful review on this system). Preliminary cal- culations (whose results will be published elsewhere) on this system have shown that DFT+U+V is also able to capture charge disproportionation in presence of multiple transition-metal species with occupations that are consistent with those shown in this paper for both Fe and Mn in all the oxidation states ex- plored. In addition it correctly predicts Mn3+ ions in the delithiated compound to be the ﬁrst to reduce upon Li intercalation. From a methodological point of view the accu- racy and predictivity that the extended DFT+U+V functional achieves with a consistent calculation of the Hubbard parameters is quite remarkable, espe- cially in comparison with the very abundant literature where the simpler on-site only DFT+U is used with a semiempirical tuning of the interaction parameters on the properties of interest. Notwithstanding the fact that the semiempirical evaluation of interaction pa- rameters is impossible without reference (e.g., exper- imental results to ﬁt) and is far less viable with more advanced functionals (e.g., including several kinds of interactions) or when multiple Hubbard species (or oxidation states) are present, it should be also kept in mind that within DFT+U it is often impossible to identify a single set of Hubbard parameters able to improve the prediction of all the properties of a system [88–90]. In other words if a value of U is needed to reproduce the equilibrium crystal structure, the one(s) necessary to improve for example the pre- diction of", "page": 18, "position": 2}

The recent automation of the LRT evaluation of the Hubbard parameters through DFPT [109], reduc- ing signiﬁcantly its computational cost and improving its robustness, user-friendliness and accuracy is thus making self-consistent DFT+U+V emerge as a pre- dictive, versatile and eﬃcient tool for the accurate modeling of a broad variety of materials (especially when their functionality is related to electronic local- ization) and for the discovery and optimization of new ones through large-scale high-throughput ab initio cal- culations.

Specif- ically, we present DFT+U+V calculations performed with a ﬁnite Hubbard U on the p states of oxygen ions (named DFT+Udp+V); with the Hubbard parame- ters computed in a larger 1 × 2 × 2 supercell (named DFT+U+V1×2×2) and from a DFPT implementa- tion of LRT [1] (for both DFT+U and DFT+U+V, named DFT+UDF P T and DFT+U+VDF P T , respec- tively). Designed to give equivalent results to the supercell, real-space approach introduced in Ref. [2], the DFPT implementation exploits momentum- speciﬁc (monochromatic) perturbations, which al- lows to greatly reduce the computational costs, to improve the scaling of the calculations, the con- trol on convergence, the accuracy of ﬁnal results, the user-friendliness and automation, thus making self-consistent DFT+U and DFT+U+V calculations very straightforward and suitable for high-throughput studies. For the materials studied in this work, iso- lated perturbations were reconstructed as summa- tions over monochromatic perturbations on a regu- lar 1×2×2 q-point grid of the Brillouin zone, equiva- lent to the 1×2×2 supercell mentioned above. DFPT- based calculations were performed with perturbations on Fe 3d and O 2p states for the DFT+U+V case and on Fe 3d states only for the DFT+U case. In all the four approaches considered in this section the Hubbard parameters are computed in full con- sistency with both the electronic and crystal struc- tures, as explained in the main text.

In comparison with the results shown in Table ?? of the main paper, the addition of U on oxygen p states always leads to a contraction of the lattice with re- spect to the closest DFT+U+V approximation, which seems to worsen the agreement with the experimen- tal data for LiFePO4 and only slightly improve it for FePO4. This observation is somewhat in contradiction with the results of some literature where an Hubbard correction on the p states of oxygen ligands is found to reﬁne the bonding structure (and bond lengths) [3] or electronic properties [4]. However, these re- sults were obtained with simple Hubbard functionals that did not include inter-site interactions. We in- terpret our ﬁndings as highlighting how the physics to be corrected is that of 3d self-interaction and of Fe 3d de-hybridization with O 2p in DFT+U, rather than the self-interaction of 2p electrons. It is inter- esting to note that, as mentioned earlier, while us- ing a larger (1×2×2) cell in the calculation of U and V ’s results in values for these quantities quite dif- ferent from those obtained from smaller unit cells, the equilibrium lattice parameters predicted are al- most identical and overall in equally good agreement with experimental values, suggesting a scarce sensi- tivity of the crystal structure to small variations of the Hubbard parameters.

On the other hand, in spite of the signiﬁcant diﬀerences between the interaction pa- rameters U and V of the corresponding Fe ions, espe- cially high for LiFePO4 and Li0.5FePO4 (up to 0.6 eV for the U), DFT+U+V1×2×2 predicts occupations for the Fe ions in the three cases that are almost identi- cal to those obtained with the DFT+U+V (shown in Table ??) and the equilibrium crystal structures are basically undistinguishable, as discussed earlier. How- ever, the average voltage shows some dependence on the values of the eﬀective interactions, and the one computed from DFT+U+V1×2×2 calculations is 0.15 V higher, in slightly worse agreement with experimen- tal results. As for calculations relying on DFPT for the evaluation of Hubbard parameters, it is easy to check the substantial equivalence with the homolo- gous results shown in Table ?? of the main paper.

Figure S.1 shows the projected density of states of LiFePO4 obtained within DFT+U+V1×2×2. From the comparison with Fig. ?? of the main paper it is ev- ident that the diﬀerence with the DFT+U+V DOS is merely quantitative with DFT+U+V1×2×2 resulting in a smaller band gap (3.6 eV), actually closer to the experimental value (≈3.7 eV). This observation is ac- tually important from a methodological point of view: while converging (e.g., with the size of the supercell) the value of the eﬀective electronic interaction param- eters used in the corrective functional is obviously im- portant to capture quantities that are related to vari- ous features of the KS spectrum, other properties that can be computed from total energy diﬀerences seem more robust with respect to the value of the eﬀective interactions and show a faster convergence with size. However, this is only true for DFT+U+V, probably due to a sort of compensation between the variation of V and that of U. B.

Based on the results obtained for LFPO self-consistent calculations of U’s and V ’s were not performed within DFT+Udp+V or within DFT+U+VDF P T for the half lithiated material (due to higher structural freedom and lower symmetry, calculations for this speciﬁc sys- tem are typically more expensive and harder to con- verge). This omission only precludes the possibility to determine for this functional the formation energy for x = 0.5 and to evaluate the occupation of the two classes of Mn ions in comparison with the end- members of the family; the average voltage, instead, depending only on the comparison between the x = 0 and x = 1 materials, can be easily evaluated and will be discussed later. The diﬀerence between the val- ues obtained with DFT+Udp+V and those reported in Table ?? (especially for DFT+U+V, the closest approximation) seems to indicate an important role of oxygen p states in the screening of the eﬀective interactions; at the same time the comparison be- tween DFT+U+V1×2×2 and DFT+U+V suggests a relatively slow convergence of the Hubbard parame- ters with the size of the supercell used in their calcu- lation.

This observation further con- ﬁrm the diﬃculty in controlling the numerical conver- gence of ﬁnite diﬀerence calculations performed in big supercell and the advantages of the DFPT implemen- tation. While these considerations on the numerical values of the Hubbard parameters are practically use- ful, it is important to remark that i) they contain the eﬀects of structural optimization, which is part of the self-consistent procedure; ii) a more meaningful and important comparison is to be developed on the re- sults obtained from calculations performed within the various functionals. This analysis will be expanded in the reminder of this section. Table S.V shows the equilibrium lattice pa- rameters in dependence of composition for DFT+Udp+V, DFT+U+V1×2×2, DFT+UDF P T and DFT+U+VDF P T . These results are to be compared with those in Table ?? of the main paper. As in the case of LFPO, it is worth noting that, in spite of the diﬀerences between the values of U’s and V ’s computed in the single or 1×2×2 supercell, the equilibrium lattice parameters predicted in the two cases are practically coincident for all three Li concentrations. With DFT+U+V1×2×2 however the angles between the unit cell vectors of Li0.5MnPO4 are slightly closer to 90◦than with DFT+U+V. The addition of a ﬁnite Hubbard U on the p state of oxygen through DFT+Udp+V contracts the lattice parameter for x = 1 (resulting in an agreement with experimental data of the same quality of DFT+U+V) but predicts a lattice for the x = 0 crystal signif- icantly expanded with respect to the experimental structure.

From the comparison with the results shown in Ta- ble ?? of the main paper it is easy to notice that the use of a Hubbard U on oxygen p states deteri- orates the agreement of the predicted average volt- age with respect to the experimental value. Con- versely, in spite of the signiﬁcant diﬀerence in the computed values of U and V , DFT+U+V1×2×2 pre- dicts an average voltage vs Li/Li+ that is only slightly larger than the DFT+U+V result (4.26 V instead of 4.15 V), still representing a good approximation of the experimental value. Consistently with bet- ter equilibrium structure for x = 0 and x = 1, DFT+UDF P T improves the predicted average volt- age with respect to the corresponding result of Ta- ble ?? in the main paper. However no progress is recorded in capturing charge disproportionation for the x = 0.5 composition. Actually, the signiﬁcant increase in the (positive) formation energy for this material suggests that the self-consistent procedure has probably incurred in a local minimum, with a signiﬁcantly expanded structure. DFT+U+VDF P T predicts atomic occupations in agreement with pre- vious DFT+U+V and DFT+U+V1×2×2 results; the average voltage it gives, 4.21 V, is actually in better agreement with DFT+U+V and experimental results than DFT+U+V1×2×2.
