The high electrical conductivity and mechanical strengths of MXenes make them a suitable candidate to provide adequate anchoring to prevent polyselenides dissolution and improved electrochemical performance. Herein, we used density functional theory (DFT) calculations to understand the binding mechanism of Li2Sen on graphene and surface functionalized Ti3C2 MXenes. We used graphene as reference material to assess Li2Sen binding strengths on functionalized Ti3C2X2 (where X = S, O, F, and Cl). We observed that Ti3C2S2 and Ti3C2O2 exhibit superior anchoring behavior compared to graphene, Ti3C2F2, and Ti3C2Cl2. The calculated Li2Sen adsorption strength provided by S and O terminated Ti3C2 are stronger than the commonly used ether-based electrolyte, which is a requisite for effective suppression of the Li2Sen shuttling. The adsorbed Li2Sen on Ti3C2X2 and graphene retains their structural integrity without a chemical decomposition. The density of states (DOS) analysis exhibits that the conductive behavior of the Ti3C2X2 is preserved even after Li2Sen adsorption, which can stimulate the electrochemical activity of involved Li2Sen chemistry. Based on our unprecedented results, Ti3C2S2 and Ti3C2O2 are found to exhibit superior anchoring behavior for Li2Sen adsorption, which can be leveraged for designing effective selenium-based cathode materials to boost the electrochemical performance of the Li-Se battery system. 1.

The implementation of the rechargeable batteries in EVs requires high energy density, longer cycle life, lower cost, and higher efficiency.1 The wide abundance and astounding energy density of chalcogen group elements such as O, S, and Se make them suitable candidates for future energy storage applications. However, owing to the electrolyte decomposition and the need for excess Li in the anode, the commercialization of the Li-O2 batteries are far apart from reality.2 However, rechargeable lithium sulfur (Li-S) batteries can serve the purpose because of its high theoretical energy density (2600 W h kg- 1) and capacity (1673 mA h g-1) values approximately five times higher when compared to the commercial LIBs, and they are cost effective, widely abundant, and low in toxicity.3,4 However, practical realization of Li-S batteries is thwarted due to various challenges such as the dissolution of intermediate polysulfides into the electrolytes, commonly known as shuttle effect, and the less utilization of the active materials due to the formation of insoluble polysulfides.3,5 Although strategies such as introducing conductive porous matrices,6 additives,7 and usage of suitable electrolytes8 has been established into the Li-S batteries; the practical applications is still restricted which warrant the search of other substitutes for Li-S battery cathode materials to deliver high energy density and specific capacity and meet the requirements of the next generation energy landscape. Rechargeable lithium selenium (Li-Se) batteries are analogous to Li-S counterpart in terms of chemical properties as the selenium reacts with the lithium ions to form lithium polyselenides (Li2Sen). Although the gravimetric capacity of Se (678 mA h g-1) is lesser when compared to the S (1672 mA h g-1), but its higher volumetric capacity (3253 mA h cm-3) is comparable to S (3467 mA h cm-3).9,10 Moreover, the electronic conductivity of Se (1x 10 -3 S/m) is at least twenty orders of magnitude higher than the S (5 x 10-28 S/m) that triggers better electrochemical activities of Se.8 The Li-Se batteries is a prospective candidate to meet the requirements of the higher volumetric", "page": 0, "position": 1}

The stable capacity of 415 mA h g-1 at 0.2 C for 100 cycles was realized through homogeneously distributed Se on polypyrole carbonized and KOH activated interconnected porous carbon nanofibers.22 The CoSe2-porous carbon composites,12 graphene- selenium hybrid microballs,23 hollow double-shell Se@CNx nanobelts,11 and Ag2Se coating onto the Se encapsulates, and various metal organic frameworks are reported to alleviate but not to entirely eliminate the dissolution of polyselenides as required to achieve the target performance of Li-Se batteries. The Se incorporated into the 3D interconnected porous carbon nanofibers are investigated as possible means to suppress the active material dissolution via the uniform Se distribution onto confined mesopores, which readily acts as a cushion for volume expansion and enhances the electrochemical performance.24 Moreover, the polyselenides migration can be suppressed by constraining Se into microporous N-doped carbon.25 The hierarchical architecture developed by the fusion of graphene and 3D porous carbon nanoparticles are probed to improve the electric and ionic conductivities and suppress the dissolution of polyselenides.26 He at al.27 introduced 3D graphene - CNT/Se cathode and found that the conductive network provided organized channels for the Li diffusion and electron transfer and further the hierarchical structure prevented the polyselenides dissolution into", "page": 1, "position": 0}

Although selenium confinement onto the carbon matrix could reduce the migration, the optimization of the micropore size in carbon structure is a challenging task. As the pore size of the carbon matrix depends on the overall architecture, the minimal size could originate difficulties in accommodating the electroactive material (Se) and diffusion of Li ions.28 Since the larger micropores could promote the dissolution of Se upon charging and drastically affect the electrochemical performance,13 which in turn prompts further research efforts to investigate alternate anchoring materials (AMs) for the Li-Se system. Researchers have sought various novel materials and strategies to address the polyselenides shuttling during the charge/discharge process. Recently, MXenes, a class of 2-D materials, grabbed special attention because of its multiple attractive features such as high electronic conductivity, high surface area, and catalytically active sites for facilitating the Li2Sen conversion reactions.29 However, the bare MXenes cannot be directly used in the chalcogenides system due to the high reactivity of polychalcogenides towards transition metals that causes chemical decomposition of polychalcogenides.30,31 Thus, surface functionalization are required, and commonly chalcogenides and halogens groups are employed.30,31,32–35 MXenes have exhibited promising performances in Li-S batteries. Wang et al.36 studied the shuttling effect of polysulfides in Li-S batteries using density functional theory (DFT) calculations with the anchoring materials such as bare V2C, V2CO2, and V2CS2 and reported that the sulfur functionalized MXenes exhibits adequate thermal and chemical stability and polysulfides binding strength.

This observation motivates us to incorporate four disparate surface functionalization and extensively examine their role on the underlying characteristics and the mechanisms of polyselenides anchoring on MXenes as host materials for the cathodes of Li-Se batteries. 2. Calculation methods All the first-principles calculations were executed using the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP).37 We used Projector Augmented Wave (PAW) pseudopotential to investigate the electron- ion interaction and Perdew-Bruke-Ernzerhof (PBE) functional with the Generalized Gradient Approximations (GGA) to describe the electron-electron exchange correlations.38 The kinetic energy cut off was selected as 520 eV for the plane wave basis calculations. A vacuum space of 30 Å was added to avoid the interactions across the periodic boundary. We accounted for van der Waal interactions using the DFT-D3 method to provide better accuracy in evaluating the binding strength of polyselenides with the MXenes.39,40 The conjugate gradient method was employed for geometry optimization, and the convergence thresholds of energy and force are fixed to be 10-4 eV and 0.025 eV/Å, respectively.

Results and discussion Li2Sen Structures. The underlying chemistry in Li-Se and Li-S batteries are quite analogous. During the discharge process, the lithium ions released from the anode reacts with the Se cathode to generate intermediate polyselenides leading to the final discharge products such as Li2Se2 and Li2Se. The most stable structures of Li2Sen are obtained via relaxation simulations, and the optimized Li2Sen structures are shown in Figure 1. The observed three- dimensional geometries of Li2Sen molecules arises due to the tendency of the Li+ cations to chemically bond with electron rich terminal Se atoms. The puckered ring structured Se8 possess D4d symmetry and the shortest Se-Se bond length is 2.353 Å. The higher ordered soluble polyselenides such as Li2Se8, Li2Se6, and Li2Se4 exhibit C2 symmetry with the minimum Li-Se bond distances of 2.542, 2.581, and 2.524 Å, respectively. The insoluble Li2Se2 and Li2Se exhibit C2v symmetry and the corresponding shortest bond lengths are 2.387 and 2.238 Å. We observe a decreasing trend in the Li-Se bond lengths from higher to lower order polyselenides, and the behavior can be ascribed to the stronger Li-Se covalent interactions. Figure 1.

The Li2Sen molecules were allowed to adsorb on the graphene by placing the two Li atoms on top of C atoms.

The calculated binding energies are presented in Figure 2, which compares well with other works.43 The configurations of energetically the most favored graphene-Li2Sen systems are displayed in Figure S2. From the figure, we could observe that the cyclooctaselenium (Se8) molecule is orientated parallel to the graphene sheet with a minimum bond distance of 3.474 Å. We observe an increase in the Li-C bond length with the increasing Se concentration in the Li2Sen. The Li-C interactions retain the structural conformation of Li2Sen; however, a slight change in the average intramolecular Li-Se bond lengths are observed which are presented in Table 1. Overall, the calculated binding energies for all Li2Sen are found to be below 0.80 eV, such weaker interactions between the Li2Sen and graphene is indicative to the inefficient containment of the Li2Sen within the cathode materials.

The ineffectiveness of apolar carbon materials in preventing Li2Sen shuttling entails the search for alternative AMs. MXenes are promising candidates to provide the required anchoring effect that can possibly stem from their polar characteristics.

The binding energy values for bare Ti3C2 adsorbed Li2Sen are 28.72 eV for Se8, 22.61 eV for Li2Se8, 11.19 eV for Li2Se6, 10.91 eV for Li2Se4, 8.23 eV for Li2Se2 and 5.49 eV for Li2Se and the optimized configurations are displayed in Figure S3. It is noted that the adsorption energy decreases while the Se count in the Li2Sen decreases. The values indicate a strong chemical interaction between Li2Sen and surface Ti atoms. Ostensibly, the derived absorption energies are sufficient to bind the polyselenides to prevent their dissolution into the electrolytes, however, the stronger binding results in the chemical decomposition of the intermediate polyselenides which in turn hinders reversibility of the Se cathodes. Additionally, the strong Ti-Se bonds can be readily formed during the preparation of Ti3C2/Se composites or in the course of electrochemical cycling of the Se-cathodes. The decompositions of Li2Sen found during the adsorption precludes the use of bare Ti3C2 in selenium cathodes as AMs. Thus, in order to improve the polyselenides binding behavior with Ti3C2 and for improved performance of the battery, it is essential to implement surface modifications in the Ti3C2.

For both Ti3C2O2 and Ti3C2S2, the Se8 exhibits the lowest binding energy. Similarly, the adsorption energies for Ti3C2F2 and Ti3C2Cl2 are calculated from the optimized geometric configurations (Figure S6 and S7) and displayed in Figure 2. However, the adsorption energy values of Se8 are found to be larger when compared to other higher order polyselenides indicating weaker Li2Sen adsorption behavior that could result in ineffective anchoring. With the lithiation, both the class of materials exhibit a decrease in the adsorption energy values for Li2Se6, and the value increases as the lithiation further proceeds.

Therefore, it can be concluded that the higher thermodynamic stability of Li2Sen  4 adsorbed on Ti3C2S2 and Ti3C2O2 structures can effectively constrain the higher order polyselenides from the dissolution into the electrolytes. Next, we analyze the geometric features of the Li2Sen adsorbed AMs. From Table 1, one can see that for all the cases of graphene and Ti3C2X2, the largest distance between the AMs and adsorbate are found for the Se8, and Figure 3 and S4-7 shows no structural deformation of the molecular. In the cases of Li2Sen, the Li atoms are found closer to the AMs than the Se atoms, and the shortest distance between the Li in Li2Sen and the surfaces increases with the increasing count of the Se atoms, and this is predominantly because of the electronegative nature of Se and stronger chemical interactions. The trend of stronger Li2Sen and AMs interactions with the decreasing Se count is correlated with the weakening of the intermolecular Li-Se bond strengths, which is evident from the increasing Li-Se bond lengths in Li2Sen. Finally, observing the polyselenides adsorption energies of various functionalized Ti3C2X2, we conclude that both S and O functionalization results in superior anchoring behavior compared to F and Cl functionalization and graphene. The moderate polyselenides binding energies of O and S functionalization can be deemed as adequate for the containment of Li2Sen within the Se-cathode material without chemical decompositions.

The ratio of vdW interaction for graphene and various AMs are shown in Figure 4. From the figure, we could observe that for all the AMs, the ratio of vdW interaction is nearly 100 % in the case of Se8, which clearly demonstrates that the Se8 interactions with the AMs are predominantly via non-bonded vdW. However, as the lithiation process continues, the ratio of vdW drops off, and the trend is found the opposite to the binding energy values. The interaction of Li atoms with the AMs results in stronger chemical interactions, which is evident from the reduction of the vdW ratio, and the highest chemical interactions are found in the Li2Se cases. For Ti3C2S2 and Ti3C2O2, we observe a systematic decrease in the vdW interactions with lithiation, however, in cases of Ti3C2F2 and Ti3C2Cl2, the ratio of vdW is greater than 50 percent except for Ti3C2F2 – Li2Se, which indicates that the lithiation process is dominated by the vdW interaction and these values are well consistent with other work.29 Figure 5.

However, in the case of graphene, the charge transfer values are very minimal, indicating the weaker adsorption of the Li2Sen on the surface because of the apolar characteristics of graphene. All the materials depict a similar trend in the charge transfer values, that is, the values increase from higher to lower order polyselenides except Li2Se6 species. The lower charge transfer value of Li2Se6 is correlated with the lower adsorption energies. We observe that the amount of charge transfer in Ti3C2S2 and Ti3C2O2 are greater when compared to F and Cl functionalization and graphene, which demonstrates stronger chemical interactions of Li2Sen with S and O terminated surfaces. However, the lower charge transfer values for F and Cl cases can be attributed to the weaker chemical interaction between the Li2Sen and the AMs. The calculated charge transfer values for Ti3C2S2 adsorbed structures are 0.274 |e| for Se8, 0.864 |e| for Li2Se8, 0.949 |e| for Li2Se6, 0.840 |e| for Li2Se4, 0.980 |e| for Li2Se2 and 1.110 |e| for Li2Se. For Ti3C2O2, the values are 0.159 |e| for Se8, 1.031 |e| for Li2Se8, 0.967 |e| for Li2Se6, 1.027 |e| for Li2Se4, 0.998 |e| for Li2Se2 and 0.949 |e| for Li2Se, respectively. The positive values for the charge transfer values observed in all the Ti3C2X2 materials indicate that the charge is transferred from the Li2Sen species to the Ti3C2X2. The results illustrate that the charge transfer value of Se8 is the lowest for all the functionalized groups when compared to other Li2Sen. The softening of the adsorbed intramolecular Li-Se bonds can be explained by considering the charge transfer process from the polyselenides to the Ti3C2X2. The electrons are bereaved from the Li2Sen as they are absorbed on the Ti3C2X2. The higher electron deficiency in the Li2Sen at the adsorbed state—results in enhanced chemical interactions of Li with the AMs—causes larger elongation of Li-Se bonds in Li2Sen. The charge transfer is primarily contributed from the Li atom to the AMs because of the", "page": 6, "position": 1}

The iso-surface level is set at 0.0020 e Å-3. The green and red colors denote charge accumulation and depletion, respectively. Density of States (DOS). We further studied the bonding characteristics between the Li2Sen and the Ti3C2X2 by examining the electronic structures of the adsorbed systems. We calculated the total and projected DOS (PDOS) to probe the conductive behavior of the Ti3C2X2. The total DOS of pristine Ti3C2X2, Li2Se, Li2Se4, and Li2Se8 adsorbed on Ti3C2X2 systems (Fig S10-14) were performed as representative cases of higher, medium, and lower order polyselenides to understand the change in electronic structure due to the charge transfer from the Li2Sen to the functionalized MXenes before and after the adsorption. However, in all Li2Sen cases, there is no significant change in the DOS for all the functional groups regardless of the Li2Sen adsorption. From the figure S10-S14, we could observe that, compared to the pristine AMs, the Li2Sen adsorbed systems results in negligible changes in the electronic structures as such electronic conductivity of the AMs are retained even after the Li2Sen adsorption. The electronic conductive properties facilitate electron transfer directly to the involved redox reactions of Li2Sen intermediates. In order to further investigate the influence of Li2Sen on the Ti3C2X2, projected PDOS was analyzed for both pristine and adsorbed systems of Ti3C2S2 and Ti3C2O2 and displayed in Figure 7. From the figure, we could observe that compared to pristine AMs, a considerable amount of electron states crosses the Fermi level in the case of Li2Sen adsorbed on Ti3C2S2 and Ti3C2O2 indicates that the host materials could effectively circumvent the insulating behavior of Se8. Moreover, the metallic behavior of Li2Sen adsorbed Ti3C2S2 and Ti3C2O2 is maintained due to the abundance of electronic states in the fermi energy level stemming from the 3d state of Ti. Moreover, a strong or partial polar covalent bond is formed from the hybridization of the Ti-3d and 2p/3p of S/O, resulting in Ti-S/O bonds.

Conclusion In summary, we employed the DFT calculations to demonstrate the functionality of graphene and Ti3C2 MXenes as host materials for Se-cathodes. We elucidate the mechanistic details of the inadequate polyselenides (Li2Sen) binding energies on graphene and strategies to improve the Li2Sen retention capability within the Se- cathode using a new class of materials, Ti3C2 MXenes. The calculated weak adsorption energies resulted from Li2Sen binding on graphene clearly indicate the graphene is incapable of providing requisite anchoring to prevent polyselenides from dissolution. Furthermore, we found that the bare Ti3C2 cannot be used as AM because of the stronger binding and subsequent dissociations of the polyselenides on the surface, which can debilitate the reversibility of the battery. We leveraged the modified Ti3C2 surfaces with various functional groups to overcome the limitations of bare Ti3C2. We identified Ti3C2S2 and Ti3C2O2 as AMs with superior performance, to provide adequate binding to Li2Sen without chemical decomposition, compared to graphene and other functionalized MXenes. We consider the S- and", "page": 7, "position": 1}

The computed higher binding energies of polyselenides with Ti3C2S2 and Ti3C2O2 than the commonly used ether-based electrolyte solvents are indicative to the effectiveness to suppress the Li2Sen migration. From the ratio of vdW analysis, we observed that the chemical interaction primarily originated from the intercalated Li+ ions, and the van der Waal interactions were contributed by S. From the charge transfer analysis, we found that the charge is transferred from the Li2Sen structure to the Ti3C2X2. The density of states of Ti3C2X2 reveals that the metallic properties of all the materials are retained even after adsorption with the polyselenides which is beneficial to promote the electrochemical process. Overall, the S- and O- functionalized Ti3C2 can be used to achieve two-fold objectives of (i) improving performance for polyselenides anchoring and (ii) facilitating the electronic conduction path to overcome the limitations of the insulating nature of Se as well as to eliminate the use of carbons. Thus, the utilization of the Ti3C2S2 and Ti3C2O2 MXenes in Se-based cathodes can be deemed as a sizeable step forward towards designing electrochemically inert carbon-free high-performance Se-cathode materials.
