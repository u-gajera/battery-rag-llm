While Density Functional Theory (DFT) is widely used, its inherent approximations limit its ability to capture strong correlation effects, particularly in surface reactions. Quantum computing offers a promising alternative, especially for localized electron inter- actions. In this work, we apply a quantum embedding approach to study the Oxygen Reduction Reaction at Lithium battery electrode surfaces.

Keywords: Materials Science, Quantum Computing, Quantum Chemistry, Quantum Embedding Introduction Computational modeling of correlated electronic systems is essential for accurately predicting chemical and material properties. However, the exact solution of the elec- tronic Schr¨odinger equation is computationally prohibitive, forcing the adoption of approximate methods. Although Density Functional Theory (DFT) is widely used, its exchange-correlation approximations struggle to capture strong electron-electron correlations in complex systems [1, 2]. Hybrid quantum-classical approaches, sometimes termed Quantum-centric Super- computing [3], offer an alternative by leveraging quantum algorithms—such as Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE)—that, in principle, simulate electronic wavefunc- tions more efficiently than classical methods.[4–6] Due to current quantum hardware limitations, present approaches integrate quantum techniques with classical simu- lations. A critical aspect of these methods is active space selection, which reduces the computational burden while preserving key electronic correlations. Techniques like Density Difference Analysis (DDA), often refined with coupled-cluster natural orbitals [7], Atomic Valence Active Space (AVAS) [8], that creates an active space from a targeted set of atomic valence orbitals, and Density Matrix Embedding The- ory (DMET)[9] which partitions the system into correlated fragments to attempt to capture electron correlation effects serve this purpose. Traditional methods like the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE)[10–12] have been explored for computing ground state energies, yet challenges related to ansatz design, barren plateaus, and high sampling overhead limit their scalability [13–16]. As a result, alternative approaches such as Sample-Based Quantum Diagonaliza- tion (SQD), a method that efficiently projects the electronic Hamiltonian onto a reduced subspace constructed from a sampled set of electronic configurations [17] and its enhanced version, Extended SQD (Ext-SQD), which", "page": 1, "position": 0}

To construct the reduced subspace for SQD and Ext-SQD, electronic configurations must be efficiently sampled from quantum hardware using an ansatz that balances physical accuracy with near-term feasibility. The Local Unitary Cluster Jastrow (LUCJ) ansatz achieves this by minimizing gate depth while preserving key correla- tion effects, and initializing circuits with classical coupled-cluster parameters further enhances configuration relevance [19]. Recent studies demonstrate that employing such ans¨atze on modern quantum processors enables accurate ground and excited state energy calculations under realistic conditions, paving the way for quantum-assisted electronic structure methods that surpass conventional classical approaches [17–20]. This integration with current quantum computing infrastructure highlights the appli- cability of these frameworks in real-world quantum simulations and paves the way for further improvements in quantum-assisted electronic structure calculations. In this work, we leverage advanced hybrid quantum-classical methods designed for studying molecular reactions on surfaces relevant to battery materials, demonstrating that our hybrid quantum-classical framework achieves accurate ground-state energy calculations while remaining computationally efficient. We employ an active space selection method based on DDA [7] to identify the electronic orbitals most relevant for describing the reaction, we then build a LUCJ ansatz [19] within the active space and sample the most relevant configurations from this circuit on the ibm torino processor. Afterwards we utilize SQD[17, 21] and Ext-SQD[18] to accurately compute reaction energy values. Our results highlight the potential of integrating quantum computing with clas- sical embedding techniques for advancing materials discovery and reaction modeling. By systematically selecting active spaces and leveraging sample-based diagonalization methods, we provide a scalable and effective approach for simulating complex chemi- cal systems. In particular, we demonstrate that incorporating excitation operators in Ext-SQD significantly enhances the quality of sampled configuration spaces compared to standard SQD, leading to improved accuracy in representing ground state wave- functions without entirely sacrificing computational efficiency. Finally, we discuss the broader implications of our work and propose directions for future research to further refine and scale quantum-assisted simulations in chemical and materials science.

However, depending on local conditions such as oxygen concentration and electrolyte composition, other lithium oxides, including lithium peroxide (Li2O2) and lithium superoxide (LiO2), may also form. The competition between these different reaction pathways is a critical factor influencing battery performance and longevity. [23, 24] Previous studies have proposed reaction mechanisms for various surface-mediated electrochemical processes.[25, 26] Following a similar approach, we investigated the formation of Li+ and O2 – species on the surface through quantum chemistry calcula- tions. The reaction of lithium with oxygen involves the dissociation of molecular O2 and the subsequent adsorption of O2 – anions, which interact with Li+ ions to form stable surface-bound lithium oxides. This process can be described by Li + O2 −−→Li+ + O2 −(ads). The adsorption of O2 – plays a critical role in the initial stages of lithium oxide formation. The stabilization of these anions on the surface dictates the pathway for further oxide growth, ultimately influencing the electrochemical performance of the battery. [23, 27, 28] By employing quantum simulations, we aim to capture the detailed electronic structure of these adsorbed species, providing insights into their stability and reactivity in lithium metal anode systems. To study this system, we employed a computational workflow consisting of geom- etry optimization, active space selection, and quantum experiments. The workflow, summarized in Figure 1, enables a systematic investigation of lithium-oxygen interac- tions at the atomic level. The reaction energy was computed as the energy difference ∆E = Eprod −Ereac between the reactant and product states. This energy differ- ence provides insights into the thermodynamics of lithium oxide formation, which is essential for understanding battery stability. Geometry Optimization The geometry optimizations were performed using DFT as implemented in the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP) [29–31].

[34] The electronic structure calculations were restricted to the Γ-point of the supercell, as including additional k-points did not significantly alter the electronic density. The computed reaction energy at the Γ-point, namely ∆E = −3.897 eV is under- estimated against the typical literature values around −6 eV for Lithium oxides. [35–38] Active Space Selection The active space selection process combines multiple techniques to systematically identify the most relevant electronic orbitals for quantum simulations. First, Kohn- Sham orbitals are localized using the Pipek-Mezey method to preserve electronic structure characteristics across the Brillouin zone. This localization helps isolate occu- pied and virtual orbitals that contribute significantly to the reaction under study. Next, DDA is employed to assess charge redistribution by computing the electronic density difference between the reactant and product states. A tunable threshold func- tion is then applied to filter out orbitals with negligible contributions, ensuring a physically meaningful selection of orbitals for the active space. Seven occupied orbitals are chosen for the reactant and eight for the product as well as all virtual orbitals. These choices were based on the valence space of O2 and whether the computed electronic density for the orbitals was in the correct region. To enhance accuracy and convergence, the selected active space is further refined using natural orbitals derived from coupled-cluster singles and doubles (CCSD) cal- culations in the active space previously formed. These orbitals are ranked based on occupation numbers, distinguishing those that are fully occupied, unoccupied, or frac- tionally occupied due to strong electron correlation effects. In our systems, we do not have fractionally occupied orbitals. The new active space is then constructed around the Highest Occupied Natural Orbital (HONO) and the Lowest Unoccupied Natu- ral Orbital (LUNO), with additional orbitals included in an “inside-out” fashion as needed to improve accuracy", "page": 5, "position": 0}

This suggests that an active space of 40 orbitals would be necessary to calculate the energy difference. Due to computational resource limitations, we cannot scale CASCI beyond 14 orbitals but we can see reasonable agreement between the other two methods with errors within a few tens of mHa in this range. It is relevant as well that the error against CASCI increases as we add more orbitals to the active space, which is expected. As CCSD is not a variational method, it is possible that it actually underestimating the actual ground state energies that we have from HCI.

In Figure 5 we can see histograms representing the output of the LUCJ circuit samples for the reactant in the (14e, 20o) active space. Notice that in Figure 5a the Hartree-Fock configuration is the most common, which happens when using a non-truncated one-layer LUCJ ansatz.[17] In Figure 5b we have the results for the truncated two-layer circuit, which leads to a more relevant distribution of configura- tions that is not dominated by the HF state. Therefore, we chose to use the truncated two-layer LUCJ ansatz for the rest of this work. In Table 1 we see circuit sizes and qubit requirements for some of the circuits.

Those, in turn, provide much better results, staying consistently closer to CASCI (below the 1.6 mHa chemical accuracy threshold) when compared to HCI and CCSD, at up to 14 orbitals, as seen in Figure 3a. Ext-SQD also reaches lower energy values for both the product and reactant beyond 14 orbitals.

However, as indicated in Figure 3a, the computational cost associated with Ext-SQD grows significantly as the number of orbitals increases, shifting the bottleneck from quantum resources to classical diagonalization routines. Future work should focus on optimizing classical post-processing techniques, such as parallelizing the diagonalization of extended sub- spaces, to enable simulations with larger active spaces. These optimizations could allows us to scale beyond 30 orbitals up to around 40 orbitals where the bottleneck shifts back to the quantum stack. Another important aspect of our results is the comparison with classical methods. Figure 3 illustrates how Ext-SQD converges to lower energy values compared to CCSD and HCI, at around 20 orbitals. This suggests that quantum methods, when properly integrated with classical solvers, can offer tangible improvements in computational chemistry for materials discovery. Additionally, the energy differences computed with Ext-SQD begin to converge earlier than those from CCSD, reinforcing the advantages of this quantum-classical approach. Despite these advancements, several challenges must be addressed before quantum- assisted simulations become a practical tool for real-world applications. Noise resilience, circuit depth limitations, and efficient state preparation remain key hurdles. The LUCJ ansatz, while effective in reducing circuit depth, may require further modifi- cations to enhance expressivity and error resilience. Additionally, exploring alternative quantum ansatzes, such as adaptive variational circuits, could further improve energy estimations while maintaining hardware efficiency. Looking ahead, the insights gained from this work provide a strong foundation for future research in quantum-assisted simulations of surface reactions. The extension of our approach to more complex reaction networks, multi-step catalytic processes, and beyond lithium-oxygen systems will be an important direction. As quantum hardware continues to advance, the scalability of hybrid methods like Ext-SQD will be further tested, paving the way for practical quantum chemistry applications in energy storage and materials science.

The summation over T ensures that the constructed orbitals respect the translational periodicity of the system.[44, 45] All electronic structure calculations were performed using the PySCF pack- age [34], again employing the GTH-DZV basis set [32] alongside the Goedecker- Teter-Hutter (GTH) pseudopotentials [32] and the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) exchange-correlation functional [33].

Active Space Selection We localized the Kohn-Sham orbitals using the Pipek-Mezey method [47], which relies on a Mulliken population analysis with meta-L¨owdin orbitals [48, 49]. Localization was performed separately for occupied and virtual orbitals at each individual k-point to ensure that the electronic structure characteristics were properly preserved across the Brillouin zone. We computed the electronic density difference at the DFT level, as defined by ρDD(x) = |ρLi+O2(x) −ρO2(x) −ρLi(x)|, (3) which provides insights into charge redistribution during the reaction and is included in Figure 2b. To automate the selection of the active space, we ranked orbitals based on their contributions to the density difference. To quantify these contributions, we introduced a threshold parameter η that suppresses minor orbital components and retains only physically meaningful orbitals. By systematically varying this threshold, we identified a stable range where orbital rankings remain consistent, facilitating a robust and physically motivated selection of the active space. To mitigate this sensitivity, we identified a stable range of η ≈10−3 through a systematic scan.

Quantum Simulations The Sample-Based Quantum Diagonalization (SQD) [17, 21, 50] approach involves projecting the electronic Hamiltonian onto a subspace defined by a collection of electronic configurations sampled from a probability distribution. These set of con- figurations, denoted as X = {x}, are drawn from the wavefunction probability PΨ(x) = |⟨x|Ψ⟩|2, whereas a noisy version is represented by P ˜Ψ(x) = ⟨x|˜ρ|x⟩. The subset of configurations that maintain the correct particle number is labeled XN, and through a self-consistent recovery process, an expanded configuration set XR is con- structed. The electronic Hamiltonian ˆH is then projected onto this selected subspace, and its low-energy eigenvalues and eigenvectors are determined via direct diagonal- ization using the iterative Davidson algorithm[51] across multiple classical computing nodes [17]. To obtain the set of configurations, we sample a relevant circuit, an ansatz, on a quantum device. The Local Unitary Cluster Jastrow (LUCJ) [19] ansatz is a variational quantum circuit designed to generate approximate ground states of elec- tronic systems while maintaining a moderate circuit depth. It is derived from unitary coupled-cluster (UCC) theory but incorporates local approximations to reduce the number of required two-qubit gates, making it more suitable for near-term quantum devices.

While most of the time, the standard SQD method effectively estimates ground-state properties by constructing a subspace from sampled computational basis states, its reliance on configurations drawn from a quantum circuit approximating the ground state introduces a bias that can lead to an overestimation of the energies.[18] To address these limitations, Ext-SQD incorporates elements of Quantum Subspace Expansion (QSE) while main- taining the computational efficiency of SQD. In contrast to standard SQD, which forms excited states by solving for multiple eigenpairs of a projected Hamiltonian, Ext-SQD expands the accessible configuration space by explicitly applying excitation operators to the computational basis states in the original subspace.
