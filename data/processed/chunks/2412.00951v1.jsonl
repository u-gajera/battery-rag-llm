We present an integrated workflow combining density functional theory (DFT) with quantum algorithms through an active space embedding scheme, specifically applied to studying 1,2,4-Triazole and 1,2,4-Triazole- 3-thiol inhibitors on Al111 surfaces. Our implementation leverages the ADAPT-VQE algorithm with benchmarking against classical DFT calculations, achieving binding energies of -0.386 eV and -1.279 eV for 1,2,4-Triazole and 1,2,4-Triazole-3-thiol, respectively.

INTRODUCTION Metal surfaces in aerospace and automotive industries need effective protection against corrosion to enhance component lifespan and efficiency. While chromium- based inhibitors were historically used for their protec- tive capabilities [1], environmental concerns have driven a shift towards eco-friendly alternatives like smart coatings and organic inhibitors [1–3]. These alternatives main- tain compatibility with surface alloys while minimizing environmental impact, with organic inhibitors effectively forming protective films on metal surfaces [4]. Smart coating technologies have advanced the field by enabling real-time corrosion monitoring, crucial for aerospace and automotive applications [5]. Computational methods have accelerated corrosion in- hibition research. High-throughput electronic structure calculations and machine learning improve screening of potential inhibitor candidates [6].

METHODOLOGY Our inhibitor screening process leveraged the COR- DATA database [10], employing a multi-criteria approach to identify promising candidates for both automotive and aerospace applications. The primary screening criteria focused on efficiency, environmental stability, and struc- tural characteristics suitable for quantum computational analysis. We targeted inhibitors demonstrating relative efficiencies above 90% in corrosion prevention compared to Cr6+ for AA2024[11] and stability in the pH range of 5.5-7, which is most commonly encountered in both au- tomotive and aerospace environments[12]. Temperature resilience requirements were specific to each industry: - 30°C to 70°C for automotive applications and -50°C to 120°C for aerospace applications. In our model, we simplified the problem to the form of molecule adsorption on top of a substrate. We simpi- fied the substrate alloy to be a simple Al substrate and modeled the adsorption in vacuum. The larger the bind- ing energy the more efficient the inhibitor molecule to at- tach to the surface. The screening process ideally utilizes multiple computational tools in sequence. Initial filter- ing is performed through the CORDATA online platform, followed by toxicity predictions using Datamol’s QSAR capabilities[13, 14]. Due to time constraints in this phase and our focus on the quantum computational aspects, we concentrated on the CORDATA selection and related lit- erature. We focused on effective inhibitors when it", "page": 0, "position": 1}

Adhesion properties are crucial in studying corrosion inhibition mechanisms, as they directly influence in- hibitor molecule and aluminum surface interaction. Re- cent theoretical and experimental studies have estab- lished strong correlations between molecular adhesion strength and corrosion inhibition efficiency, particularly for triazole derivatives [19, 20]. Gonz´alez-Olvera et al.[21] demonstrated that triazole derivatives exhibiting strong surface adhesion show superior corrosion protection prop- erties. To quantify this interaction, we calculate the bind- ing energy (Ebinding = Esupercell −Einhibitor −Esubstrate), where stronger binding energies indicate more effective surface attachment and potentially better corrosion in- hibition performance. This approach aligns with exper- imental observations by Winkler et al.[15] and theoret- ical predictions [17], where stronger molecular adhesion correlates with enhanced corrosion protection. The rela- tionship between binding energy and inhibition efficiency has been further validated through combined theoretical and experimental studies [19]. From our comprehensive screening, three candidates emerged as particularly promising, as detailed in Table I. 1,2,4-Triazole-3-thiol demonstrates broad effectiveness across both AA2024 and AA7075 alloys, with its sulfur- containing functionality showing particular affinity for copper-rich AA2024[15]. Benzotriazole offers excellent efficiency and features an aromatic ring structure that enhances surface adhesion[11]. 2-Mercaptobenzimidazole combines both aromatic and sulfur functionalities, pro- viding effective performance across a wide pH range[15]. For our initial proof-of-concept studies, we selected 1,2,4-Triazole-3-thiol as the primary candidate. This choice was motivated by several factors: its balanced molecular weight makes it suitable for quantum calcu- lations while maintaining computational feasibility; its demonstrated effectiveness on both target alloys provides industrial relevance; and its wide pH range stability en- sures practical applicability. The sulfur functionality makes it particularly effective for AA2024, due to its higher copper content[15], enabling us to study signifi- cant electronic interactions within our quantum compu- tational framework. The structural simplicity of 1,2,4-Triazole-3-thiol, com- bined with its proven inhibition efficiency, makes it an ideal candidate for developing our quantum computa- tional methodology.

Although inhibitors are typically tested on alloy structures in industrial applications, our calculations will use an Al structure with Miller indices (111)[24, 25] instead of the alloy to simplify quantum computations. This approach provides a practical bal- ance between computational tractability and real-world applicability, a consideration particularly important for establishing proof-of-concept in quantum chemistry cal- culations of corrosion inhibition mechanisms. Our computational approach combines classical DFT calculations with quantum computing methods through an active space embedding scheme implemented in CP2K[26] in conjunction with Qiskit nature [27, 28]. Battaglia et al. [29] have implemented an effective in- terface between CP2K and Qiskit nature allowing both codes to communicate messages; for implementation de- tails refer to [30], We slightly updated it in [31]. The DFT calculations were performed using the Perdew- Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE)[32] exchange-correlation func- tional within the generalized gradient approximation (GGA)[33]. We employed the Gaussian and Plane Waves (GPW)[34] method with a 500 Ry plane-wave cutoff and a relative cutoff of 60 Ry, using double-zeta valence po- larized (DZVP-MOLOPT-GTH) basis sets optimized for molecular systems[35]. The van der Waals interactions, crucial for accurate descriptions of inhibitor-surface inter- actions, were accounted for through Grimme’s DFT-D3 dispersion correction scheme[36], using PBE as the refer- ence functional. The system was treated under periodic boundary conditions with a vacuum gap of 25 ˚A in the z- direction to prevent interactions between periodic images and give dipole correction to the system. The surface was modeled using a 4×4 supercell of Al(111), and elec- tronic states were populated according to a Fermi-Dirac distribution with an electronic temperature of 1000 K to aid convergence. Worth mentioning that at the time of writing, CP2K with external active space solver for the embedding approach is only compatible with Qiskit through [30], and this workflow could be the only open- source approach available at the time", "page": 1, "position": 1}

For more details re- garding the classical implementation details in our work- flow, please refer to the computational part in the Sup- plementary material section. The active space was constructed with 2 active elec- trons in 5 orbitals around the Fermi level, where the adsorption interactions between the inhibitor and alu- minum substrate predominantly occur. The electron re- pulsion integrals (ERIs) for the active space were com- puted using the full GPW method, maintaining period- icity in all directions. SCF convergence was set to 1.0E-6 Ha, with Broyden mixing[37] (α = 0.1, β = 1.5) employed to accelerate convergence. The embedding scheme itera- tions continued until the energy difference between subse- quent iterations was less than 1E-6 Ha, with a maximum of 100 iterations permitted. Our quantum computational approach centered on the ADAPT-VQE algorithm[38], implemented through Qiskit and executed on Braket simulators. The im- plementation follows recent developments in hybrid quantum-classical embedding methods developed by Battaglia et al.[29], particularly for periodic systems. We run our workflow with the standard VQE (we called vanilla VQE only) with the Unitary Coupled Cluster Sin- gles and Doubles (UCCSD) ansatz[39], AdaptVQE from Qiskit with its dynamically constructed ansatz[40], and StatefulVQE from qiskit-nature-cp2k [30] incorporating warm-starting techniques[41, 42].

We employed the ActiveSpaceTransformer as implemented in Qiskit, following the framework described by Battaglia et al.[29] for periodic systems. Meanwhile, the charge density dif- ference (CDD) approach of Gujarati et al.[44], previously referenced in our phase 1 work, can be used here as well which is particularly effective for surface-adsorbate sys- tems.

The computational details summary table in the sup- plementary materials provides a comprehensive summary of all computational parameters and methods used in this work.

Our ADAPT-VQE implementation included an op- erator pool consisting of single and double fermionic excitations[38], with convergence criteria set to an en- ergy threshold of 1e-6 Hartree and a gradient norm threshold of 1e-4.

III. RESULTS The geometry-optimized structures of 1,2,4-Triazole and 1,2,4-Triazole-3-thiol adsorbed on the 4×4 Al sub- strate are shown in Fig.1. The optimization process, performed using the orb-d3-v2 ML potential model, re- sulted in equilibrium binding distances of 3.54˚A for 1,2,4- Triazole and 3.21˚A for 1,2,4-Triazole-3-thiol between the molecules and the substrate surface. To validate our hybrid quantum-classical approach, we compared the binding energies calculated using both clas- sical DFT and two quantum computational methods: vanilla VQE (normal VQE) and AdaptVQE, as summa- rized in Table II. The results show excellent agreement between classical DFT and AdaptVQE methods for both inhibitors, with AdaptVQE yielding binding energies of -0.385508 eV and -1.279064 eV for 1,2,4-Triazole and 1,2,4-Triazole-3-thiol, respectively. These values closely match the classical DFT results (-0.385512 eV and - 1.279063 eV). However, the vanilla VQE implementation showed significant deviation, producing a notably higher binding energy (-2.325986 eV) for 1,2,4-Triazole. This discrepancy between vanilla VQE and AdaptVQE results can be attributed to several factors in our com- putational setup. First, the VQE-only case used a less stringent energy convergence threshold for the DFT em- bedding scheme of 2E-5. compared to the AdaptVQE implementation, using 1E-6. This difference in conver- gence thresholds can lead to premature convergence in the VQE case, potentially trapping the algorithm in a local minimum that yields artificially high binding ener- gies. We chosen to easen the convergency for VQE only case as it was very slow to converge. Additionally, the AdaptVQE implementation’s adaptive operator pool se- lection, guided by", "page": 2, "position": 1}

[17], who demonstrated that sulfur-containing tri- azole derivatives not only exhibit enhanced corrosion in- hibition efficiency but also form more effective protec- tive layers on metal surfaces. The stronger binding en- ergy correlates with the shorter equilibrium binding dis- tance (3.21˚A vs 3.54˚A) observed for the thiol derivative, supporting experimental findings about sulfur’s role in strengthening surface interactions and promoting more effective surface passivation [18]. This behavior is con- sistent with Swathi et al.’s [17] observations regard- ing the improved adsorption characteristics of sulfur- functionalized inhibitors on metal surfaces. For more accurate results, we anticipate that expand- ing the active space to include more orbitals in the AdaptVQE calculation could lead to different binding energies compared to the classical approach. Follow- ing the active space construction approach of Battaglia et al. [29], we included 2 electrons in 5 orbitals (10 spin-orbitals in total) around the Fermi level. However, while their active space primarily captured localized de- fect states with one delocalized conduction band, our active space needs to describe the surface-adsorbate in- teraction, where both localized molecular orbitals from the inhibitor and delocalized surface states from the Al substrate contribute to the bonding [47, 48]. This inter- action involves complex hybridization between molecular orbitals and substrate states [49], particularly around the Fermi level, suggesting that a larger active space might better capture these electronic coupling effects in full. The computational parameters and additional technical details are provided in Table III. The implementation builds upon established method- ologies as implemented by Battaglia et al. in [29] while introducing flexibility to deal with adsorption-substrate models in periodic systems in quantum computing frame- work of Qiskit and Braket.

To establish a robust computa- tional workflow, we first benchmarked various algorithms of calculating the ground state energies using simpler sys- tems using the LiH molecule. The benchmarking process consisted of three main components: Standard VQE Algorithm Comparison Initial benchmarking compared three VQE implemen- tations using LiH as a test system.

Active Space Analysis Our active space selection methodology combined the ActiveSpaceTransformer implementation from Qiskit with the embedding approach as implemented in CP2K code [26] as detailed in their manual [62], utilizing the HARTREE-FOCK model to calculate active space in- teraction Hamiltonian. Following the recent framework by Battaglia et al. [29], we employed the CANONICAL method for orbital selection, which orders orbitals based on their energy. This approach proved particularly ef- fective for our surface-adsorbate systems, as the energy- ordered canonical orbitals naturally aligned with the or- bitals around the Fermi level that are crucial for the ad- sorption process. The analysis revealed several signifi- cant electronic contributions to the corrosion inhibition mechanism, including the π-system of the triazole ring, the lone pair electrons on the sulfur atom (specifically for 1,2,4-Triazole-3-thiol), and the surface states at the Al(111) interface. These electronic features and their in- teractions align well with experimental observations by Winkler et al. [15] and SWATHI et al. [17] regarding the mechanism of corrosion inhibition by triazole derivatives, validating our computational approach to active space selection. S5. The adopted Hamiltonian The electronic Hamiltonian was constructed following the second-quantized formalism[41]: ˆH = X pq hpqˆa† pˆaq + 1 2 X pqrsgpqrsˆa† pˆa† rˆasˆaq (1) where hpq and gpqrs represent the one- and two- electron integrals computed within the active space. The fermionic operators were mapped to qubit operators us- ing the parity mapping with two-qubit reduction[55], which was chosen for its efficient handling of particle number conservation. S6. Simulation SDKs and hardware We made some effort in running our simulations on Braket SDK [46, 63] through the integration tool qiskit- braket-provider [64].

Phase2 workflow and github link Fig. 3 illustrates our integrated classical and quantum computational approach that we introduced during phase 1 and edited a bit in phase 2, yet we believe that the main core functionalities are still there. The workflow emphasizes the steps from classical geometry optimization through quantum electronic structure calculations and algorithm application on the chosen systems.
