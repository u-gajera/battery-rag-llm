With increasing demands on lithium batteries to operate at lower temperatures and higher currents, it is crucial to understand lithium intercalation in graphite due to issues associated with lithium plating. Lithium intercalation into graphite has been extensively studied theoretically using density functional theory (DFT) calculations, complemented by experimental studies through X-ray diﬀraction, spectroscopy, optical imaging and other techniques. In this work, we present a ﬁrst principles based model using DFT calculations, employing the BEEF-vdW as the exchange correlation functional, and Ising model to determine the phase transformations and subsequently, the thermodynamic intercalation potential diagram. We explore a conﬁgurational phase space of about 1 billion structures by accurately determining the important interactions for the Ising model. The BEEF-vdW exchange correlation functional employed accurately captures a range of interac- tions including vdW, covalent and ionic interactions. We incorporate phonon contributions at ﬁnite temperatures and conﬁgurational entropy to get high accuracy in free energy and potentials. We utilize the built-in error estimation capabilities of the BEEF-vdW exchange correlation functional and to develop a methodological framework for determining the uncertainty associated with DFT calculated phase diagrams and intercalation potentials. The framework also determines the conﬁ- dence of each predicted stable phase. The conﬁdence value of a phase can help us to identify regions of solid solutions and phase transformations accurately. Given the subtle diﬀerences in energy be- tween lithium intercalation into graphite and lithium plating (<0.1 eV), we believe such an error estimation framework is crucial to know the reliability of DFT predictions.

I. INTRODUCTION Graphite is the most ubiquitous anode material used in Li-ion batteries owing to its very low potential, high cycle life and low cost.1,2 Lithium ion batteries used in a variety of applications (e.g. electric vehicles) are re- quired to perform at low temperatures3 and also very high current rates4. Under these conditions, the major factor impacting cycle life is lithium plating.5–7 Lithium plating occurs when the anode potential is lower than the lithium redox potential.8 To understand the lithium plat- ing phenomenon, we ﬁrst need to accurately understand the lithium-graphite phase diagram and the open cir- cuit voltage proﬁle. This raises an important question of whether propensity for lithium plating is thermodynamic or kinetic. Lithium intercalation in graphite has been the subject of numerous experimental and theoretical investigations.9–17 The various phases of lithium interca- lation into graphite have been characterized using X-ray diﬀraction (XRD),18–20 optical methods21 and spectro- scopic methods.22 However, due to the high degree of dis- order, its diﬃcult to precisely pinpoint the structure for a particular phase in the lithium-graphite phase diagram, especially the low lithium content phases.9,11 Identiﬁca- tion of the lithium-graphite phases will also enable us in studying the lithium diﬀusivity in these phases and pin- point kinetic limitations for intercalation. Theoretical studies employing density functional theory calculations have been used to complement the experimental under- standing and have painted a clearer picture of lithium- graphite phase diagram.16,23–34. A variety of exchange- correlation functionals have been employed to determine the stable phases and lead to vastly diﬀerent intercala- tion potentials and diﬀerent stable phases.

It is also important to quantify the conﬁdence of predict- ing a stable phase using DFT as it is going to have direct impact on the intercalation potential. For high accuracy, it is important to include the small contributions from conﬁgurational entropy and ﬁnite temperature contribu- tions from phonons. Lastly it has also been shown that at a given x in LixC6, lithium-graphite exists as a mixture of stage 1, stage 2 and stage 3 compounds.35 A simple convex hull approach, as used earlier, will be unable to capture such disorder. Thus, there is a need to develop theoretical methods to identify regions of coexistence of phases more accurately and also the speciﬁc phases that exist during coexistence.

As lithium intercalates in the space between theses sheets, there is an increase in the Li-C covalent inter- actions along with a decrease in the van der Waals in- teractions between the graphite sheets.36,37 Given that the subtle interplay between these two interactions de- termines the phase diagram, it is crucial to employ an ex- change correlation function that is capable of accurately predicting over a wide range of bonding environments.29 BEEF-vdW is designed such that it minimizes prediction error for a range of data sets involving molecular for- mation energies, molecular reaction energies, molecular reaction barriers, non-covalent interactions, solid state properties, and chemisorption on solid surfaces.38 In ad- dition, the functional possesses Bayesian error estima- tion, which is designed to reproduce known energetic errors by mapping the uncertainties on the exchange- correlation parameters. This capability allows an er- ror estimation capability and has been employed suc- cessfully to understand uncertainties associated with re- action rates in heterogeneous catalysis,39 activity rela- tionships in electrocatalysis,40,41 mechanical properties of solid electrolytes42 and magnetic materials43. BEEF- vdW correctly predicts the adhesion of two graphene sheets to be stable by 0.07 eV. In this study, we will build a reﬁned picture for lithium- graphite phase diagram employing density functional theory calculations using BEEF-vdW exchange correla- tion functional.

METHODOLOGY In this work, we will focus on the electrochemical lithium intercalation in natural graphite given by: x(Li+ + e−) + C6 ⇌LixC6 (1) The phase transformation of lithium-graphite com- pounds is determined by the Gibbs free energy change associated with this process given by: ∆G = GLixC6 −GC6 −xGLi+ −xGe− (2) where GLixC6 is the free energy of the lithium-graphite phase, GC6 is the free energy of the graphite phase, GLi+ is the free energy of the Li ion solvated by the electrolyte and Ge−is the free energy of the electron at the potential of the graphite electrode.

The sum of the free energy of the Li ions and the electrons can be related to the free energy of bulk lithium metal as shown through the reaction: Li+ + e−⇌Li(s) (3) which gives us the relation GLi+ + Ge− U=0V = GLi(s). This is termed as the computational lithium electrode and pro- vides a tractable way to determine the sum of the free en- ergies of Li ion and electron for concerted Li ion-electron transfer reactions.44 Through this relation, the free en- ergy of an electron is now calculated relative to the po- tential of Li/Li+ redox couple, Ge−= Ge− U=0V −eULi/Li+. Thus substituting the relation in Eq. 3, we get: ∆G = GLixC6 −GC6 −xGLi(s) + x(eULi/Li+) (4) Eq. 4 gives the intercalation potential of a particular phase of the lithium-graphite phase diagram. To derive the thermodynamic intercalation potential diagram, we need to consider phase transformation from one stable phase to another as lithium insets into graphite. The potential for phase transformation from Lix0C6 to Lix1C6 can thus be expressed as: V = −GLix1C6 −GLix0C6 −(x1 −x0)GLi(s) x1 −x0 (5) To calculate the intercalation potentials, we need to cal- culate the free energies of the stable phases. For a par- ticular phase LixC6, we have large number of possible structures due to a number of possible sites that lithium atoms can occupy between the graphene sheets with dif- ferent free energies. Under a thermodynamic formula- tion, intercalation will proceed through phases with the minimum free energy.

Enthalpy Calculation The enthalpy of formation, ∆H of a system con- sists of the internal energy change of the system, ∆U and the pressure-volume work, ∆PV. It has been shown that the pressure volume work is negli- gible compared to the change in internal energy for lithium-graphite structures.45 The internal energy of all lithium-graphite structures, lithium and graphite is calculated using density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The density functional theory calcula- tions are carried out using GPAW, which is a real space implementation of the projector-augmented wave method.46,47 The DFT energies are then used to ﬁnd the enthalpy of formation for each of the structures given by ∆H = HLixC6 −xHLi −HC6. Lithium intercalation in graphite is an interplay be- tween Li-C interactions, Li-Li repulsion and C-C vdW forces. Thus, it is important to choose an appropri- ate exchange correlation functional for the DFT calcula- tions. Experiments have shown that lithium intercalates in graphite in stages.9,11 A stage ‘n’ lithium-graphite phase implies that there are n layers of graphene between two adjacent Li layers. In this work, we will explore phases with stages 1, 2, 3 and 4. Phases with higher stages are computationally very expensive to calculate due to the large number of atoms in the unit cell. All DFT calculations were done with BEEF-vdW ex- change correlation functional and used a Monkhorst-Pack grid for the Brillouin zone sampling.48 A convergence of 5 meV/6C was achieved with 10×10×10 k-point grid for a graphite unit cell (4C atoms). For the lithium-graphite phases, the k-points were appropriately scaled down as per the size of the unit cell for each of the phases, so as to maintain the same level of convergence. A grid spacing, h = 0.18˚A and a Fermi-Dirac smearing width of 0.05 eV was used. The graphite AA and AB stacking structures were con- sidered and the AB stacking structure is more stable by 0.09 eV compared to the AA stacking structure, consis- tent with experiments.36,37 We also considered the en- ergy for fully intercalated lithium-graphite phase (LiC6) for the AA and AB stacking structures and the", "page": 2, "position": 0}

The insertion of lithium into graphite leads to expan- sion of the lattice.10 To get accurate lattice constants for each of the Li-graphite structures, we ﬁrst expand graphite in-plane followed by an expansion out of plane and carry out an energy minimization. The lithium-graphite phases have a large number of structural possibilities due to the large number of sites available for Li in graphite. A systematic way of ac- counting for this structural disorder is through the Ising model. 2-body cluster expansion which is similar to Ising model, has been previously used to describe the Li- graphite phases and other intercalation compounds like LixCoO2, LixTiS2, etc.23,49,50 In the Ising model, the Li sites are considered as a lattice model and an occupation variable is assigned to each Li site. We deﬁne the occu- pation variable, s, to be 1 if the site is occupied by Li and 0 when the site is empty. The formation enthalpy of the system is then derived in terms of these occupation variables as ∆H = C + V X i si + X i,j Ji,jsisj (6) where si is the occupation variable associated with site ‘i’, V is the energy associated with lithium occupying a site ‘i’ in the graphite and Ji,j are the various interactions between two Li atoms occupying two sites in the lattice model.

The various kinds of two-body interactions Ji,j can be associated with the diﬀerent distances between the lithium occupied sites. As these Li-Li interactions are electrostatic in nature, we expect them to decrease with increasing distance. Here, we consider interactions with distance less than 5a where a is the distance between two adjacent carbon atoms in the graphite network. As we show later, interactions beyond this distance are neg- ligible. For structures with stage n ≥2 , the distance between occupied sites in diﬀerent planes is greater than 5a and hence there would be no out-of-plane interactions. However there will be interactions for stage 1 structures. As a result, we have two diﬀerent Ising models, one for stage 1 and another for stage n ≥2. One thing of note is that ∆H = 0 for graphite which implies that C = 0 in Eq. 6.

We count all interactions in the unit cell and with neighbor- ing unit cells with appropriate weights. For the stage 3 and stage 4 structures, out-of-plane interactions are negligible and hence neglected, which means that their energy can be calculated from the stage 2 structures as follows: ∆HStage 3 = 2 3∆HStage 2 + HC6,Stage 2 −HC6,Stage 3 (9) ∆HStage 4 = 2 4∆HStage 2 + HC6,Stage 2 −HC6,Stage 4 (10) The last two terms in Eq. 9 and Eq. 10 account for the energy required to reorient the graphene sheets to a dif- ferent stacking.

A regression analysis on these 32 DFT calculated structures gives all the interactions.

Phonon Calculations The phonon calculations were implemented using the density functional perturbation theory (DFPT)52 in Quantum Espresso.53 The calculations were done using ultra-soft pseudopotentials. The lattice parameters were taken from the GPAW calculations and re-optimized in Quantum Espresso54 before doing the phonon calcula- tions. The optB88-vdW55 exchange correlation func- tional which employs the vdW-DF56–59 non local correc- tion was used for phonon calculations because the phonon dispersion curves agree very well with experiments.29 For the phonon calculations, the structures were further re- laxed until the forces on atoms are less than 1 meV/˚A. A kinetic energy cutoﬀof 550 eV is employed for the plane wave expansion of the wave-functions and a 5500 eV cutoﬀwas chosen for charge density and potential. The same k-point grid mentioned earlier was used for the phonon calculations. The phonon density of states were calculated for Li, C6, LiC6, LiC8, LiC12 and LiC18.

A graphite block of N atoms due to its hexagonal symmetry will have N/2 sites for lithium to occupy. From the interaction coeﬃcients, we can see that the ﬁrst in-plane interaction coeﬃcient is signiﬁcantly larger than the others, which implies that it is very unfavorable for two lithium atoms to occupy adjacent sites. Hence due to the hexagonal symmetry of graphite, we can only ﬁll a Li among 3 adjacent sites. This implies that for a particular phase x of LixC6, the total conﬁgurations Ωof possible Li ordering is the num- ber of ways of arranging Nx 6 lithium atoms in N 6 sites. This is valid for a stage 1 compound where the Li can occupy every layer of graphite. Now to include staging, we have to reduce the number of lithium sites as every layer will not be occupied. Based on the deﬁnition of staging, a stage n compound will have N 6n sites. Thus Ω= \u0000 N 6 Nx 6n \u0001 . The conﬁgurational entropy for LixC6 for N carbon atoms can now be written as follows: Sconf = kBln(Ω) (15) For our model, we need to normalize the conﬁgurational entropy to 6 carbon atoms. i. e. sconf = 6 NSconf. Now we can derive the expression for conﬁgurational entropy of phase x as given by: sconf = 6kB N ln \u0012 N 6 Nx 6n \u0013! (16) After applying the Stirling’s approximation for large N, the conﬁgurational entropy for a stage n compound can be expressed as: sconf = −kB xln(x) + 1 nln \u00101 n \u0011 + \u00101 n −x \u0011 ln \u00101 n −x \u0011!

These ensemble of energies represents the energies calculated from an ensemble of 2000 exchange correla- tion functionals and hence determines the DFT uncer- tainty for energy. This uncertainty is propagated in the Ising model by determining the Ising model coeﬃcients for every functional through regression, resulting in an ensemble for each coeﬃcient. For every functional in the ensemble, we then calculate the energies for all possible structures using the Ising model. After adding the con- tributions from phonons and conﬁgurational entropy, we determine the convex hull of phases and in turn the volt- age diagram for each functional in the ensemble. Each ensemble will give a unique phase diagram. For each of the identiﬁed phases in all functionals, we can deter- mine the conﬁdence of determining the phase as a stable phase. A stable phase is the phase with minimum Gibbs free energy for a given x. Recently, the concept of conﬁ- dence value was deﬁned in context of magnetic ordering of materials.43 Similarly, we deﬁne the conﬁdence value of a phase can be deﬁned as the fraction of BEEF en- semble of functionals that predict the phase as a stable phase for a given x.

If all functionals predict a phase to be stable, the corresponding conﬁdence value is 1, while no functional predicts a phase to be stable, the conﬁdence value is 0. When a large fraction of functionals predict the same stable phase for a given x, then there is a high conﬁdence that the prediction is independent of exchange correlation functional and is likely to be the qualitatively correct. Such an approach has been utilized successfully to identify majority of the stable phases of Li-Ni-Co-Mn oxide.60 Neglecting the uncertainty in phonon calculations, this method gives us the exact uncertainty estimates for the lithium-graphite phase diagram predicted from GGA level DFT calculations.

Table I in the S.I. provides the dif- ferent kind of interactions, the exact LixC6 phase, the lat- tice constants for each of the structures, the stage number for the 32 structures considered. The ZPE is added later in the phonon contribution to enthalpy. The in-plane lattice constant a increases slightly upon lithium intercalation. However, out-of-plane lattice con- stant, c, which is the distance between adjacent graphene sheets signiﬁcantly increases upon lithium intercalation to a maximum increase of 10.8% upon full intercalation. c", "page": 4, "position": 2}

The conﬁgurational entropy is dependent on stage and lithium fraction as described in the methods and has signiﬁcant contribution of ∼0.02 eV at T = 298 K for phases x<0.25 in LixC6, but it is <0.01 eV for phases x>0.25. The vibrational contribution to free energy due to phonons is shown in Fig. 4. We see that the vibra- tion entropy contribution is small and negative, about ∼-5 meV. We can attribute this loss of entropy to the hindered motion of the lithium atoms in the intercalated phases as compared to bulk lithium. The total entropy of a phase is the sum of conﬁgurational and vibrational entropy. Thus, we can see that the the entropy is pos- itive for phases x<0.25 but negative for x>0.25 which agrees qualitatively with measurements done by Reynier et al.11 In the work by Reynier et al., the entropy change was calculated by measuring the change in open circuit voltages in half cells with graphite electrodes for a small change in temperature.

We ﬁnd that the ∆ZPE dominates the enthalpic contribution due to phonons. The ∆ZPE contribution is negative as the high frequency modes of graphite shift to lower frequen- cies upon intercalation as seen Fig 1. in S.I. To construct the phase diagram of Li-graphite, we need to choose the structures which lie on the convex hull of free energy vs. x in LixC6 diagram. The phase diagram being the convex hull is a result of the condition that a system in thermodynamic equilibrium minimizes its free energy. The convex hull is derived from the 1 billion points which gives the phase diagram as shown in Fig. 5. From the convex hull, we evaluate the intercalation po- tentials, using the free energy of the most stable phases. The intercalation potential diagram is shown in Fig. 7.

The experimental results are from very slow lithiation and delithiation of graphite at C/100 current rates. The disagreement in potential for low x phases might be from a number of factors including errors from phonon contri- butions, SEI formation in experiments, errors from Ising model, etc. The energy diﬀerences for these low x phases are quite small, which means that the potentials are more sensitive to errors. However, it is worth pointing out that we are able to predict all of the phase transformations ob- served in experiments accurately. The BEEF ensemble of energies was used to propagate uncertainty in the Ising model and phase diagrams. The ensemble of convex hulls for Gibbs free energy vs x is shown in Fig. 5. We see that a large number of GGA functionals predict similar convex hulls as the BEEF optimal functional. However, there are several functionals which predict vastly diﬀer- ent stable phases and widely varying intercalation po- tentials. This shows that the choice of functional is very important in predicting phase diagrams and raises an im- portant question of how robust are the identiﬁed phases and intercalation potentials, which is discussed below. The BEEF optimal functional predicts a phase dia- gram where there are about 10 stable stage 4 phases for x<0.1. This is followed by a phase transformation to stage 3 x = 0.1 phase. The next stage transformation is to stage 2 compounds x = 0.3, x = 1/3, x = 0.4685 and x = 0.5. This is followed by transformation to stage 1 compounds x = 0.75, x = 5/6 and x = 1.

For 0.1 < x < 0.3, the con- ﬁdence value is very low, which suggests that this region is most likely comprising of a mixture of stage 4, stage 3 and stage 2 compounds.

All these phases and mixture of phases at a given x agree very well with those observed in experiments by X-ray diﬀraction,9 and optical measurements21. In Fig. 6, we also compare the conﬁdence value with the experimen- tally measured fraction of phases present at a given x and see that there is a qualitative similarity in the data. We observe similar coexistence of compounds of diﬀerent stages and that the experimental data might be mixtures of the phases with conﬁdence value >0.25. The threshold conﬁdence value does not have a ﬁrm basis and needs fur- ther basis. The experimental data might have some error in x data due to formation of SEI.35 Thus, a low conﬁ- dence value can be used as an indicator of existence of multiple stable structures at given x, i.e. a solid solution. The ensemble of intercalation potentials at each x was used to create a probability density function (pdf). The ensemble gives 2000 predicted potentials at each x. A histogram for these 2000 values with 0.01 V bin width is then used to create a pdf at that x. This pdf is plotted as the contour in Fig. 7. The pdf gives us the robustness in intercalation potential of GGA level DFT. As shown in Fig. 7, the probability of predicting the correct voltage increases with x. Also the pdf maximum near x = 1 is slightly diﬀerent than the BEEF optimal but is actually very close to the experiment. This suggests that like- lihood of predicting the correct intercalation potentials could be much higher using multiple functionals than a single functional. A similar idea of using an adaptively weighted sum of energies from multiple functionals to get better agreement with experiments has been shown for adsorption energies.61 This can be attributed to the fact that use of multiple functionals can accurately determine a larger variety of energetic interactions and bonding en- vironments.

We also calculated the temperature dependence of the phase diagram for the BEEF optimal functional from - 25◦C to 50◦C. We ﬁnd that in this temperature range, we do not observe any change in the phase diagram and the ﬁnal intercalation potential plateau decreases by 0.01 V as shown in Fig 2 in S.I. This small change in voltage corresponds to only a 1% change in the onset of lithium plating, corresponding to voltage of 0. However, higher amount of lithium plating has been observed experimen- tally at cold temperatures (∼-20◦C).8 This suggests that lithium plating is probably dependent on kinetics and not thermodynamics. The identiﬁcation of diﬀerent stable structures at a given x enables calculations for getting a better under- standing of lithium diﬀusion in graphite. The stage 4 and stage 3 compounds that exist at low x phases deter- mine the initial kinetic barrier for lithium intercalation in graphite and hence should be studied more carefully. The transport in these compounds may help us to un- derstand and decouple other kinetic eﬀects from SEI and anode microstructure.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION The presented framework comprising of DFT and sta- tistical thermodynamics accurately predicts the phase di- agram and intercalation potentials for electrochemical Li intercalation in natural graphite. We highlight the im- portance of accurately capturing vdW interactions and zero point energies to determine the stable phases during intercalation. We introduced a method to evaluate un- certainty of free energies of various phases and the asso- ciated intercalation potentials through the built-in error estimation capability of the BEEF-vdW exchange corre- lation functional. We have derived conﬁdence values for diﬀerent phases, which represents the uncertainty associ- ated with DFT predicting them as stable phases. We also associate the conﬁdence value with the fraction of phases existing at given x and get a good agreement with ex- periments. The conﬁdence value we believe would be a good indicator to identify the disorder at a given concen-", "page": 7, "position": 2}

We also ﬁnd that predicting intercalation potentials from a statistical approach using multiple functionals will give us more robust predictions and may yield better agreement with experiments. Lastly we determine that the lithium-graphite phase diagram is not sensitive to changes in temperature, suggesting that the dominant eﬀect triggering lithium plating in lithium ion cells is not thermodynamic. This high ﬁdelity, large scale prediction of lithium-graphite phase diagram incor- porating uncertainty and other important corrections will be important for next-generation robust battery material design.
