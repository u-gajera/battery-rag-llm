Hine Department of Materials, Imperial College London, South Kensington, London, SW7 2AZ, UK. (Dated: September 5, 2018) Abstract One of the main sources of error associated with the calculation of defect formation energies using plane-wave Density Functional Theory (DFT) is ﬁnite size error resulting from the use of relatively small simulation cells and periodic boundary conditions. Most widely-used methods for correcting this error, such as that of Makov and Payne, assume that the dielectric response of the material is isotropic and can be described using a scalar dielectric constant ϵ. However, this is strictly only valid for cubic crystals, and cannot work in highly-anisotropic cases. Here we introduce a variation of the technique of extrapolation based on the Madelung potential, that allows the calculation of well converged dilute limit defect formation energies in non-cubic systems with highly anisotropic dielectric properties. As an example of the implementation of this technique we study a selection of defects in the ceramic oxide Li2TiO3 which is currently being considered as a lithium battery material and a breeder material for fusion reactors. 1 arXiv:1303.5377v2 [cond-mat.mtrl-sci] 22 Mar 2013", "page": 0, "position": 0}

INTRODUCTION Point defects play an essential role in a number of important materials properties such the accommodation of nonstoichiomety and facilitation of diﬀusion through a crystal matrix. The diﬃculties associated with making direct observations on such small length scales mean it is desirable for ﬁrst principles methods such as Density Functional Theory (DFT) to provide insight into the properties and behaviour of both intrinsic and extrinsic point defects. In DFT, point defects are normally modelled using the supercell methodology, whereby vacancy, interstitial or substitutional defects are placed in a simulation supercell which is then tesselated though space using periodic boundary conditions (PBCs) to create an inﬁnite crystal. Therefore, any defect included in the original supercell will also be tesselated and the interaction of these defect images can have a signiﬁcant inﬂuence on the defect formation energy. This problem is particulary acute in the case of charged defects as the Coulomb interaction decays slowly as a function of the separation between point charges1. A number of correction schemes have been devised to extract the formation energies in the desired dilute limit from simulations of relatively small supercells: these have been widely applied to systems such as silicon2,3, NaCl2,4, diamond5,6, GaAs5–8, InP9 and Al2O310,11. Inherent in all of these schemes is the assumption that the dielectric response of the material is isotropic and can be described by a single dielectric constant, ϵ. Strictly, this only holds for cubic systems, but in many cases the degree of anisotropy is modest enough that the assumption of an isotropic dielectric response is adequate8,10,12. Intuitively, one might expect that this would not be the case for many of the more complex crystals that are currently being proposed for industrial applications, particularly those with layered structures. One such system is lithium metatitanate, β-Li2TiO3, which is currently under considera- tion for use in lithium ion batteries13 and as breeder material in fusion reactors14. Li2TiO3 may be described as a distorted rocksalt structure (space group C2/c) with alternating Li, LiTi2 and O planes15–17 which are clearly visible in Fig. 1.

The linear “muﬃn-tin” orbitals method has been used to study H substitution onto Li sites where the hydrogen is observed to move from the lithium site and bond to an oxygen forming a hydroxide19. One of the principle reasons for this shortage of theoretical results is the very same problem we try to address in this paper: namely that the anisotropy of the system means that it is hard to extract well-converged formation energies. In this study we investigate the convergence of the formation energies of point defects in monoclinic β−Li2TiO3 as a function of supercell size. Speciﬁcally, we study the V−4 Ti , Li−3 Ti and O−2 i defects (modiﬁed Kr¨oger-Vink notation). These defects represent a range of diﬀerent defect types and also have high charge states and so are subject to the largest ﬁnite-size errors. II. METHODOLOGY The DFT simulations presented here were performed using the plane-wave pseudo- potential code CASTEP20. Exchange-correlation is described using the generalised gradient approximation of Perdew, Burke and Ernzerhof (GGA-PBE)21. A Γ-centered Monkhorst- Pack22 scheme was used to sample the Brillouin zone with the separation of points maintained as close as possible to 0.05 ˚A−1 along each axis. The same pseudopotentials as in previous work17 (ultrasoft pseudo-potentials (USPs), generated “on-the-ﬂy” in CASTEP, and normconserving pseudopotentials (NCPPs) from the standard library in Materials Studio) were employed here. The planewave kinetic energies were truncated at 550 eV and 1700 eV for the USP and NCPPs respectively. The Fourier transform grid for the electron density is larger than that of the wavefunctions by a scaling factor of 2.0 and the corresponding scaling for the augmentation densities was set to 2.3 when USPs were in use. These values were determined by performing convergence tests of the energy from self consistent single point simulations. The lattice parameters determined using DFT are within 1% of the experimental as shown in Table I. Additionally a comparison of all the atomic positions has been included in the Supplementary Materials. Supercells for the defect simulations were then constructed by creating l×m×n repetitions of the", "page": 2, "position": 0}

Underestimation of the bandgap is a common feature of LDA and GGA calculations: fortunately the lack of occupied states in the band gap for the fully charged defects investigated here ensures that the defect formation energies reported are not directly aﬀected by this source of error10, although there are still eﬀects due to the localization of states. The implementation of a hybrid functional, such as the HSE functional26 would most likely change the defect formation energies. However, it is important to note that whatever functional is used, formation energies are still subject to similar ﬁnite- size eﬀects, as these are determined almost entirely by the Coulombic interaction of periodic images, with functional-dependent eﬀects being limited to the polarizability and localisation of charges. Following the formalism of Zhang and Northup27 the formation energy of a defect is given by: Ef = ET defect −ET perf + X i niµi + qEF (1) where ET defect and ET perf are the DFT total energies of a system with and without the defect, ni is the number of atoms added/removed, µi is the chemical potential of species i, q is the 4", "page": 3, "position": 0}

Representative chemical potential potentials (µLi, µTi and µO) were generated starting from the assumption that Li2TiO3 can be formed from Li2O and TiO2 via reaction 2 (this approach has been adopted for simplicity, though we note that this is not the traditional route for synthesis of Li2TiO328), Li2O(s) + TiO2(s) →Li2TiO3(s). (2) The sum of the chemical potentials of the constituent species must equal the total Gibbs free energy of the Li2TiO3, i.e. µTiO2 (pO2, T) + µLi2O (pO2, T) = µLi2TiO3(s) (3) where, µTiO2 (pO2, T) and µLi2O (pO2, T) are the chemical potentials of Li2O and TiO2 within lithium metatitanate as a function of oxygen partial pressure and temperature and µLi2TiO3(s) is the chemical potential of solid Li2TiO3. For a solid µ (O◦ 2, T ◦) ≈µ (0, 0) therefore the temperature and pressure dependencies have been dropped. Two limiting cases are envisaged, one in which the titanate is formed with excess Li2O, ie. µLi2O (pO2, T) = µLi2O(s) and µTiO2 (pO2, T) = µLi2TiO3(s) −µLi2O(s) and similarly titania rich formation con- ditions where µTiO2 (pO2, T) = µTiO2(s).

This energy (scaled by ϵ to represent dielectric screening in the material) arises due to the use of PBCs and is therefore an artifact of the simulation technique and must be removed from the calculated defect formation energy resulting in the charge correction proposed by Leslie and Gillan32: E∞ f = Ef(L) + q2vM 2ϵ . (5) In highly ionic materials, defect charge distributions can be described as point like, so this correction is adequate33, however when the defect charge distribution is more diﬀuse the correction of Makov and Payne34 is more appropriate. Castleton and co-workers proposed an extrapolation procedure9,35 for the study of defects in InP whereby the limit of a ﬁt to a series of formation energies obtained from supercells of increasing size was used to determine the formation energy of the isolated defect. However, uniformly scaling all axes simultaneously rapidly increases the number of atoms in the supercell. Consequently it is only computationally feasible to sample the smallest multiplications resulting in too few points to allow a reliable ﬁt to the data. Hine et al. thus suggested an improvement to this scheme based on simulation of supercells comprising diﬀerent multiples of the primitive cell along diﬀerent axes10, with vM calculated separately for each cell. By plotting the defect formation energy as a function of vM and ﬁtting a function of the form Ef (vM) = E∞ f +bvM, it is possible to determine the formation energy of the defect in the dilute limit from the intercept with the y-axis, and an eﬀective permittivity can be extracted from the gradient as b = −q2/2ϵ. The constant vM can be found using Ewald summation36: vM = i̸=0 X Ri erfc \u0010 γ q |Ri| \u0011 |Ri| + i̸=0 X Gi 4π Vc exp (−G2 i /4γ2) G2 i −2γ √π − π Vcγ2.

Fig. 2 shows the formation energy of the V−4 Ti defect as a function of vM for a range of supercell shapes and sizes. The data display a wide variation and it is not possible to extract a single value for E∞ f . The origin of this variation may be deduced by examining subsets of the data. Shown in Fig. 2 are ﬁts of the form Ef (vM) = E∞ f + bvM to defect formation energies calculated in supercells created by extrapolating in the number of repeat units along the b- and c-axes independently, i.e. 2×m×1 (for m= 2,3 and 4) and 2×1×n (for n = 2,3 and 4). As the eﬀective permittivity can be related to the gradient of such a ﬁt it is apparent that there is a diﬀerent level of charge screening present along these crystallographic axes. The eﬀective dielectric constant along b (28.3) is predicted to be more than double that along c (13.4). To account for anisotropy in the screening, the dielectric constant in Eq. 5 must be replaced by a tensor37, denoted ¯ϵ. For a monoclinic crystal such as Li2TiO3 the dielectric tensor has four non-zero components, as shown below38: ¯ϵ =   ϵ11 0 ϵ13 0 ϵ22 0 ϵ13 0 ϵ33  .

In our second approach a function Ef(vM) = −(q2/2)vM + E∞ f is ﬁtted to the defect formation energies determined for a number of diﬀerent cell shapes and sizes. This ﬁtting procedure is slightly unusual as it is the values in the x-axis that are modiﬁed by optimising the elements of ¯ϵeﬀ. Optimised values of E∞ f and the associated elements of ¯ϵeﬀwere obtained using a Nelder-Mead simplex algorithm41. III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION The dielectric tensor for Li2TiO3 was calculated using DFPT and the norm-conserving pseudo-potentials. The results, presented in Table II; show that there is indeed a signiﬁcant level of anisotropy in the dielectric tensor. Examining only the principal (diagonal) elements of ¯ϵDFPT we can see that the magnitude of ϵeﬀ 33 is less than half that of ϵeﬀ 11 and ϵeﬀ 22. Taking the tensor average gives a value of 30.5, which can be compared to a value of 24 for a polycrys- talline Li2TiO3 sample42 (this value has been corrected to represent the theoretical density). The discrepancy between the experimental and theoretical dielectric properties may arise due to the inherent inability of DFT simulations to accurately reproduce experimentally observed band gaps. The values also deviate from those predicted by examining the subsets of the uncorrected data determined from Fig. 2. Corrections such as that of Makov-Payne34 are often performed with ϵ obtained from either DFPT or experiment. Fig. 3 shows defect formation energies for V−4 Ti for a selection of supercells as a function of vscr M , employing ¯ϵDFPT. The data points show that while the level of scatter present in Fig. 2 has been reduced there is also a poor adherence to the linear relationship with gradient −q2/2 expected from Eq. 5. This discrepancy arises as the use of the dielectric tensor calculated for the perfect cell, which thus neglects the atomic relaxations and the consequent modiﬁcation of the local screening in the vicinity of the defect. The modiﬁcation of the dielectric properties of the supercell is further supported", "page": 7, "position": 0}

IV. CONCLUSIONS In summary, we have proposed an extension of the Madelung extrapolation procedure10 for the calculation of defect formation energies in the dilute limit. This is achieved by incorporating the eﬀect of charge screening, via the dielectric tensor, into the calculation of the Madelung potential (via Eq. 8) and ﬁtting the elements of the tensor and the desired dilute-limit formation energy to defect formation energies calculated in a range of supercells. We have applied the method to Li2TiO3, which has a monoclinic structure and a highly anisotropic dielectric tensor, and demonstrated its ability to determine defect formation energies converged to within around 0.1 eV even for such systems. In principle this method is applicable to systems of any shape and dielectric properties. Even in cubic supercells, local relaxation, such as that arising from defect clusters, may break the crystal symmetry such that the dielectric properties are anisotropic, necessitating a tensor representation of dielectric properties. We have also further highlighted the importance of incorporating the eﬀect of lattice relaxation on the dielectric properties of the material when applying a ﬁnite- size correction method based on the Makov-Payne34 approximation.
