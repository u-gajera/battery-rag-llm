Smith, Francisca Sagredo, and Kieron Burke Abstract Density functional theory (DFT) has become the most popular approach to electronic structure across disciplines, especially in material and chemical sci- ences. Last year, at least 30,000 papers used DFT to make useful predictions or give insight into an enormous diversity of scientiﬁc problems, ranging from bat- tery development to solar cell efﬁciency and far beyond. The success of this ﬁeld has been driven by usefully accurate approximations based on known exact condi- tions and careful testing and validation. In the last decade, applications of DFT in a new area, warm dense matter, have exploded. DFT is revolutionizing simulations of warm dense matter including applications in controlled fusion, planetary interiors, and other areas of high energy density physics. Over the past decade or so, molec- ular dynamics calculations driven by modern density functional theory have played a crucial role in bringing chemical realism to these applications, often (but not al- ways) with excellent agreement with experiment. This chapter summarizes recent work from our group on density functional theory at non-zero temperatures, which we call thermal DFT. We explain the relevance of this work in the context of warm dense matter, and the importance of quantum chemistry to this regime. We illustrate many basic concepts on a simple model system, the asymmetric Hubbard dimer. Justin C.

Clas- sical (or semiclassical) plasma physics is accurate for sufﬁciently high temperatures and sufﬁciently diffuse matter[I04]. The name WDM implies too cool and too dense for such methods to be accurate, and this regime has often been referred to as the malfunction junction, because of its difﬁculty[DOE09]. Many excellent schemes have been developed over the decades within plasma physics for dealing with the variety of equilibrium and non-equilibrium phenomena accessed by both people and nature under the relevant conditions[BL04]. These include DFT at the Thomas- Fermi level (for very high temperatures) and use of the local density approximation (LDA) within Kohn-Sham (KS) DFT at cold to moderate temperatures (at very high temperatures, sums over unoccupied orbitals fail to converge). The LDA can in- clude thermal XC corrections based on those of the uniform gas, for which simple parametrizations have long existed[SD13b; KSDT14]. Electronic structure theory: On the other hand, condensed matter physicists, quantum chemists, and computational materials scientists have an enormously well- developed suite of methods for performing electronic structure calculations at tem- peratures at which the electrons are essentially in their ground-state (GS), say, 10,000K or less[B12]. The starting point of many (but not all) such calculations is the KS method of DFT for treating the electrons[KS65]. Almost all such calcu- lations are within the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, and ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) is a standard technique, in which KS-DFT is used for the elec- tronic structure, while Newton’s equations are solved for the ions[CP85]. DFT in WDM: In the last decade or so, standard methods from the electronic structure of materials have had an enormous impact in warm dense matter, where AIMD is often called QMD, quantum molecular dynamics[GDRT14]. Typically a standard code such as VASP is run to perform MD[KRDM08]. In WDM, the tem- peratures are", "page": 1, "position": 0}

Typically a standard code such as VASP is run to perform MD[KRDM08]. In WDM, the tem- peratures are a noticeable fraction of the Fermi energy, and thus the generalization of DFT to thermal systems must be used. Such simulations are computationally demanding but they have the crucial feature of including realistic chemical struc- ture, which is difﬁcult to include with any other method while remaining compu- tationally feasible. Moreover, they are in principle exact[M65; KS65], if the ex- act temperature-dependent exchange-correlation free energy could be used because of Mermin’s theorem establishing thermal DFT(thDFT). In practice, some stan- dard ground-state approximation is usually used. (There are also quantum Monte Carlo calculations which are typically even more computationally expensive[MD00; FBEF01; M09b; SBFH11; DM12; SGVB15; DGSM16]. The beauty of the QMD approach is that it can provide chemically realistic simulations at costs that make useful applications accessible[MMPC12].)

Because of these successes, QMD has rapidly become a standard technique in this ﬁeld. Missing temperature dependence: However, the reliability and domain of ap- plicability of QMD calculations are even less well understood than in GS simu- lations. At the equilibrium level of calculation, vital for equations of state under WDM conditions and the calculation of free-energy curves, a standard generalized gradient approximation (GGA) calculation using, e.g., PBE[PBE96], is often (but not always) deemed sufﬁcient, just as it is for many GS materials properties. Such a calculation ignores thermal exchange-correlation (XC) corrections, i.e., the changes in XC as the temperature increases, which are related to entropic effects. We be- lieve we know these well for a uniform gas (although see the recent string of QMC papers[SGVB15; DGSM16] and parametrizations[KSDT14]), but such corrections will be unbalanced if applied to a GGA such as PBE. So how big a problem is the neglect of such corrections? (A little) beyond equilibrium: On the other hand, many experimental probes of WDM extract response functions such as electrical or thermal conductivity[MD06]. These are always calculated from the equilibrium KS orbitals, albeit at ﬁnite tem- perature. Work on molecular electronics shows that such evaluations suffer both from inaccuracies in the positions of KS orbitals due to deﬁciencies in XC approx- imations, and also require further XC corrections, even if the exact equilibrium XC functional were used[TFSB05; QVCL07; KCBC08].

They start with the many-body Hamiltonian ˆH = ˆT + ˆVee + ˆV, (1) where ˆT, ˆVee, and ˆV are the kinetic, electron-electron, and potential energy opera- tors, respectively. Assuming a non-degenerate ground-state, they proved by reductio ad absurdum that the external potential, v(r) is a unique functional of the density ρ(r), and therefore all observables are also density functionals. More directly Levy deﬁnes the functional F[ρ] = min Ψ→ρ⟨Ψ| ˆT + ˆVee|Ψ⟩, (2) whereΨ is normalized and antisymmetric, and uses it to deﬁne the energy functional Ev[ρ] = F[ρ]+ Z d3rv(r)ρ(r), (3) whose minimization over normalized non-negative densities with ﬁnite kinetic en- ergy yields the ground-state energy and density[L81]. Kohn-Sham scheme: In 1965, Mermin generalized the Hohenberg-Kohn theo- rems for electrons in the grand canonical potential with ﬁxed non-zero temperature τ and chemical potential µ[M65]. Later in 1965, Kohn and Sham created an exact method to construct the universal functional (see Eq. (6)). The Kohn-Sham scheme imagines a system of N non-interacting electrons that yield the electronic density of the original interacting N electron system. These ﬁctitious electrons sit in a new external potential called the KS potential. The KS scheme is written as a set of equations that must be solved self-consistently: \u001a −1 2∇2 +vS(r) \u001b φi(r) = εiφi(r), ρ(r) = N ∑ i |φi(r)|2, (4) vS(r) = v(r)+vH(r)+vXC(r), vXC(r) = δEXC[ρ] δρ(r) , (5) where φi(r) and εi are the KS orbitals and energies, vH(r) is the classical Hartree potential, and vXC(r) is the exchange-correlation potential deﬁned by the unknown XC energy, EXC, in Eq. (5). These must be solved self-consistently since the Hartree potential and EXC depend explicitly on the density. Lastly, the total energy can be found via F[ρ] = TS[ρ]+UH[ρ]+EXC[ρ] (6) where TS is the kinetic energy of the KS electrons and UH is the Hartree energy. In practice, an approximation to EXC must be supplied. There exists a wealth of approximations for EXC[MOB12].", "page": 3, "position": 0}

We can imagine going up a ladder by adding in more ingredients (like gradients of the den- sity[PBE96]) and obeying different or additional conditions to make more compli- cated and more accurate functionals[PRCS09]. For the exact EXC, these equations have been proven to converge[WSBW13]. 2.2 Asymmetric Hubbard dimer and its relevance Throughout this chapter we illustrate results with the simplest interesting model of an interacting system. This model is the asymmetric Hubbard dimer[CFSB15]. The Hubbard dimer crosses the divide between the weakly and strongly correlated communities. Previous work has shown that the basic concepts of ground-state KS- DFT apply to this model and here we demonstrate similar applicability to thermal DFT. The Hamiltonian is given by ˆH = −t∑ σ (ˆc† 1σ ˆc2σ +H.c.)+ 2 ∑ i=1 (U ˆni↑ˆni↓+vi ˆni) (8) where ˆc† iσ(ˆciσ) are electron creation (annihilation) operators and ˆniσ = ˆc† iσ ˆciσ are number operators. t is the strength of electron hopping between sites, U is the ultra- short range Coulomb repulsion for when both electrons are on the same site, and vi is the on-site external potential. We choose, without loss of generality, v1 +v2 = 0 then ∆v = v2 −v1 and the occupation difference, the analog of density, is ∆n = n2 −n1. In Fig. 1 we plot the density ∆n versus asymmetry ∆v in the Hubbard dimer. The Hohenberg-Kohn theorem applies to this Hamiltonian, and guarantees ∆n(∆v) is an invertible function for any value of U. The main physics is a competition between asymmetry and interaction strength. The weakly correlated regime is U < ∆v and the opposite is strong correlation. Increasing ∆v pushes the electrons onto a single site, thus ∆n approaches 2. Likewise, for small ∆v or large U the electrons are apart and ∆n tends to 0. This is made most clear by the extreme cases, i.e., |∆nU=0(∆v)| = 2∆v/ q (2t)2 +∆v2, |∆nU→∞(∆v)| →2θ(∆v−U). (9) The ability to", "page": 4, "position": 0}

The HK theorem guarantees that each function is invertible. There is a simple analytic result for U = 0, and for large U, the relation tends toward a (smoothed) step function, with the step at ∆v = U. 2.3 Ensemble DFT as a route to excitation energies In this section we take a quick aside to overview ensemble DFT (eDFT), a close cousin of thermal DFT. Excitations in DFT: Although time-dependent DFT (TDDFT) is the standard method used to determine the excited states of a system [M16], there are still many deﬁciencies, due to crude approximations to the XC functional as well as being un- able to approximate multiple excitations, charge transfer excitations, canonical in- tersections, and polarizabilities of long-chain polymers; all things that can be impor- tant for photochemistry[MZCB04; DWH03; T03; LKQM06; FBLB02]. Ensemble DFT is a time-independent alternative to the standard TDDFT that can be a useful method for extracting excited states. Naturally, since eDFT and TDDFT are based on two different fundamental theories, it is possible to use eDFT on different sys- tems to those of the traditional method and expect different successes and likewise different failures. Ensemble variational principle: eDFT is based on a variational principle made up of ensembles of ground and excited states [T79]. These ensembles are made of decreasing weights, with the ground state always having the highest weight. Ew ≤ M−1 ∑ k=0 wk⟨Ψk| ˆH|Ψk⟩, w0 ≥w1 ≥... ≥wk ≥0 (10) where allΨk are normalized, antisymmetric, and mutually orthogonal, w = (w0,w1,...wk), and the sum of all weights is 1.

(11) Just as in the ground-state case, a one-to-one correspondence from the weighted density to the potential can be established [GOK88], and applying this to a non- interacting system of the same weighted density can be used to construct a KS eDFT. From this KS system it is in principle possible to extract the exact excited states of the system. Relation to thermal DFT: The connection to thermal DFT is natural and straight forward. Thermal DFT is a special case of eDFT. In thDFT, one chooses the ensem- ble to be the grand canonical ensemble with the usual Boltzmann factors for the weights. However, unlike eDFT, the weights themselves depend on the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian, including the strength of the interaction. Thus the weights in the KS system are different from those of the interacting system. In most applications of eDFT, the weights are chosen to be the same in both the physical and non-interacting systems. History: Ensemble DFT was originally proposed by Gross-Olivera-Kohn in 1988[GOK88], but, like thermal DFT, there has been slow progress over the last 30 years due to a lack of useful approximations to the XC functional. Many of these difﬁculties arise from the so-called ghost interaction errors that occur in the Hartree energy[GPG96]. More speciﬁcally these ghost-interaction errors appear when only using the ground state deﬁnition of the Hartree energy, which causes unphysical contributions and must therefore be accounted for by using a more accurate deﬁni- tion of the Hartree energy for ensembles[PYTB14; YTPB14]. Recent progress: More recently, work has been done to extract the weight de- pendence of the KS eigenvalues, which are required in order to extract accurate transition frequencies[PYTB14; YTPB14]. It was also found that a large cancella- tion of the weight-dependence occurs in the exact ensembles. Further, a new numer- ical method for inverting ensemble densities was derived for spherically symmetric systems, and this method was also tested for cylindrically symmetric systems. This inversion of densities to extract potentials provides a useful test of eDFT approxi- mations.", "page": 6, "position": 0}

This inversion of densities to extract potentials provides a useful test of eDFT approxi- mations. Recent work combines linear interpolation with an extrapolation method in eDFT to extract excited states that are independent of ensemble weights[SHMK16]. Also, an exact analytical expression for the exchange energy was derived, and a general- ized adiabatic connection for ensembles (GACE) was used to connect the ensemble XC functional with the ground state functional[DMF16]. Finally, a ghost interaction correction has been developed for range-separated eDFT[AKF16]. A simple exercise: Here we show an example of the importance of the weight- dependence of functionals in eDFT, in a seemingly simple system. We put only one electron in the Hubbard dimer, so there is no interaction, and its a simple tight- binding Hamiltonian. We will derive the exact kinetic energy functional, which is an example of the non-interacting KS kinetic energy functional. We will also ap- proximate it, as if we were interested in orbital-free eDFT.", "page": 6, "position": 1}

Thus we can make only a bi-ensemble. The ensemble-weighted ground-state density is ∆nw = (1−w)∆n0 +w∆n1 = (1−2w)∆n0(x), (12) where ∆n0, and ∆n1 correspond to the occupational difference of the two sites for the ground and ﬁrst-excited state, respectively, and ∆n0(x) is given by Eq. (9) with U = 0. This last result is true only because ∆n1 = −∆n0 in this simple model. The weight as previously stated is w ≤0.5. Similarly, the kinetic energy for a single particle in the ground-state is known, and TS,1 = −TS,0, so T w S = (1−w)TS,0 +wTS,1 = (1−2w)TS,0 = (1−2w) −1 2 √ 1+x2 (13) where x = ∆v/(2t). Using V w = ∆v∆nw/2 and adding it to T w S yields the ensemble energy, which is exactly linear in w, and passes through E0 at w = 0 and (would pass through) E1 at w = 1. This simple linearity with w is true by construction of the ensemble, when en- ergies are plotted against w for a ﬁxed potential. But now we show that things get complicated when we consider them as density functionals. Inverting the relation between potentials and densities we ﬁnd x = ∆nw p (−∆nw)2 +(1−2w)2 (14) and inserting this into the kinetic energy yields T w S [∆n] = q −(∆n)2 +(1−2w)2/2 (15) Even in this trivial case, the the w-dependence of the kinetic energy density func- tional is non-linear. Next, we make the most naive approximation, namely to replace T w S [∆n] with its ground-state counterpart. This yields an approximate eDFT theory from which, in principle, we can estimate the energy of the ﬁrst excited state. To do this, we in- sert the exact w-dependent density of Eq. (12) into the ground-state functional, add the exact V w, and plot the resulting energy. The exact and approximate results are shown in Fig. 2. The approximation is very bad, yielding an excited state energy of about −0.3 instead of 0.71, by using the", "page": 7, "position": 0}

Notice that w = 0 corresponds to E0, which is 1/ √ 2 in these units. 2.4 Thermal DFT in a nutshell Mermin-Kohn-Sham equations: In a thermal system, Eq. (4) and (5) are general- ized such that the density and XC potential become ρτ(r) and vτ XC(r), i.e. tempera- ture dependent, and EXC[ρ] in Eq. (5) becomes Aτ XC[ρ], the exchange-correlation free energy density functional. The density becomes ρτ(r) = ∑ i fi|φ τ i (r)|2 (16) where the sum is now over all states and fi = (1 + e(ετ i −µ)/τ)−1, the Fermi occu- pation factors. One of the core difﬁculties in thermal DFT calculations is this sum, since a huge number of states are required once the temperature is sufﬁciently high. This leads to large computational demands and convergence issues. We call these the Mermin-Kohn-Sham equations. To extract the total free energy from the MKS equations, we write Aτ[ρ] = Aτ S[ρ]−UH[ρ]+Aτ XC[ρ]− Z d3rρ(r)vτ XC[ρ](r), (17) where the MKS free energy is Aτ S[ρ] = ∑ i ετ i [ρ]−τSτ S[ρ], Sτ S[ρ] = −∑ i [fi log(fi)+(1−fi)log(1−fi)], (18) and SS is the MKS entropy.", "page": 8, "position": 0}

In active use are two approxima- tions: thermal LDA (thLDA) and the Zero-Temperature Approximation (ZTA). The former uses the temperature-dependent XC free energy of the uniform gas instead of its ground-state analog in Eq. (7). The ZTA means simply using any ground-state XC functional instead of a temperature-dependent one. We denote use of the exact ground-state XC functional as exact ZTA (EZTA). Fig. 3 Effects of temperature on the on-site occupations as a function of on-site potential difference for U = 1 and 5 in the asymmetric Hubbard dimer (see Sec. 3.2) with and without temperature. Increasing temperature pushes the electrons towards opposite sites and lowers ∆n while increasing ∆v pushes electrons to the same site and raises ∆n. In Fig. 3 we demonstrate the effects of turning on temperature for the Hubbard dimer (see Sec. 3.2 for more information). Even a small increase in temperature can have a big impact on a system regardless of the strength of correlation. 3 Some recent developments in thermal DFT The formalism for thermal DFT was originally developed alongside that of ground- state DFT, but in the intervening decades ground-state DFT (and TDDFT, for that matter) has received signiﬁcantly more attention and consequently more develop- ments[WGB05; B12]. However, In the past couple decades thermal DFT has seen more use, and with that much more development in the past ten years. In this section we outline some recent developments to thermal DFT from our group.", "page": 9, "position": 0}

These conditions take many forms with some common examples being coordinate and interaction scaling conditions[LP85], and bounds on the XC energy[LO81]. There are well over a dozen conditions in ground-state DFT (a recent meta-GGA functional even uses seventeen[SRP15]!), but the use of exact conditions is much more nascent in thermal DFT. 3.1.1 Coordinate-temperature scaling and the thermal connection formula Uniform coordinate scaling: The most straightforward application of exact con- ditions to thermal DFT is by uniform scaling of the density[LP85]. The very basic conditions that this procedure generates in ground-state DFT are built in to almost all modern approximations. In a sense, this is simply dimensional analysis, but while keeping the density ﬁxed (which is the tricky bit). Early work on exact conditions for thermal DFT[PPFS11; PPGB13] derived ba- sic conditions such as the signs of correlation quantities, including the separation into kinetic and potential contributions, and the adiabatic connection formula at ﬁnite temperature. More conditions come from coordinate scaling of the density, showing that is intimately related to temperature dependence. Examples of a few of these conditions are Fτ S [ρ] = γ2Fτ/γ2 S [ρ1/γ], Sτ S[ρ] = Sτ/γ2 S [ρ1/γ], Aτ X[ρ] = γAτ/γ2 X [ρ1/γ], (19) where ργ(r) = γ3ρ(γr). For any of these functionals, this means that, if you know the functional at any one ﬁnite temperature, the functional at all possible tempera- tures is available via scaling of the density. New formulas: In recent work, many new formulas relating correlation compo- nents of the energy to one another were derived[PB16], such as Kτ,λ C [ρ] = Aτ,λ C [ρ]−λ dAτ,λ C [ρ] dλ , (20) where Kτ,λ C [n] = T τ,λ C [ρ] −τSτ,λ C [ρ] is the correlation kentropy. There was also a rewriting of the adiabatic connection formula[PPFS11; LP75], using the relation to scaling mentioned above, yielding the XC free energy at temperature τ: Aτ XC[ρ]", "page": 10, "position": 0}

A second set of formulas give the many relations among the differ- ent correlation energy components (total, potential, and kentropic). These are very important in ground-state DFT[FTB00; PEB96] for understanding the origins of different physical contributions to the correlation free energy and have guided the construction of many approximations. Entropy: Lastly for this section, we look at a new set of exact conditions for the electronic entropy as a functional of the density[BSGP16]. The most important is that the universal functional can be written solely in terms of a temperature integral over entropy, such as Fτ[ρ] = F0[ρ]− Z τ 0 dτ′ Sτ′[n], Aτ XC[ρ] = EXC[ρ]− Z τ 0 dτ′ Sτ′ XC[ρ], (22) i.e., the universal contribution to the free energy functional is a simple integral over the electronic entropy, and the second shows that all thermal corrections to the XC free energy are given by an integral over the XC entropy. These formulas have no analog in ground-state DFT. They also lead to fundamental inequalities on the vari- ous thermal derivatives of both interacting and KS quantities. Such conditions have long been known for the uniform gas[I82], but our results are their generalization to inhomogeneous systems. Analogs are also easily derived from statistical mechan- ics, but again, the tricky part is to deduce their behavior as functionals of the density rather than the external potential. This is why, for example, all derivatives are total with respect to temperature. The particle number is ﬁxed by the density, so temper- ature is the sole remaining variable. Our work uses the formalism and methods of ground-state DFT, generalized to ﬁnite temperature, but the same results can also be extracted in the language of statistical mechanics[DT11; DT16]. Tiny violations: A minor illustration of the relevance of these conditions is that we found that a recent parameterization of the thermal XC free energy of the uni- form gas[KSDT14]", "page": 11, "position": 0}

Tiny violations: A minor illustration of the relevance of these conditions is that we found that a recent parameterization of the thermal XC free energy of the uni- form gas[KSDT14] violates one of our conditions for low densities[BSGP16]. This violation is slight, and unlikely to ever inﬂuence the results of any thLDA calcula- tion. Nonetheless, it is always better to build parameterizations that satisfy known conditions, so that the corresponding approximate calculations are guaranteed to satisfy such conditions[SGVB15; DGSM16]. Zero-temperature approximations: This work also showed that any ZTA cal- culation automatically satisﬁes most of our conditions, whereas the inclusion of thermal XC corrections risks violating them for speciﬁc systems. For example, all approximations in Fig. 5 (discussed below) are guaranteed to satisfy these con- ditions.

There are large databases of molecular properties, based either on highly reliable and accurate experimental measurements, or on far more ac- curate quantum chemical calculations[SGB97; ZKP98; KPB99; TS09]. But these databases usually contain at most a few numbers per system, such as the atom- ization energy and bond length(s). A substantially more sophisticated test occurs when a highly accurate calculation is performed such as QMC[CKB79; NU99] or DMRG[W92], and an inversion of the KS equations[SV09], so that essentially exact KS potentials, eigenvalues, orbitals, etc, can all be deduced. This is a much more powerful test of a DFT approximation, and usually provides detailed insight into its limitations. The QMC calculations of Umrigar and collaborators[UG94; FUT94; HU97] and their high impact, testify to this fact. Difﬁculty of exact thermal calculations: Although almost all practical calcu- lations of WDM are in a condensed phase (with hot ions), almost all high level inversions yielding exact KS quantities are for atoms or small molecules. But even for such systems, it is difﬁcult to imagine accurate inversions at ﬁnite temperature, as only the average particle number is ﬁxed, and all possible particle numbers must be considered. Exact calculations for Hubbard dimer: Exact calculations are only possible for this model because the Hilbert space is severely truncated which allows us to compute all energies analytically (see Fig. 4 for complete diagram of the energy spectrum). However, this means the model is not even a qualitatively realistic rep- resentation of very high temperatures (though we choose parameters such that the ceiling of the Hilbert space does not effect results). But we are able to do the inver- sion exactly, and so extract all the different contributions to X and C as a function of both τ and U. These are the ﬁrst exact inversions of an interacting system at ﬁnite", "page": 12, "position": 0}

These are the ﬁrst exact inversions of an interacting system at ﬁnite temperature. They show us the structure of the underlying functionals, but cannot tell us which approximations will be accurate. For example, there is no real analog of LDA for this system (although BALDA[LSOC03] somewhat plays this role). Paradox: To see why such simplistic calculations are important, consider the bottom panel of Fig. 5. The black line shows the exact density difference in the dimer versus temperature for moderate correlation and asymmetry. The blue curve is a Hartree-Fock calculation, while the red curve adds in the high-density limit of GS correlation. Finally, EZTA in green uses the exact GS functional (i.e. the best possible ZTA), which we had already found in Ref. [CFSB15], in the MKS equa- tions, which therefore is the best possible calculation that ignores thermal XC con- tributions. By construction, this becomes exact in the zero-temperature limit. But, to our surprise, we found that the relative error in the free energy and density vanishes in the high temperature limit. In fact, as temperature increases, the fractional errors at ﬁrst increase, and then start to lessen. Resolution of paradox: How can this counterintuitive result be right? The an- swer is very simple. For high temperatures, the XC components of the energy remain", "page": 12, "position": 1}

The triplet for N = 2 is always at E = 0 due to symmetry. The top left is symmetric and weakly correlated, so the spectral lines are close to the dashed ones.

In the lower left panel, we turn on asymmetry, and show that it lessens the effects of U shown in the upper panels. ﬁnite (and actually shrink, see Fig. 6), while the KS contributions grow, at least in this simple case. Thus any XC approximation will produce the same effect. This is why all the approximations merge onto the exact line in Fig. 5 for sufﬁciently high temperatures. Of course, there can still be a signiﬁcant absolute error in the free en- ergy which might have important effects on quantities of interest. But the principle is clear: EZTA becomes relatively exact in both the low- and high-temperature lim- its. This is also trivially true for the uniform gas, once the (inﬁnite) Hartree energy is included, and we suspect it to be true for all systems. Relevance for response functions: The increasing accuracy of the density with temperature has very important implications for calculations of conductivity. This means that the error in the KS orbitals, used in the construction of KS conductivities, starts to decrease beyond some temperature. This is true for any GS approximation for XC (within reason). All these conclusions may explain the tremendous success so far gotten by ignoring the thermal XC effects, especially for conductivities.", "page": 13, "position": 0}

TDDFT in particular[RG84] can handle both strong pertur- bations, such as atoms and molecules in intense laser ﬁelds, and weak perturba- tions, where the linear response formulation yields excitation energies and oscillator strengths[BWG05]. General case too difﬁcult: Unfortunately, the situation is very complicated if the perturbation is strong, as then a non-equilibrium treatment is needed. Theories in which the temperature is held ﬁxed do not apply. This is the situation for example in calculations of stopping power[GSK96]. There are many ﬁne attempts to overcome these difﬁculties under a variety of practically useful conditions[RTKC16], but we have not seen a way to construct a general DFT treatment of such problems. Linear response: For a ﬁnite system (which has to be very carefully deﬁned in the thermal case), we proved a limited theorem for the linear density response to a time-dependent external ﬁeld[PGB16]. This proof allows for (ﬁnite numbers of) degeneracies in the excited states, but not in the equilibrium state. Armed with such a theorem, all the usual XC response properties, such as the XC kernel, can be deﬁned at ﬁnite temperature. Combined with our thermal connection formula, we have the ﬁnite-temperature generalization of the Gross-Kohn response equation[GK85]: χτ(12) = χτ S (12)+ Z d3d4χτ S (13)f τ HXC(34)χτ(42), (23) where 1 denotes the coordinates r,t, and 2 another pair[KBP94], χτ(12) is the density-density response function at temperature τ, χS its KS counterpart, and f τ HXC(12) the thermal Hartree-XC kernel. This becomes the Random Phase Approx- imation (RPA) when fXC = 0. Insertion of this into the thermal connection formula yields an RPA-type equation for the XC free energy[PGB16]: Aτ XC[ρ] = lim τ′′→∞ τ 2 Z τ′′ τ dτ′ τ′2 Z ∞ 0 dω 2π coth \u0012 ω 2τ \u0013Z dr Z dr′ ℑχτ′[ργ](r,r′,ω) |r−r′| .

Accurate thermal conductivities for inertial conﬁnement fusion fuel materi- als such as deuterium and tritium are needed to ﬁnd the calculated total neutron yield in fusion science (the simulated mixing between the fuel and coating on ICF capsules is very sensitive to thermal conductivities)[HCBK14]. Accurate iron ther- mal conductivities are used to determine whether the conventional model for how the Earth’s core developed is valid because heat ﬂux contributes to the Earth’s geo- magnetic ﬁeld. Differential heating experiments at ALS, LCLS, Omega, and Titan facilities are all done slightly differently (heating via optical lasers, XFEL, x-rays, or proton heating), to ﬁt hydrodynamics models because of their high accuracy and because other approaches (SESAME, Purgatorio, and Lee-More) all differ[BJKR78; LM84; WSSI06]. Our work suggesting that ignoring XC thermal corrections nev- ertheless yields accurate KS eigenstates and eigenvalues[SPB16] helps explain why conductivities can be accurate in these calculations. Much WDM research is motivated by the desire to understand planetary inte- riors. The Juno mission is measuring Jupiter’s gravitational ﬁeld extremely accu- rately, constraining theories of its interior[MGF16], while Kepler has shown that many notions of planetary formation must be rethought with our new data on extra- solar planets[C16]. But there is limited understanding of whether initial planetary protocores remain stable during accretion or if they dissolve into outer metallic hy- drogen layers. Recent DFT-MD calculations show that MgO is surprisingly solu- ble in hydrogen under these conditions[WM12]. Similarly, the moon is thought to have formed in an enormous impact, but such a scenario depends crucially on the equation of state of MgO under extreme conditions. Recent DFT calculations and Z-machine experiments have nailed this EOS more accurately than before, and far better than unreliable extrapolations from more mundane conditions[RSLD15].

Meanwhile, DFT calculations have predicted new superionic phases of H2O, under conditions relevant to Uranus and Neptune interiors[WWM13]. DFT failure: A less successful application of DFT in WDM is to the liquid in- sulator to liquid metal transition in dense D2, at about 1000K and 300 GPa. DFT calculations with several different functionals yield very different results, none of which are in satisfactory agreement with experiment. The interpretation also de- pends on the accuracy of the conductivity from the DFT calculations. This system remains a challenge to WDM simulations. X-ray Thompson scattering: Some of the most exciting recent experiments have been from the LINAC at SLAC, allowing X-ray Thompson scattering (XRTS) measurements of shocked materials. These include the ﬁrst highly resolved mea- surements of the plasmon spectrum in an ultrafast heated solid[SGLC15]. Ref. [DDRF16] gives x-ray scattering results from plasmons in dynamically compressed", "page": 16, "position": 1}

Ionization begins at about the pressure that DFT-MD calculations show molec- ular dissociation. In a completely different material, X-ray diffraction showed dia- mond formation on nanosecond timescales, caused by shock compression to about 200 GPa[KRGG16]. This helps explain why the lonsdaleite crystal structure occurs naturally close to meteor impacts. XRTS has been performed on a variety of materials including Be, Li, C, CH shells, and Al. Most experiments probe the electron dynamic structure factor, which is decomposed via the somewhat ad-hoc Chihara decomposition into bound, loosely bound, and free electrons[BSDH16]. But by running TDDFT at ﬁnite temperatures, one directly calculates the densities, and can then test the accuracy of Chihara for determining the ionization state. The results of Ref. [PGB16] are already being used to justify thTDDFT calculations such as Ref. [BSDH16]. 5 Relation of thermal DFT to quantum chemistry At ﬁrst glance, it would appear that warm dense matter has little or nothing to do with chemistry. In fact, this is not true, it is simply chemistry in an exciting new regime with which we are relatively unfamiliar. To see this, we ﬁrst note that the plasma physicists who usually study WDM think in terms of average properties of their systems, such as mean densities and numbers of electrons ionized. They are familiar with density functional methods, but traditionally only at the level of the LDA. Successes with such an approximation are often attributed to systems being somehow ‘locally uniform’. But the success of DFT methods in chemistry can be directly correlated with the arrival of the GGA and hybrids of it with Hartree-Fock. These approxima- tions were tested on the G2 data set, and shown to yield much better energetics than LDA, because the G2 data set had already been carefully constructed and benchmarked, using both quantum chemical methods and experimental informa- tion[CRRP97; CRRP98; PHMK05].

This vote of conﬁdence led to their widespread adoption in many branches of chemistry, and also led to the conﬁdence that GGAs were better than LDA for many materials problems. It is the same GGAs, used in MD simulations, that have led to the revolution in WDM simulations over the past decade or so[LBKC00]. The improved accuracy due to GGAs implies that the details of the electronic structure matter, and that these systems are in no way locally uniform. In fact, in many cases, there are large evanes- cent regions of the HOMO, just as in gas-phase molecules. The KS system is ideal for computing this, and GGAs and hybrid account for the energetic consequences. So the very success of DFT-MD for WDM implies that the detailed chemistry is vital, even if it is happening within simulations of extended systems under high temperature and pressure. The recent work in our group is almost entirely focused on bringing GGA-level XC technology to the WDM ﬁeld. Being able to distinguish among different com-", "page": 17, "position": 1}

The adiabatic con- nection formula is often invoked in modern DFT research to understand both exact DFT and approximations, and its recasting as a temperature integral should prove useful in the search for accurate thermal XC approximations. On the other hand, ground-state DFT has beneﬁted enormously from testing on benchmark data[SGB97; ES99]. But for thermal effects, even a simple H atom is difﬁcult, as one must include sums over all possible particle numbers in the parti- tion function. The asymmetric Hubbard dimer is the simplest imaginable exactly- solvable model, and can be considered a model for H2 in a minimal basis. While the truncated Hilbert space makes it unrealistic at higher temperatures, it also makes it practical to solve exactly. Thus our calculations on this model demonstrate the be- havior of correlation at ﬁnite temperatures in one simple case. Unfortunately, due to the lack of a continuum, this cannot be used to check the performance of LDA or GGA. Thermodynamics tells us simple relations between entropy and free energy and other quantities. But it requires very careful reasoning to deduce the correspond- ing relations among density functionals, as the density must be held ﬁxed, not the external potential. Our relations between entropy and the universal part of the Mer- min functional show this, and subtraction of the corresponding KS contributions yields crucial relations among correlation contributions. They also yield simple in- equalities that are not automatically satisﬁed once thermal XC contributions are approximated. Lastly, the recent proof of TDDFT for ﬁnite temperatures within linear response justiﬁes the extraction of conductivities within the Kubo response formalism from KS orbitals and energies. It also shows that the random-phase approximation, which is now routinely calculated for inhomogeneous systems in many codes in both quan- tum chemistry and materials science[KF96; F01; F08; EYF10; EBF12; F16], might be an excellent starting point for more accurate approximations to", "page": 18, "position": 0}

Finally, our recent work explains how ignoring thermal XC effects, which is usu- ally done in practical DFT WDM calculations, might not be as poor an approxi- mation as it ﬁrst appears. Calculations on the Hubbard dimer show that XC effects become relatively less important as the temperature increases. Thus the errors in the self-consistent density and orbitals caused by any approximation to the XC lessen with increasing temperature, so that calculations of the KS conductance should be more accurate as temperature increases (somewhat counterintuitively). To summarize, the success of modern density functional approximations in WDM simulations strongly implies the importance of chemical phenomena in such simulations, and the need to accurately approximate the energetics.", "page": 18, "position": 1}
