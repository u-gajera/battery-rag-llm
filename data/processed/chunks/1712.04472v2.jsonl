Speciﬁcally, we generate Gaussian approximation potential (GAP) models for the interaction of lithium atoms with graphene, graphite, and disordered carbon nanostructures, based on reference density- functional theory (DFT) data. Rather than treating the full Li–C system, we demonstrate how the energy and force diﬀerences arising from Li intercalation can be modeled and then added to a (prexisting and unmodiﬁed) GAP model of pure elemental carbon. Furthermore, we show the beneﬁt of using an explicit pair potential ﬁt to capture “eﬀective” Li–Li interactions, to improve the performance of the GAP model. This provides proof-of-concept for modeling guest atoms in host frameworks with machine-learning based potentials, and in the longer run is promising for carrying out detailed atomistic studies of battery materials. I. INTRODUCTION Understanding and controlling the atomistic processes during charging and discharging of batteries is a key re- quirement for developing next-generation energy-storage solutions. Among the most abundant technologies to- day are lithium (Li) ion batteries in which the cath- ode is typically a complex oxide, whereas the anode is most commonly made of graphite or other carbonaceous nanostructures.1–3 Intercalation mechanisms and reactiv- ity of Li in these materials have been widely studied using a range of experimental techniques.4–6 In today’s battery-materials research, ﬁrst-principles computations are routinely used to complement exper- iments and even to make predictions, usually based on density-functional theory (DFT).7–10 On the anode side, fundamental DFT studies have dealt with both the pris- tine intercalation compound LiC6 (e.g., Refs. 11 and 12) and with Li adsorption on pristine and defective graphene.13–20 For example, in Ref.", "page": 0, "position": 0}

Due to the computational cost and scaling behavior of DFT, all these simulations are restricted to relatively small systems, up to a few hundred atoms at most and short time scales. This can be feasible when studying a well-deﬁned unit cell (such as in many crystalline ox- ide cathode materials),9 but becomes very problematic when attempting to simulate disordered or even amor- phous systems (such as carbon nanostructures in an- a)Electronic mail: vld24@cam.ac.uk odes), which require large simulation cells. In princi- ple, empirical interatomic potentials, which are much less computationally demanding, can be used to describe metal atoms in complex environments.21 For example, an Li–C parameter set has been developed for the widely used reactive force ﬁeld (ReaxFF):22 this method has been applied to fracture and failure mechanisms of car- bonaceous electrodes in the presence of Li,23,24 and, more recently, in a new implementation, to Li clusters aggre- gating on graphene surfaces.25 Very recently, ReaxFF was combined with neutron diﬀraction and pair distribu- tion function analysis to trace Li atoms in carbonaceous anode materials in real space.26 Nonetheless, inherent challenges remain for any em- pirical interatomic potential.

We show how Gaussian approximation potential (GAP) models can be generated by ﬁtting to the energy and force diﬀerences that Li atoms induce in graphitic and amorphous carbon structures. Rather than focusing on ideal graphite alone, we aim for transferability and therefore include a large number of disordered and higher-energy structures. We analyze the accuracy limits of any diﬀerence-based inter- atomic potential with a ﬁnite cutoﬀradius, validate our GAP model against DFT reference data, and discuss the application to molecular-dynamics (MD) simulations. arXiv:1712.04472v2 [cond-mat.mtrl-sci] 13 Feb 2018", "page": 0, "position": 2}

Machine-learning-based potentials: a brief overview To overcome the limits both of DFT methods and empirical interatomic potentials, a popular strategy in condensed-phase simulations is to “machine-learn” from DFT reference data and subsequently use this to con- struct a computationally much faster potential. These ML methods perform a high-dimensional ﬁt to the DFT potential-energy surface for a limited set of preselected conﬁgurations and then interpolate energies and forces for other structures of interest. In contrast to empiri- cal potentials (which are also often ﬁtted to DFT data), ML models impose no particular functional form and so can fully ﬂexibly adapt to data; this avoids bias in construction, but also requires careful ﬁtting and test- ing to rule out unphysical behavior. Over recent years, ML-based interatomic potentials using artiﬁcial neural networks,30–37 Gaussian process regression,38–40 or other algorithms41–47 have been attracting growing interest. They were successfully used to describe complex atom- istic processes, such as the crystallization of the phase- change material GeTe48–50 or various high-pressure phase transitions in elemental solids.51–53 The ability to reach close-to-DFT accuracy at much lower computational cost makes them particularly promising tools for studying dis- ordered and amorphous systems.40,48 The current state of the ﬁeld has been reviewed, for example, in Refs. 54 and 55. Notwithstanding their usefulness, ML-based inter- atomic potentials face challenges as well. Among the most central ones is the need for large reference databases of DFT data that cover many very diﬀerent scenarios, such as transition states, defects, and surfaces. This challenge becomes particularly pressing with increasing chemical complexity: for elemental solids, systematic ref- erence databases can be constructed (as discussed, e.g., in Ref. 39), but for binary, ternary, or quaternary chemical systems the complexity grows very quickly. Intercalated atoms represent a special case, which we will discuss in the following. B.

Rather than aiming at an explicit description of the full Li–C binary system, we therefore propose to perform a ﬁt for the energy diﬀerences arising from inserting an Li atom into a C matrix, as sketched in Fig. 1; that is, we seek an ML representation for the intercalation energy ∆EDFT ≡EDFT(LiCx) −EDFT(Cx) −EDFT(Li) (1) as a function of the atomic coordinates involved. In ad- dition, the ﬁrst derivative of the energy diﬀerence yields the force diﬀerence, which makes it feasible to ﬁt a model including forces, and thus increases the amount of avail- able data. The energy for the pure carbon framework, EDFT(Cx), is already accessible through our GAP model for amor- phous carbon.40 The ﬂexibility of this model has been ex- empliﬁed very recently by using it for random structure searching, leading to the identiﬁcation of several hitherto unknown hypothetical carbon allotropes.57 We tested the quality of the initial, pure carbon GAP speciﬁcally for ten", "page": 1, "position": 2}

Hence, using this elemental carbon GAP, we can predict the energy for the pure host framework during a simulation, i.e., we have direct access to EGAP(Cx). Furthermore, the en- ergy of an isolated Li atom, EDFT(Li), is constant and does not need to be part of the ML framework. In this work, we therefore construct a new GAP model for the energy diﬀerence, ∆EDFT, using estab- lished methods which will be described below. Note that while the discussion here focuses on energies for simplic- ity, the overall ﬁtting process involves the forces on atoms as well, and it employs a sparsiﬁcation procedure to se- lect only representative atomic environments from the multitude of conﬁgurations in the reference database.58 A detailed description of the ﬁtting procedure is found in Ref. 59. The ideas outlined here are developed in the GAP framework, but they are expected to be readily trans- ferable to other implementations of ML-based potential ﬁtting. Indeed, while this manuscript was in preparation, we became aware of very recent work by Li et al.,60 who generated a neural-network potential for Cu adatoms in amorphous Ta2O5. In this case, the host structure is ﬁxed (and its energy obtained directly from DFT evalu- ations), but the idea of ﬁtting to energy diﬀerences in- duced by an adatom (there, Cu; here, Li) is very similar.

We have re- cently shown how non-parametric two- and three-body (distance and angle) terms can be combined with a many-body descriptor in the GAP framework;40 this im- proves the robustness of the ﬁt, especially when describ- ing highly disordered liquid and amorphous structures. Our GAP model for Li intercalation uses similar ideas but additionally needs to distinguish Li–C and Li–Li in- teractions, and utilizes a total of four descriptors: • a two-body term for Li–C interactions; • a two-body term for Li–Li interactions; both use the distance between atoms as a simple scalar de- scriptor coordinate; • a three-body term for the angles that an Li atom forms with two neighboring carbon atoms; and ﬁ- nally • a many-body term that includes all C neighbors of a given Li atom, up to a speciﬁed cutoﬀradius, rcut. Summing over these four descriptors as indicated by the superscript “(d)”, each expressed through general vectors q(d), and using a scaling parameter δ(d) for the diﬀerent contributions, gives the ﬁnal expression: ∆EGAP = X d ( δ(d) X i X t α(d) t K(d) \u0010 q(d) i , q(d) t \u0011) , (2) where α(d) t are ﬁtting coeﬃcients, and K(d) is a similarity measure or kernel that compares the i-th environment in the trial structure to the t-th one in the reference dataset (from which Nt points are drawn).

For many-body interactions, we employ the Smooth Overlap of Atomic Positions (SOAP) approach61 that has been previously used for generating GAP models,39,40 for restraining reﬁnements of diﬀraction data,62 and for classifying molecular and condensed-phase structures.63 SOAP expands the neighbor density around a given atom a into a basis set of orthogonal, atom-centered functions, ρa(r) = X nlm c(a) nlm gn(r)Ylm(ˆr), (4) where gn(r) denote radial basis functions and Ylm(ˆr) are spherical harmonics, up to a speciﬁed maximum value of n and l (here, we choose nmax = lmax = 10).

Eﬀective Li–Li potential Up to this point, we have discussed the ﬁtting to energy and force diﬀerences (Eq. 2; Sec. II.B), and we tried to combine this with previous GAP ﬁtting strategies that were successfully used for our elemental carbon model (Sec. II.C).40 However, direct application of these meth- ods did not lead to a satisfactory description of Li–Li dy- namics (see below), and we found an additional method- ological step to be necessary. Despite getting satisfactory ﬁts to ∆EDFT, the source of the problem was traced back to the fact that in terms of absolute value, the largest contribution to ∆EDFT is coming from individual Li insertion energies (typically > 1 eV), but the dynamics of Li atoms is governed to a signiﬁcant extent by Li–Li interactions, which are com- paratively much weaker (typically ∼0.1 eV). This weaker interaction is diﬃcult to tease out from the data. There- fore we introduce an eﬀective Li-Li interaction term, which we calculate with DFT explicitly, and ﬁt directly with a pair potential (we use a two-body GAP term for this). This eﬀective potential is subtracted from the DFT data prior to ﬁtting the rest of the model, and then added back to obtain the full ML model (Fig. 1). Thus, the end result is an accurate ﬁt to ∆EDFT, but which also has an explicit term that is designed to capture eﬀective Li–Li pair interactions, including the long-range behavior, as well as possible. Let us consider a carbon framework in which two Li atoms (“A” and “B”) are intercalated. The total energy of this system, EAB, is accessible via DFT, and we de- compose it into the energy of the Li-free system, Efree, and a number of additional terms induced by the guest atoms: EAB = Efree + δEA + δEB + V Li−Li eﬀ , (8) where δEA and δEB correspond to changes in energy of the system due to the presence of either Li atom on its own, viz.", "page": 3, "position": 0}

The latter were generated by quenching from the melt at diﬀerent densities follow- ing Ref. 40 and using the GAP model introduced there. Single-point DFT computations were performed for all these structures: as we need the energy and force diﬀer- ences for ﬁtting, reference computations for the Li-free structures were also required. To save computational time, one single Li-free structure can be used to generate several structures with one or several Li atoms present. In most cases, we enforced a minimum Li–C distance of 1.5 ˚A in the training data (“hard-sphere constraint”); to accurately describe high-energy structures, we included a small amount of data where the minimum distance was lower, down to 0.70 ˚A. We attempted to sample conﬁg- uration space widely; however, structures in which un- physically high energies (> 20 eV/Li) or forces (> 80 eV ˚A−1) occurred were excluded (after testing several lim- its). The ﬁnal training set contains 561 graphite, 192 graphene, and 1664 amorphous conﬁgurations. Based on these training data, the GAP was ﬁtted in an iterative fashion. We started by a model that only con- tains a two-body descriptor for Li–C interactions, and chose the parameters so as to strike a compromise be- tween accuracy and simplicity (that is, achieving reason- able values for rcut and Nt). Once these were optimized, the next descriptor was added (Table I); this process was repeated until the introduction of new descriptors led to no further improvements.

It is fur- ther known that the description of Li intercalation in graphite can be further improved by higher-level DFT and by Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) methods.66 These are not the target here, however, due to their much higher computational cost, and since the ﬁtting procedure is in- dependent of the underlying DFT methodology. With more computational power available, it should be possi- ble to ﬁt to these quantum-mechanical methods in the future. Single-point energy and force computations were car- ried out using CASTEP,67 following protocols in our pre- vious work.40 Reciprocal space was sampled on meshes", "page": 4, "position": 2}

Pseudopoten- tials were generated on-the-ﬂy, with a plane-wave energy cutoﬀof 650 eV, and a correction for ﬁnite-basis errors was employed.68 To obtain reference data for dynamical properties of interest, viz. radial and bond-angle distributions as well as vibrational densities of states, additional DFT- based MD simulations were performed using the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP),69–71 the projector augmented-wave method,72 and the LDA. In these sim- ulations, the Brillouin zone was sampled at the Γ point, which is standard practice for obtaining long MD tra- jectories. The plane-wave energy cutoﬀwas 500 eV. The temperature was set to 1,000 K and controlled by a Nos´e– Hoover thermostat. MD simulations were performed for 75 ps with a time step of 1 fs; the last 50 ps of the tra- jectories were sampled for analysis. The same or simi- lar settings were chosen for GAP-driven MD simulations wherever possible. IV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION A. Locality and target accuracy Our potential is ﬁtted with the assumption of locality: interactions beyond a given cutoﬀradius are not part of the model, and therefore a natural bound is placed on how accurate any ﬁnite-range potential can be. We have previously demonstrated how locality can be assessed for crystalline and amorphous compounds: by deﬁning a ﬁxed sphere around an atom in a structure, perturbing all atoms outside this sphere, and measuring the forces on the central atom as a function of sphere size.38,40 Here, we are interested in the force diﬀerences due to Li in- sertion, and therefore have an easier way of quantifying locality: we inspect the force components on each carbon atom in a structure with and without a single Li atom intercalated (Fig. 3a), and plot the diﬀerence (for each of the three Cartesian force components individually) as a function of how far this particular atom is away from the intercalated Li. To make the interpretation of the data easier, we col- lect them with a binning interval of 0.25 ˚A and calculate the arithmetic", "page": 5, "position": 0}

The trends with Li–C distance reveal two distinct regimes: up to 2 ˚A, the mean deviation (which we take to indicate the expected force error of the potential) drops steeply but remains very high, as this is the region of strong Li–C in- teractions, not of typical cutoﬀradii. From 2 ˚A onwards, the mean still declines, indicating a remaining degree of nonlocality in the system, which would require a poten- tial with a cutoﬀof > 6 ˚A. However, this value must be chosen as a compromise: too large cutoﬀs will drastically increase the amount of required DFT reference data and DFT force deviation (eV Å−1) Li–C distance (Å) 10−1 10−2 10−3 10−4 10−5 102 101 2b cutoff MB cutoff Host structure without guest atom Host structure with guest atom (b) (a) Median (all data) Mean (all data) 100 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 Graphite Graphene Amorphous Compute DFT forces on given atom both without and with guest present Plot against distance between atom and guest FIG. 3.

Hence, intercalation in graphitic structures shows slightly higher nonlocality; this is qualitatively consistent with previous ﬁndings for diﬀerent forms of elemental carbon.40 B. Numerical errors The most straightforward test for the quality of the GAP (or any ML potential) is computing energies and forces for the DFT database and comparing them point- by-point to the reference values. In the present work, we are studying an intercalation system, and since the host framework can be suﬃciently described by the initial pure-carbon potential (Sec. II.B), we will here focus on the numerical errors for Li intercalation energies. We will show throughout this paper that, even in the presence of a notable residual numerical error, our potential can predict physical properties correctly. The resulting energy (per atom) and force scatterplots are presented in Fig. 4. Although the overall correla- tion appears to be satisfactory, the numerical errors for the Li intercalation energy are notable: the root-mean- square (mean absolute) energy errors are 0.37 (0.29) eV/at., respectively. We re-iterate that the DFT refer- ence database includes a large number of amorphous con- ﬁgurations on purpose, as well as small Li–C distances (below 1 ˚A in a few", "page": 6, "position": 0}

We re-iterate that the DFT refer- ence database includes a large number of amorphous con- ﬁgurations on purpose, as well as small Li–C distances (below 1 ˚A in a few cases; Fig. 3b). Indeed, for the amorphous subset of DFT data, the errors are highest (RMSE of 0.43 eV/at.), whereas for the graphite and graphene subsets they are lower (0.17 and 0.19 eV/at., respectively). For the present proof-of-concept study, it was our target to sample conﬁguration space as broadly as possible, and to show that this set of training data suf- ﬁces to recover the dynamics of Li atoms in graphitic-like frameworks. In future work, it may be interesting to ﬁt to larger databases sampled from GAP-driven MD tra- jectories, and thus to sample a more constrained region of conﬁguration space, in turn achieving higher numerical accuracy. Importantly, despite the notable residual energy error, the present version of the GAP performs very well in re- producing dynamical properties in MD trajectories, as will be shown in Sec. IV.C below. We believe that this is partly due to a satisfactory reconstruction of the inter- atomic forces. The root-mean-square and mean absolute errors are 0.25 and 0.12 eV ˚A−1 (Fig. 4b), respectively, and are signiﬁcantly better than those for our initial car- bon GAP (on the order of 1 eV ˚A−1; Ref. 40). This can be compared to a mean absolute error of 0.06 eV ˚A−1 for a state-of-the-art ML model tested on distorted crystal structures of Al,41 or to an RMSE of 0.46 eV ˚A−1 for a highly succcessful neural-network potential for amor- phous GeTe.32 Naturally, the more distorted and diverse the local atomic environments, the larger the overall er- ror will become.

We stress that even with a residual force error, the previous potential had aﬀorded very ac- curate predictions of structural, mechanical, and surface properties.40 Indeed, looking at numerical errors alone appears to be not enough when benchmarking eﬀective potentials for amorphous materials. As less comprehensive but more demonstrative tests, we next computed characteristic energy proﬁles for the most fundamental atomic-scale mechanisms in the Li– graphite system. We traced the energy proﬁles of an Li atom that is adsorbed on diﬀerent high-symmetry sites of a graphene sheet, and of an Li atom that diﬀuses through pristine graphite, performing DFT computations for ref- erence that are not included in the ﬁt. All three high- symmetry adsorption sites are correctly captured by the GAP (Fig. 5a), including the clear preference for the hol- low site, and the behavior both at short and long dis- tances is correctly reproduced. The two diﬀusion path- ways in graphite are also qualitatively correctly described (Fig. 5b), albeit a deviation from the DFT data is visi- ble; as the overall energy diﬀerences involved are smaller, the relative error is slightly more pronounced. Still, this result is satisfactory as the GAP has to reconstruct the pathway based on the training data, which do not in- clude the precise pathway itself. It is also noted that our numerical tests are highly simpliﬁed, by assuming a perfectly ordered graphite structure; in contrast, experi- mentally determined diﬀusion activation energies of Li in diﬀerent carbonaceous materials span a wide range (see, e.g., Ref. 73).", "page": 6, "position": 2}

C. Molecular-dynamics simulations The most important question, however—and one that is very diﬃcult to describe with DFT—, is the description of diﬀusion through molecular-dynamics (MD) simula- tions. Recall that for highly ordered systems, diﬀusivities have been extracted from NEB simulations of individual jumps,9,15 using the Arrhenius equation, but this is not easily possible in disordered and amorphous structures as there is a plethora of diﬀerent pathways to be consid- ered, each with their own associated barrier. A seminal study described DFT-driven MD simulations of Li inter- calation in carbon nanotubes, but also pointed out the limitations of the method.74 This underlines why new and ﬂexible interatomic potentials are needed for such applications. To directly assess the performance of our GAP, we per- formed MD simulations of an ensemble of four Li atoms in a disordered graphite-like structure (Fig. 6a); the lat- ter consists of predominantly sp2-bonded sheets, remi- niscent of graphite but with several defects (ﬁve- and seven-membered rings, as well as a covalently bonded link between two sheets).75 This provides us with a suit- able test system which allows us to probe the interaction of Li atoms with a diverse range of environments; the simulation cell is small enough to be amenable to DFT computations, and so we can generate benchmark results for properties of interest. While we have only been able to obtain a single DFT-MD trajectory, we performed several parallel GAP-MD runs due to the much lower computa- tional cost; each of these started from the same structure but with diﬀerent initial velocities.

While we have only been able to obtain a single DFT-MD trajectory, we performed several parallel GAP-MD runs due to the much lower computa- tional cost; each of these started from the same structure but with diﬀerent initial velocities. To probe the interaction of Li atoms both with the carbon framework and with one another, we inspect the radial distribution function (RDF) and angular distribu- tion function (ADF) curves (Fig. 6b–d). The agreement for both is highly satisfactory, especially given a certain inherent scatter in the GAP data (which is not a conse- quence of the method but of the system size) and the fact that our model has only been trained on small idealized graphite and graphene conﬁgurations as well as on fully amorphous structures. The Li–C RDF (Fig. 6b) is the most direct structural “ﬁngerprint” of Li intercalation: it shows a maximum at around 2.3 ˚A both in DFT- and GAP-driven MD. Small diﬀerences remain, in that the GAP-derived peak is slightly less pronounced; this is concomitant with a lowering of the average coordination number, obtained by integrating over the ﬁrst RDF peak up to 2.6 ˚A, from 7.3 (DFT) to 6.9 (GAP). The Li–Li RDF (Fig. 6c), like- wise, is an important quality criterion: it is where we ob- served the need for including an eﬀective Li–Li potential in the ﬁnal GAP model (Sec. II D), and the latter cor- rectly reproduces the very low likelihood of ﬁnding two Li atoms within 4 ˚A of one another. By contrast, the er- roneous behavior already discussed above is clearly seen at the hand of one exemplary GAP-MD trajectory driven by a model without this eﬀective potential (dashed, light blue line). In addition to these RDF analyses, the ADF in Fig. 6d is a more complex structural indicator, and is also very satisfactorily reproduced by GAP-MD. We assume that the remaining small diﬀerences, in part, may be due to likewise small diﬀerences in the un- derlying", "page": 7, "position": 1}

We assume that the remaining small diﬀerences, in part, may be due to likewise small diﬀerences in the un- derlying DFT methods: diﬀerent implementations and pseudopotentials are used for generating the GAP refer- ence data and the DFT-MD trajectory. Still, the GAP reproduces all general structural features. As a ﬁnal means of validation, we extract from the tra- jectories the vibrational densities of states (VDOS), us- ing the velocity–velocity autocorrelation function. This provides information about the atomic motion in the sim- ulations and a link between local structure and diﬀusion dynamics. We inspect the VDOS individually, both for the host framework and the Li atoms, in Fig. 7. There is good agreement between DFT and GAP data, and the general features of the VDOS are well reproduced by our model. This is particularly so in the higher-frequency range (> 15 THz), which relates mostly to interatomic in- teractions (such as bond-stretching vibrations). At lower frequencies, we observe small discrepancies, while the general trends are preserved. This frequency range is commonly associated with the diﬀusion process, and so the above can be understood considering the short run- time of the calculation and especially the small size of the systems (again, both are due to the inherent compu- tational and scaling limitations of the DFT benchmark, and do not change the principal validity of our tests).", "page": 7, "position": 2}

CONCLUSIONS Machine-learning-based interatomic potentials for guest atoms in host structures can be created by ﬁtting to the energy and force diﬀerences which they induce. We exempliﬁed this for Li intercalation in graphitic and dis- ordered carbon structures, using the GAP framework to construct an interatomic potential model.
