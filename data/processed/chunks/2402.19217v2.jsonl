The electron coherent states and a quantum field version of photon density waves will be the joining theories that will explain the electron-photon interaction within the lithium- silicon lattice structure. These two quantum particles will be responsible for the photon absorption rate of silicon atoms that are hypothesized to be the leading cause of breaking diatomic silicon covalent bonds that ultimately leads to volume expansion. It will be demonstrated through the combination of Maxwell stress tensor, optical amplification and path integrals that a stochastic analyze using a variety of Poisson distributions that the anisotropic expansion rates in the <110>, <111> and <112> orthogonal directions confirms the findings ascertained in previous works made by other research groups. The computational findings presented in this work are similar to those which were discovered experimentally using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and simulation models that used density functional theory (DFT) and molecular dynamics (MD). The refractive index and electric susceptibility parameters of lithiated silicon are interwoven in the first principle theoretical equations and appears frequently throughout this research presentation, which should serve to demonstrate the importance of these parameters in the understanding of this component in lithium ion batteries.

Introduction The research work that will be presented is a continuation from a study that examined how energy was transformed within an electron flux that transverse a cubic silicon crystal lattice in the opposing direction of lithium ion diffusion [1]. The previous study was a computational model to examine how a surplus of electron charge could lead to an exponential increase in applied electromagnetic energy that could possibly result in enough energy to sever the covalent bonds between silicon atoms that was hypothesis to be the genesis of the anisotropic volume expansion witness during lithium ion insertion. This work used an interdisciplinary approach within physics with quantum mechanics serving as the main mathematical framework. The preceding study, which is the edifice of this current work, uses first principle theories that are accepted throughout physics. This methodology will continue in this paper. It is the goal at the end of this research study that we will come closer to the elusive explanation of the electrochemical kinetics of lithiated silicon nanowires. The research body of knowledge for lithiated silicon anode materials has been exclusively focused on lithium ion diffusion process. The research work by Liu et al. anisotropic volume expansion of lithiated silicon nanowires was studied employing transmission electron microscope (TEM) and electron diffraction pattern (EDP) [2].

In addition, a crack along the longitudinal direction of <112> was detected. A similar results were performed by Yang et al. by utilizing a chemomechanical finite element model to simulate several crystallography orientation-dependent anisotropic volume expansions of over 300%, with increases initiating at the interfacial reaction fronts of lithiated silicon nanowire models [3]. The research study performed by Cubuk et al. used the kinetic Monte Carlo (kMC) method to simulate the lithium atoms insertion into silicon nanowire. The expansion rates were calculated seven times faster in the <110> direction than the <111> direction [4]. This gave the expanded lithiated silicon nanowire a described “dumbbell cross section” shape that resembled the Cassini oval curve geometry. The work drawn from Jung et al. molecular dynamics/density functional theory (MD/DFT) simulation was created to study the atomistic behavior of the two-phase interfacial reaction front barrier that separates the c-Si and LixSi material [5]. All of these works support the findings that the volume of silicon nanowires during lithium atom/ion insertion will increase non-isotopically by nature. For the purpose of continuity, our theoretical apparatus will be briefly re-examined as it was presented in our previous work. Prior to the beginning of the lithiation process, the individual lithium atoms are ionized reducing them to the constitutive particles of lithium ions and free electrons [6]. A constant voltage of 2 V is applied to an electric series circuit in order for the lithiation process to begin. The electrons and lithium ions will enter the silicon nanowire at opposing ends and therefore travel in opposite directions (Figure 1). When the lithiation begins, this initiates a process of transforming the silicon from c-Si to an amorphous lithiated silicon (a-LiSi) matrix [7,8].

Since the electrons are moving charge particles, they are the source of the applied quantized electromagnetic field.

Poisson Distribution of the Negative Charge Differential (nc) As mentioned previously, negative free electrons and positive lithium ions enter into our computational model from opposing directions. The electric charge difference between the two constitutive mass particles, where the electrons are always greater or equal in number to the lithium ions in our model, will be known as the negative charge differential nc which exist within the conduction band of the quantum harmonic oscillator. The state of the negative charge distribution within the conduction band is defined by a Poisson distribution called the negative charge differential probability Npq.

The 𝑛̅𝑐 parameter will be the main independent variable in this research work. The negative charge differential 𝑛𝑐 will be thought of as varying at each moment in time. Any particular average 𝑛̅𝑐 will be defined by the Poisson curve from 0 ≤𝑛𝑐≤ ∞ with the peak value of any curve being the mean value 𝑛̅𝑐. Each 𝑛𝑐 is assigned a probability between 0 to 1.

Maxwell Stress For this research work, there will be a special notion that will be used throughout this study to indicate the orthogonal directions that are essential element in the presentation of this paper. As an example, the mathematical variables and functions that have directional characteristics will have subscripted notations that will indicate which orthogonal direction is being represented: 𝐴𝑖𝑗= 𝐴〈𝑂𝑟𝑡ℎ𝑜𝑔𝑜𝑛𝑎𝑙 𝑑𝑖𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛〉 i=j=1 or 2 or 3; 𝐴11 = 𝐴〈110〉 𝐴22 = 𝐴〈111〉 𝐴33 = 𝐴〈112〉 The negative charge differential 𝑛𝑐 resides within the conduction bands of the lithiated silicon lattice. In order to construct the minimum conduction band, a Bloch function based on electron scattering theory is used uc(r) = eikr + 1 kr ei(δ+kr) sin δ + 3z kr2 ei(δ+kr) sin 𝛿 (2) with position vectors r and z as variables [12]. The wavenumber k is the expectation value of <k> based on the silicon atoms’ ground state wave function within the c-Si lattice prior to the beginning of lithiation. The silicon ground state wave function was calculated using Slater determinant of the four core silicon atoms in c-Si lattice as shown in Figure 2. The phase shift δ(k, r) is define as function of both <k> and position vector r. The Bloch function consist of three terms, the first term is known as the incident wave function and the second and third term collectively is called the scattering wave function. When an electron is traveling in the conduction band, the first term of the wave function describes the electron from a point before impact with the oncoming atom (incident wave function) and the second and third term of the wave function describes the electron after the impact with the colliding atom (scattering wave function).

Optical Amplification The applied electromagnetic field that is composed of photons, splits the energy levels within the lithium ions due to the applied electric field (Stark Effect) and by the applied magnetic field (Zeeman Effect). When photons are absorbed by a lithium ion, the ion experiences an excitation that transitions the lithium ion from the ground state to excited state. The electrons in the excited lithium ion transition to a higher discrete energy level. Once the lithium ion transitions to an elevated energy level, it is subjected to the spontaneous emission process as displayed in Figure 3. Figure 3. Spontaneous Emission.

Lithium ions during the diffusion process increase the density ratio of lithium to silicon atoms define by x in LixSi [19]. The increase in x signifies that the lithium ions are increasing in number within the silicon lattice [20]. With the continuation of photons absorbing into the diffused lithium ions causing excitation and at the same time the diffusion process causes an increase in lithiated silicon density, the total atomic system in our lithiated silicon lattice model experiences population inversion which is define as a majority of atoms or ions being in the excited state. When the lithium ions are in such a state with photons being transmitted and absorbed within this dense lithium-silicon particle matrix, populated inversion is the prelude to the stimulated emission process (Figure 4).

The electric field is of the order of 10−15 and the magnetic field is 10−22. The energy that is stored in the applied electromagnetic field is of the magnitude of 10−44 eV. However, when electrons cross the interfacial reaction front that separates c-Si and LixSi the EM field increases by the order of 1025 due to the metallic properties of lithium. When electrons and lithium ions make contact and 𝑛𝑐 is non zero, the EM field diverges into the three orthogonal components of <110>, <111> and <112> as mentioned earlier in this study (Figure 5a,b). The three electric fields are of the order of 109. However, the magnetic field is of the order of 100 and thus its contributions to the EM field are negligible. When 𝑛̅c = 6 in the <110> direction, there is a great surge in the applied EM energy of the magnitude of 30.7 eV due to the Maxwell stress tensor. When the applied EM field stores this much energy, the individual photons that comprise the quantized electromagnetic field are energetic enough to break covalent bonds between silicon atoms [23]. Similarly, in the other orthogonal directions of <111> and <112>, there are surges of approximately 30 eV of EM energy, however at 𝑛̅c = 13 and 19 respectively. The surges in energy in the EM field are caused by optical amplification, which is due to stimulated emission.

The second term is the thermal energy that the electron experiences while in the QHO where 𝑘𝑏 and T are the Boltzmann constant and temperature, respectively. Each of the two energy bands are represented by a different angular momentum equation, as shown in Equations (22) and (23), and are composed of sub-energy levels or energy states that are a function of the negative charge differential 𝑛𝑐. It was found necessary to utilize two different angular momentums for 𝐸𝑛 in order to maintain the energy gap between the minimum and upper conduction bands and to prevent the energy states of 𝐸0 and 𝐸1 from over lapping. The QHO is nonlinear due to the angular momentum is not constant and is dependent of the negative charge differential 𝑛𝑐 [26,27].

All other energy states are above c and therefore are disregarded. The nonlinear QHO can be thought of as three interwoven quantum harmonic oscillators; one for each of the orthogonal directions. When all three directional nonlinear QHOs are analyzed separately, the individual energy states are shown to be not equally spaced (Figure 7b). Analyzing the E1 conduction band structure by separating the individual QHOs, one can see that most of the lowest energy states reside in the <110> direction. When a particular electron obtains enough energy due to photon absorption during optical amplification of the EM field, the electron transition from the minimum conduction band 𝐸0 to an available energy state in 𝐸1 (Figure 7c). It is the hypothesis of this research work that due to the strain that is created during the anisotropic volume expansion primarily in the <110> direction—due to optical amplification of the electromagnetic field—that the electrons in the sub-energy levels in 𝐸0 will generally transition to the lowest and most stable energy states in the <110> direction in the 𝐸1 conduction band since it has lowest sub-energy levels than the <111> and <112> energy state directions [28–30].

It is this movement of electrons within 𝐸0 that creates the low applied electromagnetic field that was displayed in Figure 5b. The reason individual electrons transition from one energy state to another are the multiple electron–photon interactions within 𝐸0. The lowest energy state in the minimum conduction band 𝐸0 is 0.14 eV, which can be interpreted as the direct band gap energy between the maximum valence band and the minimum conduction band in lithiated silicon, which is in sharp contrast to crystalline silicon with an indirect band gap energy of 1.1 eV [31]. The nonlinear quantum harmonic oscillator within this computational model has similar features to the quantum confined Stark effect (QCSE) [32,33].

This results in the time-dependent Bloch function ucij(r, t) of being a function of the average negative charge differential 𝑛̅𝑐. The location of the probability amplitudes Uij for each of the coherent states for the three orthogonal directions of <110>, <111> and <112> corresponds to the maximum EM field energy as displayed in Figure 5a.

Figure 10. The transition probability 𝑃𝑖𝑗 for each of the orthogonal directions suggest that the expansion rate and volume increase is resembling to be isotropic rather than anisotropic as reported in several research studies.

Prior to the electrons crossing the interfacial reaction front and encountering lithium ions, the positive Li ions are the only charge particles within the lithiated silicon lattice structure (Figure 11a). These positive-charge particles are under a Coulombic repulsive potential that intends to push them farther apart from one another. When the electron flux encounters these Li ions, the negative electrons interact with the positive Li ions, in which an attractive potential manifests that creates the quasi- particles called polarons [9]. Each individual polaron will be assigned the variable 𝑛𝑐 , for which this value changes with respect to both space and time. The polaron are define by a wave function Ψ𝑝 𝑒 and a transition state vector 𝑟 𝑖𝑗 which is define as the difference between initial and final state vectors 𝑟 𝑖𝑗= 𝑟 1𝑖𝑗−𝑟 0𝑖𝑗 (Figure 11b). Figure 11.

As a polaron transitions from an initial state arrive at a final state (Figure 11), the transition probability 𝑃𝑖𝑗 at the end of the transition state vector 𝑟 𝑖𝑗 is the parameter that determines whether an electron from the polaron will emit a photon 𝔼𝑖𝑗 that will be absorb by a silicon atom with energy greater than the cohesive energy 𝔼𝑐𝑜ℎ of two silicon atoms. In general, the shorter the transition state vectors 𝑟 𝑖𝑗 in one of the orthogonal directions, the greater the number of transition probability 𝑃𝑖𝑗 events per unit length in that direction. The transition probability 𝑃𝑖𝑗 for each of the three orthogonal directions is very low in magnitude as shown previously in Figure 10. Therefore, at each final state vector there is a low probability that there will be a photon absorption event of 𝔼𝑖𝑗≥𝔼𝑐𝑜ℎ. When there is an equal number of Li ions and electrons (𝑛𝑐 = 0) in a cubic lattice structure, the length of the transition state vector 𝑟 𝑖𝑗 is the same in all three orthogonal directions.

The orthogonal expansion rate ratio in the ∆𝑟 ⟨110⟩/∆𝑟 ⟨111⟩ directions corresponds to that which was reported by previous research studies both experimentally with the transmission electron microscopy and with density functional theory /molecular dynamics simulations. 10. Volume Increase and Geometric Cross-Sectional Area Configuration The volume expansion and geometric configuration of the silicon nanowire at full lithiation can best be demonstrated by deriving a set of equations from the Cassini oval geometry [40]. In this study, the computational model simulated the nanowire volume increase of 300% upon the conclusion of lithium ion insertion. There is a volume change ∆𝑉𝑖𝑗 in each of the three orthogonal directions of <110>, <111> and <112> , with each volume component a function of ∆𝑟 𝑖𝑗 ∆𝑉11 = 𝑉𝑚𝑎𝑥 ∆𝑟 11 2 ∆𝑟 𝑚𝑎𝑥 2 ∆𝑉22 = 𝑉𝑚𝑎𝑥 ∆𝑟 22 2 ∆𝑟 𝑚𝑎𝑥 2 ∆𝑉33 = ∆𝑟 33 ∆𝑟 𝑚𝑎𝑥 √( 2 𝜋𝑉𝑚𝑎𝑥) (46) with 𝑉𝑚𝑎𝑥 being the total maximum volume increase and is define as 𝑉𝑚𝑎𝑥= ∆𝑉11 + ∆𝑉22 + ∆𝑉33 (Figure 15a). The maximum decrease in the transition state vector ∆𝑟 𝑚𝑎𝑥 is defined as ∆𝑟 11 at 𝑛̅𝑐 = 6 in the <110> direction as displayed in Figure 12. = 11.88 = 64.57 = 25.20 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 Expansion Rate Ratios Average Negative Charge Differential Anisotropic Expansion Rates ∆ 𝑟110 /∆ 𝑟112 ∆ 𝑟110 /∆ 𝑟111 ̅𝑛𝑐 at ̅𝑛𝑐=6 ∆ 𝑟111 /∆ 𝑟112 at ̅𝑛𝑐=6 at ̅𝑛𝑐=11 ∆ 𝑟𝑖𝑗/∆ 𝑟𝑖𝑗", "page": 18, "position": 0}

The majority of the volume increase was in the <110> direction with only a small volumetric increase in the <111> and <112> directions; (b) The largest radius increase was in the <110> direction due to the overwhelming volume expansion in this direction compared to the <111> and <112> orthogonal directions.

The radius value of 𝑑𝑖𝑗= 1 in all three orthogonal directions defines the initial volume of the silicon nanowire prior to anisotropic expansion. The lithiated silicon nanowire is at its largest volume expansion when the average negative charge differential is 𝑛̅𝑐 = 6. This corresponds to the time when the radius 𝑑〈110〉 is at its greatest value 𝑑11 = 2.31 and the radius 𝑑〈111〉 is at 𝑑22 = 1.10, which together these two radii form the Cassini oval cross-section geometry (Figure 16). This specific shape has been witnessed in TEM before. However, this work predicts that at 𝑛̅𝑐 = 13 the radius in the <111> direction is slightly larger (𝑑22 = 1.29) than in the <110> direction (𝑑11 = 1.10). At even higher 𝑛̅𝑐 values (𝑛̅𝑐 >18), there is a negligible increase in volume in the cross sectional area of the silicon nanowire with a very small increase in volume in longitudinal direction of <112> with an increase in length of 𝐿33 = 1.15 at 𝑛̅𝑐= 18. Figure 16. The cross-sectional configuration at varies 𝑛̅𝑐 values. As the average negative charge differential increases, the anisotropic Cassini oval area reaches its peak at 𝑛̅𝑐 = 6. At this point with increasing 𝑛̅𝑐 the cross-sectional areas are beginning to resemble areas from lower 𝑛̅𝑐. It is important to note that the lithiated silicon nanowire is not elastic however plastic in nature. Therefore, once the nanowire has expanded to a certain volume, it does not contract to a previous smaller volume [2,3,44]. 11.

Appl. 2017, 22, 41 22 of 24 ultimately defines the energy within our model as the moving charges induce an applied EM field. The energy of this EM field is defined by the Maxwell stress tensor. With the application of energy from the applied electromagnetic field, several processes begin. First, the applied EM field begins the process of spontaneous and stimulated emission that will lead to the optical amplification of the electromagnetic field. This will ultimately lead to a coherent state for the electrons once amplification occurs. With the increase of the electromagnetic field, energetic photons within the field interact with constitutive particles that are present within the matrix of our model. These photons will be absorbed by electrons, lithium ions and silicon atoms. The optical amplification of photons will be absorbed by electrons in the minimum conduction band and transition to the upper conduction band. In an iterative process, amplified photons that are absorbed by lithium ions—which were induced by optical amplification initially—will continue to be the driving energy throughout the lithiated silicon nanowire. In addition, amplified photons with energy greater than the cohesion energy of silicon atoms will also be absorbed by these particles that will possibly break the cohesion bond between two silicon atoms that will initiate the start of silicon nanowire expansion. It was also demonstrated in this research that true to the nature of quantum physics, physical processes are governed by probabilistic events. A series of calculated events culminated into the transition probability 𝑃𝑖𝑗 , that stochastically determines the silicon atom photon absorption rate. However, that alone would not produce the anisotropic expansion that is witnessed in TEM images. The optical amplification of the EM field was discovered to be greater in the <110> orthogonal direction than in the <111> and <112> direction due to the refractive indices 𝑛𝑖𝑗 or electric susceptibilities 𝜀𝑖𝑗 of the lithium-silicon material. The 𝑛𝑖𝑗 or 𝜀𝑖𝑗 were present in the Maxwell stress, the optical amplification, the nonlinear quantum harmonic oscillator, the electron coherent state, the photon density waves and the path integral method equations.

The refractive indices were found to be inversely proportional to the electric field and thus as the electric susceptibilities decrease in magnitude the electric field increases in strength especially in the <110> direction. The path integral method was the mathematical theory to show that a dramatic increase in the Maxwell stress or energy density in the <110> orthogonal direction will result in a greater expansion in this direction than in the <111> and <112> orthogonal directions.
