While the importance of moving beyond Butler-Volmer kinetics and incorporating the effect of electronic density of states of the electrode have been recognized, a uniﬁed framework that incorporates these aspects directly into elec- trochemical performance models is still lacking. In this work, we explicitly account for the DFT-calculated density of states numerically in calculating electrochemical reaction rates for a variety of electrode-electrolyte interfaces. We ﬁrst show the utility of this for two cases related to Li metal electrodeposition and stripping on a Li surface and a Cu surface (anode-free conﬁguration). The deviation in reaction rates is minor for cases with ﬂat densities of states such as Li, but is signiﬁcant for Cu due to nondispersive d-bands creating large variation. Finally, we consider a semiconducting case of a solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) consisting of LiF and Li2CO3 and note the importance of the Fermi level at the interface, pinned by the redox reaction occuring there. We identify the asymmetry in reaction rates as a function of discharge/charge naturally within this approach. The analysis code used in this work is available open-source on Github. I. INTRODUCTION Reactions at electrode-electrolyte interfaces control the limits of operation of various electrochemical devices. In the case of batteries, interfacial kinetics control the rate of re- actions at the anode and cathode, which ultimately lead to limits on fast discharge and charge capability of modern Li- ion batteries.1,2 Fast charging is an important requirement for electric vehicles,3 while fast discharge is necessary for elec- tric vertical take-off and landing aircraft.4 In particular, there is signiﬁcant interest in modifying the reaction rates of elec- trodeposition and stripping of Li metal electrodes by modi- fying the nature of the so-called solid electrolyte interphase (SEI).5 The typical kinetic rate law used for Li metal electrodes is Butler-Volmer.6 Recently,", "page": 0, "position": 0}

In an accompanying paper for this Special Issue, we ex- tend that analysis and show the importance of accounting for the full MHC kinetic rate behavior.10 However, most treat- ments assume that the electrode density of states (DOS) is constant and independent of the energy states/overpotential. In this work, we incorporate the effect of the DOS at the electrode using density functional theory calculations directly and numerically show its importance for a variety of cases. We begin by discussing the effect of the DOS for Li electrode- position and stripping for Li metal electrodes. Given the rela- tively ﬂat nature of the DOS of Li metal, it affects the kinetic rates to a lesser extent. Next, we discuss the case of metal electrodeposition on Cu. Given the DOS associated with the more localized d-band states, there is signiﬁcant deviation be- tween the kinetic behavior when accounting for its variation compared to assuming a constant DOS. This highlights that the electronic states of the metal are an important factor in determining high-rate performance on anode-free cells.11 Fi- nally, we discuss the case of an electrochemical redox reaction with the density of states determined by example SEI compo- nents, LiF and Li2CO3.

II. METHODS A. Theoretical Approach The insight of Chidsey9, namely, that it is critical to con- sider the occupation of electronic states when assessing rate constants within a Marcus-type theory, was important. Build- ing on this insight, the rate expressions developed in MHC theory (we here adapt notation from Reference 12) are: kred ∝ Z ∞ −∞|V(ε)|2 exp \u0012 −(λ −eη +ε)2 4λkBT \u0013 fFD(ε)dε , (1) kox ∝ Z ∞ −∞|V(ε)|2 exp \u0012 −(λ +eη −ε)2 4λkBT \u0013\u00001−fFD(ε) \u0001 dε , (2) for the reductive and oxidative directions, respectively, where V(ε) denotes a coupling constant between the (presumed lo- calized) states on the electrolyte molecule and the (presumed plane-wave-like) states in the solid electrode. This coupling constant includes the density of states as well as an overlap integral term. λ is the reorganization energy, e the electronic charge, η the applied overpotential, kB Boltzmann’s constant, and T the absolute temperature. All energies ε are measured relative to the Fermi level Ef and fFD denotes the Fermi-Dirac distribution for occupation of states by electrons: arXiv:2007.15756v1 [physics.chem-ph] 30 Jul 2020", "page": 0, "position": 2}

In prior analyses, either explicitly or implicitly, the |V(ε)|2 term is presumed to have weak energy dependence and brought outside the integral. This allows the simpliﬁcation presented in Reference 13, taking advantage of the fact that the integral is over the whole real line and the Fermi-Dirac dis- tributions for electrons and holes can be equivalently thought of as complements of each other, or equal but with the energy coordinate running in the opposite direction: kox/red ∝ Z ∞ −∞exp \u0012 −(ε −λ ±eη)2 4λkBT \u0013 dε 1+exp \u0010 ε kBT \u0011 . (4) However, this treatment neglects the electrode’s DOS, which generally does have strong variations with energy, especially over scales larger than a few kBT. The most extreme example of this is in a semiconductor, where the value is identically zero at and near the Fermi level. This, as we will show, can lead to dramatically different rate constant predictions. How- ever, even in the case of a transition metal (which often has large spikes in the DOS due to highly localized d-bands), this assumption can break down. In our analysis, we consider adapted versions of Equa- tions 1 and 2 where we explicitly account for the electrode DOS D(ε): kred ∝ Z D(ε)exp \u0012 −(λ −eη +ε)2 4λkBT \u0013 exp \u0010 ε kBT \u0011 1+exp \u0010 ε kBT \u0011dε , (5) kox ∝ Z D(ε)exp \u0012 −(λ +eη −ε)2 4λkBT \u0013 dε 1+exp \u0010 ε kBT \u0011 , (6) Because DOSes are not deﬁned over an inﬁnite range of en- ergies, we must truncate the integrals in our calculations. In practice, this makes no discernible difference to the predicted rate constants, because the Gaussian terms fall off dramati- cally within a relatively small energy range from Ef. We note also that the dependence of the density of states (and to a lesser extent, the coupling constant that is also part of the |V(ε)|2 term in Equations 1 and 2) has been described be- fore14, but is generally either assumed to", "page": 1, "position": 0}

To our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst analysis that explicitly accounts for the DFT-calculated DOS numerically in directly calculat- ing rates for electrochemical reactions at electrode-electrolyte interfaces. B. Computational Approach In this work, we use the Julia programming language to calculate the integrals described above using adaptive Gauss- Kronrod quadrature15 as implemented in the QuadGK.jl pack- age. Density functional theory calculations for Li and Cu were conducted using the GPAW package16 through the Atomic Simulation Environment package.17 Ion-electron in- teractions were treated using the Projector Augmented Wave approach.18 For all calculations, a grid spacing of 0.16 Å and a 4 × 4 × 1 Monkhorst-Pack k-mesh were used.19 To improve self-consistent ﬁeld convergence, Fermi smearing was applied to electron occupation with a width of 0.05 eV. All relaxations and analysis, unless otherwise speciﬁed, were conducted us- ing the BEEF-vdW exchange-correlation functional. DOSes were calculated with a 100 meV Gaussian smearing width. Calculations for LiF/Li2CO3 were performed in Quantum Espresso according to methods described in Reference 20. III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION A. Li metal anode The ﬁrst case is the redox processes occuring in a Li metal electrode. The overal redox reaction is given by Li+ +e−⇌Li, (7) where the forward reaction denotes electrodeposition (charg- ing) and backward reaction denotes stripping (discharging). The reaction rates are dependent on the organic electrolyte used7 and the analysis is presented for the case of an EC:DEC electrolyte.

Figure 1 shows experimental data and best-ﬁt re- sults for each model (Results modeled with Equation 4 are indicated in ﬁgure legends by “MHC” and from Equations 5 and 6 by “MHC+DOS”). Note that over the experimental overpotential range of ±0.2V the two models ﬁt equally well. This is due to the fact that the DOS is relatively ﬂat over this range. Over the full range of the plot, one can start to see variation between the models, but only modestly. This case illustrates why the importance of this more gen- eralized analysis could have been missed previously – at rela- tively modest overpotentials, many DOSes are “close enough” to ﬂat that predictions of the traditional MHC model and the one we present here differ little. We will now turn to cases where the two models show larger discrepancies. B. Cu current collector We next examine the case of depositing Li in an anode-free conﬁguration on top of a Cu current collector.11 This is given by the equation Li+ +e−⇌Li∗, (8)", "page": 1, "position": 2}

The DOS (a) and predicted rate constants (b) for the Cu(111) surface are shown in Figure 2. We chose Cu(111) as it has the most desirable nucleation characteristics among the low Miller in- dex surfaces,11 in addition to the lowest surface energy.21 Note that due to the high density of states in the Cu d-bands start- ing approximately 1.5 eV below the equilibrium Ef, a jump of roughly an order of magnitude in the rate constant is ob- served at this overpotential. An overpotential of this mag- nitude is entirely feasible, particularly in the context of the fast charge/discharge rates currently targeted for many appli- cations. It is worth noting that the scale of variation in DOS (i.e. an order of magnitude) is approximately equal to the change in predicted rate constant. Indeed, one should expect this pro- vided λ is much smaller than the overpotential window of interest, since λ essentially parametrizes a sliding Gaussian ﬁlter through which the DOS impacts k via the denominator of the ﬁrst exponential terms in Equations 5 and 6.

Eﬀect of Solid-Electrolyte-Interphase (SEI) We will now consider the case where the Li electrode is covered with an inorganic solid electrolyte interphase due to spontaneous reaction with the organic electrolyte typically used in Li-metal batteries. While the exact nature of the SEI remains an active area of research, it is widely acknowledged that some of the inorganic phases present include Li2CO3, LiF, Li2O, etc.22 We consider a model SEI consisting of an in- terface between LiF and", "page": 2, "position": 0}

Most SEI components are semiconducting or insulating by design and hence, the kinet- ics for this semiconductor-electrolyte interface are quite dif- ferent. Figure 3 shows the results of this modeling. Because the DOS is identically zero throughout the ∼4 eV bandgap, and the equilibrium Ef position of the pristine interface is at midgap, there is a discrepancy of as much as 8 orders of mag- nitude between the predictions of the two models, even at low overpotentials, indicating the criticality of considering the en- ergy dependency of the DOS in this context. This further sub- stantiates the remark above regarding the scale of variation of the DOS – because it goes to zero (over a window of many λ) in the bandgap, this scale tends to inﬁnity, and the scale of the discrepancy in k likewise diverges.", "page": 2, "position": 1}

D. Eﬀects of model parameters Several parameters in the form of energy scales control the behavior of these models. Some of their behavior has already been alluded to above, and we examine these effects more closely here. First is the position of the equilibrium Fermi level Ef. Thus far, we have assumed it to be at the position pre- dicted by DFT for a pristine surface. However, many system variables can inﬂuence this energy. Bulk or surface defects can shift Ef. In an electrochemical system, the redox reaction sets the Fermi level at the electrode-electrolyte interface and is an independent variable.24 Figure 4a shows the effect of shifting Ef on the SEI case. In particular, we presume an alternative redox couple (or equiva- lently, a particular voltage on the Li/Li+ scale) is chosen such that the equilibrium Ef is near the valence band maximum of the SEI. In this case, the behavior at low overpotentials ex- hibits a marked asymmetry: at negative η (pushing further into the valence bands), k rises sharply, while at positive η (pushing back into the bandgap), it drops exponentially until reaching midgap, whereupon it rises again as the conduction band minimum begins to have an impact. Such an asymmetry depending on the redox potential has been recognized25 and observed26 in Li-O2 batteries where discharge product, Li2O2, FIG. 4. a) Rate constant for SEI with equilibrium (midgap) Ef (re- produced from Figure 3 for reference), and with E f shifted 2 eV down, to near the valence band maximum. b) Rate constant for Cu (111) from Figure 2 compared to the same calculation but with the reorganization energy λ doubled. is a wide-band gap insulator similar to the LiF/Li2CO3 inter- face considered here.

Figure 4b shows the effect of varying the reorganization en- ergy λ. As mentioned previously, the mathematical effect of λ is primarily to act as a Gaussian smoothing ﬁlter on the density of states. However, an increased λ also increases the offset between the ﬁlters in the positive and negative direc- tion, with the overall result being a slower varying and slightly outward-shifted k vs. η curve. To better build intuition for the impact of these pa- rameters, we have built an interactive visualization which can be viewed at https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/ github/aced-differentiate/MHC_DOS/blob/master/ dataviz.ipynb. It features the DOSes for all materials considered in this work, and allows the viewer to modify Ef, λ, and the temperature, and see in real time how rate constant predictions change. IV.

We discuss three cases, electrodeposition on (i) Li surface and (ii) Cu surface, and (iii) redox reactions at an SEI component chosen here to be LiF/Li2CO3 interface. For the case of the Li surface, due to a relatively ﬂat density of states, we ﬁnd minor deviations from the standard MHC rate law. In the case of a Cu surface, mimicking an anode-free Li metal battery, the d-bands of Cu can signiﬁcantly modify the rate constants, especially at high rates of charge and discharge. Finally, we show the drastic changes in reaction rates for a semiconducting interface and note the importance of the location of the Fermi level, which is pinned by the redox reactions occurring at that interface. We show strong asymmetric behavior for the SEI case, similar to that noted for Li2O2 in Li-O2 batteries. We have also made all analysis code available open-source so that the community can take advantage of these models. V.
