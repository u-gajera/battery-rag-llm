Possible decomposition pathways via H-abstraction and EC ring-opening reaction that leads to the generation of CO2 and C2H4 gases are studied from the thermodynamic and kinetic aspects. Firstly, we find that molecular EC preferably adsorbs on both pristine and defective ZnO (1010) via the bonding between its carbonyl oxygen (OC) and surface Zn. Secondly, subsequent decomposition reactions show large tendency of EC to decompose on both pristine and defective ZnO (1010). This tendency is indicated by the large thermodynamic driving forces to decompose EC that range from -1.5 eV to -2.5 eV on both pristine and defective ZnO (1010) (calculated with respect to EC gas phase). The large tendency of EC to decompose, however, is hindered by the high activation barriers of the EC decomposition, shown by the lowest activation barrier of 0.96 eV on Zn vacancy defected ZnO (1010). Our results thus indicate that EC decomposition on ZnO (1010) is mainly hindered due to its slow rate of decomposition instead of the thermodynamic factors. KEYWORDS.

Introduction High energy cathode for Li-ion battery (LIB) such as Ni-rich NCM, NCA, and Li-rich layered oxides are in high demand for electric vehicle and grid energy storage applications. To ensure their energy capacity can be utilized up to near their theoretical values, it is required to go beyond the current typical commercially LIB operating limit, i.e., State of Charge (SOC) > 50% [1,2]. However, the required condition is hindered to attain mainly due to rapid loss of cathode energy capacity in particular when the LIB is cycled to high voltage, i.e., > ~ 4.4 VLi [3‚Äì5]. One of the main origins of the capacity loss of layered cathode is structural deterioration due to irreversible phase transformation from layered to disordered spinel/rock-salt. This phase transformation is commonly initiated from the cathode surface and subsequently propagates into", "page": 1, "position": 0}

Previous studies have observed that the phase transformation of the cathode is closely related to the electrochemical/chemical oxidation of the liquid electrolyte catalyzed by the cathode surface. For instance, by using On-Line Electrochemical Mass Spectroscopy (OEMS), Jung et al proposed a mechanism in which surface lattice oxygen of layered oxide cathodes (viz., NMC111, NMC622, NMC811 and LNMO) induces liquid carbonate decomposition into carbon- and oxygen-containing gases (e.g., CO, CO2, C2H4) [9]. The then released lattice oxygen creates a vacancy defect that may accelerate metal cation migration to the Li layer, eventually leads to the detrimental rock-salt phase formation on the cathode [7,10,11]. Further, the products of cathode-electrolyte interaction are found to also trigger rapid growth of the cathode-electrolyte interface (CEI) layer [12‚Äì14]. The uncontrolled side reaction of electrolyte decomposition on the CEI layer combined with irreversible phase transformation of the cathode can eventually degrade the overall electrochemical performance of the LIB. In addition, there is also safety concern with regard to the built-up pressure inside the LIB cell due to the residual gas produced by the electrolyte decomposition. Depositing a protective coating layer on the LIB cathode surface is a promising way to enhance the cathode stability at a high operating voltage. Various compounds such as metal oxides [15‚Äì 17], phosphates [18], and fluorides [19] have been reported as potential protective coating materials for LIB cathode. Several mechanisms have been proposed in order to explain the enhanced stability of the coated cathode: (1) the coating scavenges HF molecule, thus decreasing local acidity at the cathode-electrolyte interface area [20], (2) the coating shields the active cathode materials from deleterious (electro)chemical decomposition reactions of the electrolyte [21,22] and (3) the coating mitigates irreversible structural deformation on the cathode due to surface oxygen loss, transition metal dissolution and surface cation migration [23‚Äì25]. Based on the aforementioned proposed mechanisms, several studies have even attempted to systematically screen candidates of coating materials with robust thermodynamic stability against HF formation and LiF precipitation [26]. There were other studies", "page": 2, "position": 0}

This is mainly due to the challenging task on probing details of the reaction between the protective coating later with the carbonate molecule. While previous studies have shown that carbonate molecules (e.g., EC, DMC) can react with the cathode surface to produce gaseous compounds [29‚Äì31], the detailed reaction of the carbonates with the coating layer is not yet studied in detail. This study is important in order to assess the ability of the coating layer to also decrease the decomposition of carbonates. Understanding the thermodynamic and kinetic of carbonate molecule decomposition on the coating layer surface is important to obtain optimum design rules of the protective coating layer. In this work, we investigate ethylene carbonate (EC) decomposition on pristine and defective ZnO (1010) surfaces. ZnO is chosen as a model for the protective coating layer because previous studies have shown the increased electrochemical performance of LIB composed of ZnO-coated cathodes [31‚Äì33]. We start by evaluating all thermodynamically stable adsorption configurations on both pristine and defective ZnO (1010) surfaces. Two surface point defects are considered, i.e., the O and Zn vacancies (Ovac and Znvac). Our consideration to include point defects is based on previous reports that most protective coating layer is in the amorphous form [28,34,35]. Thus, the inclusion of point defect in our crystalline ZnO model is an attempt to include the under- coordinated local Zn-O bonds that commonly exist in an amorphous ZnO (as well as any other amorphous oxides). We then investigate several possible EC decomposition reactions that lead to the generation of carbon-containing gases, viz., CO2, CH2CHO and C2H4. These three carbon- containing gases are chosen because they are frequently observed in various in-situ and post- mortem analyses of cycled LIB [9,29,30,36‚Äì38]. To conclude the study, we compare the obtained thermodynamic and kinetic properties of EC decomposition on pristine and defective ZnO (1010) of this work with previous EC decomposition", "page": 3, "position": 0}

Total electronic energy convergence was achieved by using cutoff energy of 42 Ry for the expansion of Kohn-Sham wavefunctions. Brillouin zone integration for all geometry and electronic structure calculations were performed only at the gamma point considering the large lateral size of the slab used in the present study. We used Hubbard-U correction of 7.5 eV for Zn 3d states following previous study of reduced ZnO with oxygen vacancy [41]. We also considered the dispersion effect for all calculations using semiempirical correction proposed by Grimme (DFT-D2) [42]. 15 √Ö of vacuum region was added to the normal direction of the surface to prevent any spurious interaction between the periodically repeated images of the slab. We used a slab model with eight Zn-O layers with a 4 x 4 lateral size. To model the defective ZnO (1010) surface, we considered two types of point defect, viz., O vacancy (Ovac) and Zn vacancy (Znvac). The two defects were introduced on the topmost layer of the ZnO (1010) surface. Both the pristine and defective ZnO (1010) slab models are shown in Fig 1a-g.

This adsorption configuration is also observed on other layered oxide cathodes, e.g., NCM, LCO and LNO [43,44]. The OC-Znsurf bonding can be further identified by the hybridization between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of EC (composed of some OC 2p states) with the initially empty Znsurf 3d states as shown by the projected electronic density of states (PDOS) (Fig. 3a). Further, Lowdin charge analysis suggests that approximately 0.27e are transferred from the EC to the ZnO upon adsorption. Previous studies also observed another possible adsorption configuration of EC on metal oxide surface where, along with OC-TMsurf (surface transition metal) bonding, the CC also bonds to the surface O (Osurf) of the metal oxide [43,45]. Indeed, we found similar configuration adsorption is also thermodynamically favorable with -0.84 eV adsorption energy (SI Fig S1d).

We also note that the ‚Äòethylene group‚Äô of EC tends to be positioned further from the Ovac site upon adsorption. This is so to minimize the repulsive interaction between the excess electrons residing in reduced Zn near the Ovac with the ethylene group of EC [41,46‚Äì48].

Here, EC adsorbs with a slight offset to the bridges between surface atoms. Under the absence of Zn atom for OE-Zn bonding, EC tilts the same with OE closing to the Zn vacancy location.

While both reactions have similar EC decomposition products, notice that the transition and the final states configurations are different. EC decomposition via reaction A proceeds through simultaneous processes of H1 abstraction and CE2-OE2 ring-opening reaction with 1.39 eV reaction barrier (Fig. 5). The end products are CO2, CH2CHO* (adsorbed on ZnO via OE1-Znsurf bonding) and H*- abstraction (eventually forming a surface hydroxyl). Reaction B proceeds through two steps (Fig. 6). The first step is CC-Osurf bonding with 0.44 eV reaction energy and 0.47 eV activation barrier (calculated with respect to the IS in Fig. 6). This step is similar to EC adsorption configuration found in NMC type cathode material [43].

Further, our results also suggest that thermodynamically favorable EC decomposition reactions are always accompanied by a H- abstraction, i.e., deprotonation. This implies that EC decomposition reaction on ZnO followed the so-called proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) mechanism. This is also consistent with previous result where EC tends to deprotonate upon contact with metal oxides, e.g., TiO2 and Nb2O5 [49]. 3.3. EC Decomposition Paths on ZnO (ùüèùüéùüèùüé) with Ovac and Znvac The schematic of EC decomposition reactions on ZnO (1010) surface with a surface Ovac is shown in Fig. 7. We designated each of the EC decomposition reaction in a similar way to what we have been used in the stoichiometric case (see section 3.2). Herein, in addition to CO2 and CH2CHO, we also included C2H4 as a possible EC decomposition product. Three EC decomposition reactions were considered: the first reaction (reaction D) produced CO2, CH2CHO*, and H*, while the other two reaction paths (reactions E and F) produced CO2/CO2*, C2H4, and adsorption of OC on the Ovac site (thus, ‚Äòhealing‚Äô the vacancy site). The first reaction (reaction D) starts from a similar EC adsorption configuration with reaction A of the stoichiometric surface. The decomposition also proceeds in the same manner as the reaction A where H1-abstraction and CE2-OE2 ring-opening reactions are assumed to occur simultaneously (Fig 8). Our result shows that reaction D is an exothermic reaction with -0.59 eV reaction energy. The calculated activation barrier is 1.23 eV, slightly lower than its identical decomposition reaction occurred on ZnO stoichiometric surface, i.e., reaction A. The second and third reactions (reactions E and F) are shown in Fig. 9 and ESI Fig. S6, respectively. Both reactions have CE1-OE1 bond breaking that leads to ring-opening of EC but differ in the occurrence of deprotonation.

Next, for the case of EC adsorption on ZnO (1010) with a Znvac, we found that ring-opening reaction is unlikely to occur on the Znvac site. Assuming that the ring-opening occurs via the CE2- OE2 bond-breaking (Fig. 10a), repulsive interaction between the OE1 and the nearest two two-fold Osurf (Fig. 2c) prohibits the adsorption of the ring-opened EC. Following the cases of EC decomposition on stoichiometric and Ovac-contained ZnO (1010), we then examined the possibility of EC to reorient its adsorption configuration closer to the nearest Znsurf (designated with ‚Äò0‚Äô in Fig. 10a). Calculated adsorption energies of reoriented EC in the vicinity of Znvac site show almost similar value to the most stable adsorption case (ESI Fig. S3b-d).

Of the three studied reactions in stoichiometric ZnO (1010) case, reaction B has the lowest activation barrier (1.15 eV) and the largest thermodynamic driving force with reaction energy of -1.35 eV. For Ovac- contained ZnO (1010) case, reaction D has the lowest activation energy of 1.23 eV. As for reaction E, it is a two-step reaction with a rate-limiting barrier of 1.28 eV but with the most energetically favored reaction energy (-1.07 eV). For the Znvac-contained ZnO case, we have calculated the reaction G that is a two-step decomposition reaction with 0.96 eV rate-limiting activation barrier and an overall -0.38 eV reaction energy. From the obtained results, we can see that both defects affect the EC decomposition activation barrier. The Ovac (Znvac) slightly increase (decrease) the barrier by 0.08 (0.19 eV) relative to the lowest barrier on the pristine surface, respectively. This makes activation barriers for EC decomposition on pristine and defective ZnO (1010) surfaces range between 0.96-1.23 eV. These results imply that the presence of under-coordinated Zn-O bond (be it in the form of Ovac and Znvac) on ZnO surface may kinetically increase or decrease the decomposition rate of EC compared to the pristine case.

We would like to remind again that all the reactions studied here were assumed to be chemical in nature. This means that any external potential was excluded. Therefore, the data that we have taken to be compared with our results were also calculated with similar condition to ours in order to have a justifiable comparison (i.e., modeled in ultra-high vacuum and without external potential).

However, it should be noted that once the LiCoO2 is in a partially delithiated state, the activation barrier of the ring-opening reaction is significantly decrease by about 1.0 eV [45]. Further, fully-delithiated LCO (LCO (FD)) shows a fast ring-opening reaction of EC with only 0.25 eV activation barrier [45]. This comparison shows that in general, even with the presence of defects, ZnO has the better propensity against surface-mediated catalytic EC decomposition reaction than bare LIB cathode. Our finding is consistent with previous results that showed ZnO- coated cathodes of LIB always have a better capacity retention than LIB with untreated cathode. We also assess our calculated activation barrier of EC decomposition on ZnO with regard to the possible working condition of a LIB. Firstly, we compare the activation barrier of EC on ZnO with an expected activation barrier needed to hinder EC decomposition in an idealized LIB environment. By assuming an Arrhenius reaction rate with prefactor of kbT/h, Xu et al calculated that at least 1.03 eV of a rate-limiting activation barrier is needed to hinder EC decomposition [43]. This value was calculated by taking into account the following assumptions: (1) the working condition of the LIB follows the hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) working condition where at most 10% of the electrolyte are decomposed within one year, (2) the LIB working temperature can be kept constant at T=300 K (within the one year working condition) and (3) the mass percentage of the HEV LIB consists of 27% and 4.4% of cathode and electrolyte, respectively. Comparing the value calculated by Xu et al with our calculated EC decomposition activation barriers, it can be inferred that in general ZnO fulfill the required minimum activation barrier. Secondly, note that a protective coating material for LIB cathode should also facilitate facile Li diffusion.

This is because too high Ovac concentration can also facilitate O migration from the cathode that may trigger other deleterious effect such as phase transformation of the active cathode [28]. 4. Summary We have studied ethylene carbonate adsorption and decomposition reactions on stoichiometric and defective ZnO (1010) surface by means of first-principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Here, we used CO2, C2H4, CH2CHO and H as probing compounds to evaluate the thermodynamic and kinetic of EC decomposition mediated by pristine and defective ZnO (1010). Our results reveal that in the vicinity of Ovac, activation barriers of EC decomposition are higher compared to the decomposition on pristine ZnO (1010), while the reverse is true for Znvac. However, the Znvac-contained ZnO (1010) surface has lesser active sites due to repulsion between OE1 and the nearest two-fold Osurf. Comparison of EC decomposition activation barriers on several LIB cathodes with our results suggests that ZnO has an overall better propensity against EC decomposition than LIB bare cathodes. Furthermore, the lowest activation barrier found for EC on Znvac-contained ZnO (1010) shows a value (0.96 eV) that is close to the minimum required activation barrier to hinder rapid EC decomposition in a LIB working environment (1.03 eV). Our findings suggest that ZnO is a good material for LIB cathode protection, in particular against chemically driven EC decomposition. Finally, our present study can be used as a guideline to further evaluate liquid electrolyte interaction with other candidates of protective coating materials for LIB cathode. We propose that finding a coating material that has good thermodynamic and kinetic stability against the liquid carbonate solvent is also important aside from other criteria such as stability against salt decomposition.
