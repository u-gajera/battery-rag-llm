Harrison Sandia National Laboratories, MS 0750, Albuquerque, NM 87185 ∗kleung@sandia.gov (Dated: March 21, 2024) Abstract Battery interfaces help govern rate capability, safety/stability, cycle life, and self-discharge, but signiﬁcant gaps remain in our understanding at atomic length scales that can be exploited to im- prove interfacial properties. In particular, Li partially plated on copper current collectors, relevant to the anodeless, lithium metal cell which is a holy grail of high density energy battery research, has recently been reported to undergo galvanic corrosion and exhibit short shelf lives. We apply large scale Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy to examine the reaction between the electrolyte and Li|Cu junctions coated with uniform, thin electrolyte interphase (SEI) passivating ﬁlms at two applied voltages. The DFT galvanic corrosion calculations show that electrolyte degradation preferentially occurs on Li-plated regions and should lead to thicker SEI ﬁlms. We ﬁnd similarities but also fundamental diﬀerences between traditional metal localized pitting and Li-corrosion mechanisms due to overpotential and ionic diﬀusion rate disparities in the two cases. Furthermore, using the recently proposed, highly reactive lithium hydride (LiH) component SEI as example, we distinguish between electrochemical and chemical degradation pathways which are partially responsible for self-discharge, with the chemical path- way found to exhibit slow kinetics. We also predict that electric ﬁelds should in general exist across natural SEI components like LiH, and across artiﬁcial SEI ﬁlms like LiI and LiAlO2 often applied to improve battery cycling. Underlying and unifying these predictions is a framework of DFT voltage/overpotential deﬁnitions which we have derived from electrochemistry disciplines like structural metal corrosion studies; our analysis can only be made using the correct electronic voltage deﬁnitions. 1", "page": 0, "position": 0}

INTRODUCTION Lithium (Li) metal anodes represent one of the holy grails of battery research because of its high gravimetric capacity advantage.1 So far, high coulombic eﬃciency2 remains an elusive goal, especially in liquid electrolyte-based batteries which are our focus. Recently self-discharge,3–9 whereby the stored energy in a battery dissipates without generating a current in the external circuit, has been identiﬁed as another potential issue, especially in anodes with three-dimensional architectures.7 Fast self-discharge has been attributed to “galvanic corrosion” which occurs in lithium (Li) plated on copper (Cu) current collectors. Vastly diﬀerent self-discharge rates have been reported,5–8 depending on the amount of Li plated; the degree of self-discharge reversibility also varies. This is surprising because Cu current collectors are widely used, and are usually in contact with Li on one side and the electrolyte on the other side, yet galvanic corrosion has seldom been noted. The lithium galvanic corrosion phenomenon oﬀers a unique opportunity for comparison between traditional (e.g., localized pitting) metal corrosion10 and degradation in lithium battery electrodes.11,12 Metals like aluminum (Al) have low reduction potentials that lie outside the electrolyte (e.g., water) stability window, and has to be passivated with native oxide ﬁlms. Galvanic processes occur when a more electropositive metal is in contact, lead- ing to e−transfer from and enhanced dissolution of the less electronegative metal.13 These aspects have profound similarities with Li metal and other Li-battery anodes11 which are metastable against most electrolytes and are always passivated by solid electrolyte inter- phase (SEI) ﬁlms.16,18–20 Even if Li is scraped clean in a glove box, it is “dirty” in that it immediately getters any oxygen or water in the atmosphere and forms a oxide coating to passivate itself (supporting information document, S.I., Sec. S1). In many cases the SEI ﬁlm is generated by electrochemical reduction of the electrolyte during plating, and/or by subsequent chemical reactions of the initial SEI or electrolyte with the plated lithium metal.16–18 In other cases, artiﬁcial SEIs (aSEIs) are coated directly on Li metal, or ﬁrst on the current collector prior to Li plating,21,22 to improve cycling and self-discharge behavior via improvement of", "page": 1, "position": 0}

For example, Al and steel pitting onset occurs when the passivating oxide ﬁlms break down, partly because of the slow metal cation diﬀusion rates in the oxide. Hence the anodic Al oxidation step is corrosion-limiting, and this is accelerated at higher voltages. Modeling of corrosion of structural corrosion is challenging because corrosion usu- ally involves overpotentials against metal plating (e.g., the mininum Al pitting potential is ∼-0.5 V vs. SHE,109 much higher than the -1.66 V vs. SHE of Al3+ + 3 e−→Al(s)), spatial segregation of cathodic and anodic processes, and kinetics (not only thermodynamic) considerations.10 Li+ diﬀusion is suﬃciently fast in its SEI that overpotentials are less rele- vant, and that cathodic reactions (electrolyte reduction), accelerated at low voltages, might be limiting; we will use DFT and measurements to demonstrate this point. Despite these caveats, we propose that synergistic studies of metal corrosion mitigation and lithium anode protection will yield signiﬁcant, cross-cutting beneﬁts to both ﬁelds. We hypothesize that galvanic corrosion-like eﬀects in Li anodes occur due to quasi-three- point phase boundaries between the Cu current collector, the plated Li, and the electrolyte – with the electrolyte separated from the two metals by a nascent SEI. In this work, we use DFT slab models with up to 3000 atoms (sizes almost unprecedented in previous battery studies) we investigate Cu|Li metal junctions at the nanoscale. 50 % and 100% cover- ages of Cu-current collector by lithium metal are considered (Fig. 1a). Here we exploit a previous established framework in the use of Density Functional Theory (DFT) to model battery interfaces.11 These advances are based on electrochemical modeling paradigms often developed outside of battery research;11,41–48 have been applied to model Al-corrosion;49 in- clude electrochemical voltage/overpotential deﬁnitions; and reveal complexities like electric ﬁeld50 and contact potential11,49,51,52 eﬀects seldom addressed in the battery modeling liter- ature.

The nascent, uniformly-thick SEI ﬁlms in our models are thin enough that they are not considered ﬁnal structures, but can still grow and evolve. This allows us to concentrate on intermediate stage SEI growth and evolution23–26 on top of native or engineered27 oxides generally present on Li metal anodes, unlike prevalent modeling work on pristine Li(s)/liquid electrolyte interfaces mostly relevant to the initial stages of SEI growth.18,28–34,40 We also refrain from making a priori assump- tions about our model systems reaching equilibrium between electronic and ionic properties, unlike previous work which do not address overpotentials.35,36 DFT time scales are short compared to experiments (Supporting Information, SI Sec. S6) which can lead to unin- tentional overpotentials.11 We match possible or experimentally-determined overpotential values during self-discharge/corrosion to DFT (electronic) voltages by tuning the interfacial structure. In other words, we focus on voltage-function relations, not structure-function relations which are less pertinent because atomic length-scale experimental interfacial struc- tures have seldom been elucidated. Kinetics considerations are addressed using both explicit reaction barrier calculations, and separation-of-time-scale approximations. Understanding the chemical and electrochemical stability of SEI ﬁlm components and their reactions with the electrolyte is also relevant to predicting Li “corrosion” processes. Our DFT framework and electronic voltage deﬁnitions11 also permit us to distinguish elec- trochemical vs. chemical electrolyte degradation reactions, both of which can contribute to self-discharge. (Here “chemical” refers to reactions that can occur without an electron source, and includes both energetic and kinetic considerations.) To this end, we adopt as a test case the reactive lithium hydride (LiH), which has surprisingly been reported to exist in the SEI.37–39 We hypothesize that LiH, which is thermodynamically unstable against water, oxygen, and most organic compounds, must exhibit kinetically-limited reactions in order to persist and be observed in the SEI (Fig. 1b). Our work on LiH reveals other complexities that can potentially be exploited to reduce self-discharge. The contact potential between LiH and Li metal is signiﬁcantly lower than that between Li metal and well-known SEI components LiF or Li2O.11 This leads us to survey other materials like LiI and", "page": 3, "position": 0}

The fact that battery electrode interfaces have surface charges and exert electric ﬁelds should be expected because many electriﬁed interfaces only exhibit one “potential of zero charge” (PZC) and should have net charges away from the PZC; neverthless electric ﬁelds in the SEI have mostly been neglected until recently.11,47,50 We illustrate this using cross-ﬁlm Li+ transport in LiAlO2 coated on Li metal (Fig. 1c), and propose that interfacial electric ﬁeld engineering will have beneﬁcial properties.61,62 Our models represent no-current snapshots of SEI growth50 and/or Li self-discharge,6–8 not the entire dynamic “corrosion” process.

However, no standard correction currently exists for dipole/dipole-image interactions in the x-y plane; the consequences will be discussed below. Transition state energies or barriers ∆E∗are computed using the climbing image nudged elastic band method.72 The two- and multilayer SEI models73–75 suggest that inorganic products coat the active anode material, separating it from the thicker, amorphous, and porous organic/polymeric layer outside. More recently, cryogenic transmission electron microcopy (cryo-TEM) images suggest an amorphous matrix in contact with Li metal, in which Li2O and LiF nanoparticles are embedded in some electrolytes.76–78 While the chemical identity of the armophous phase has not been revealed by TEM, candidates that are stable against Li metal are extremely limited.79 A recent demonstration of reactions between Li2CO3 and Li metal surfaces sug- gests this matrix may contain graphitic carbon with Li intercalated arising from multistep electrochemical reduction of organic electrolyte and their intermediate products, includ- ing Li2CO3.80 Since graphitic carbon is metallic and does not block e−, here we focus on Li2O27,75 and other insulating inorganic SEI products as the inner SEI layer (S.I. Sec. S1). The organic SEI outside the inorganic SEI has complex, heterogeneous compositions and structure, and likely exhibits a low dielectric constant. As before,11,51 we approximate the outer organic SEI as a vacuum. Our implicit assumption is that, to ﬁrst order, all the electric ﬁelds and voltage drops are contained within the inorganic SEI (or aSEI). To the extent that the low dielectric constant organic SEI is common to all interfacial systems considered in this work, its eﬀects on DOL reactivity on diﬀerent Li2O-covered surfaces should largely cancel.Organic SEI and liquid electrolyte eﬀects will be investigated in future work.41 Due to the approximations used in this work (thickness of material slabs, ﬁnite DFT accuracy, omission of organic SEI and electrolyte regions), the properties predicted are semi-quantitative. However, the well-deﬁned approximations in our models provide a path towards future systematic improvements.

(Here “registry” refers to how the surface unit cells of the two materials are aligned or spatially oﬀset in the x-y plane.) LiI, Li2O, and LiH exhibit weak interactions with Li metal surfaces (although the contact potential can still be large); the precise registry is not critical, and only one choice each is used. Unless otherwise noted, one Li atom is inserted directly below each anion on the inner surface of the inorganic ﬁlms (i.e., I−in LiI, O2−in Li2O, and H−in LiH). This Li “interlayer” has been found to lower the electronic voltage (Ve, Eq. 2 below) and is either thermoneutral or exothermic at some interfaces, after subtracting the Li metal cohesive energy (i.e., Vi>0 V, Eq. 1 below).51 Other details of the interface models are given in Table S3 (S.I.). When doubling or quadrupling simulation cells for system size convergence purposes, we start from the converged conﬁgurations of the baseline cells (S.I. Table S3). For LiAlO2, where a signiﬁcant binding energy with Li metal is expected, we have at- tempted a diﬀerent procedure. We displace the Li metal slab against the oxide in a x-y grid of increment 0.5 ˚A, optimize the conﬁgurations, and select the most stable of the 81 result- ing registries. The computed standard deviation in interfacial energy is ±0.02 J/m2. After this grid search, it is necessary to further conduct ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) T=450 K for 9 ps, followed by a quench from T=450 K to T=50 K over 4 ps and then an energy minimzation calculation, to obtain the ﬁnal Li/LiAlO2 conﬁguration. Without AIMD annealing, the introduction of Li-vacancies, needed to model Li diﬀusion energies, leads to very signiﬁcant reconstructions at the interface. Experimentally, aSEI/Li(s) inter- faces are in many cases created by ﬁrst forming the aSEI on Cu and then plating Li metal underneath the aSEI. How much of this room temperature process is qualitatively consistent with our “cold press,” “light annealing” short AIMD trajectory approach will be considered in future work.

Physically, Ve is to be compared with the volt- age measured or controlled using potentiostats, with necessary caveats about the diﬀerent time scales involved in DFT and experimental overpotentials given in the S.I. (Sec. S6). Ve depends on the k-point sampling and material slab thicknesses, and reported values herein are precise to ∼0.1 V. We stress that Vi and Ve values are referenced to Li+/Li(s).

Only relative values of φ(x) are relevant. Within ground state DFT, each metal, metal alloy, and metal junction slab has a single EF, and hence a unique Ve, even if local variations in φ(x) can occur.51 In DFT slabs, there can be two Ve per metal slab because the front and back sides (coated with surface ﬁlms or not) can have diﬀerent vacuum levels which are split by the artiﬁal dipole sheet that keeps the vacuum free of electric ﬁelds.71 We only report Ve on the side of the coated Li slab, unless otherwise stated.

This thickness should still allow electron leakage through the ﬁlm.83 Hence we do not consider Marcus theory for long-range e−transfer,60,83–86 or non-adiabatic eﬀects.87 Finally, there are fundamental disconnects between the battery and other electrohemical computational literature concerning voltage deﬁnitions and electric ﬁelds/electric double layers (EDL), at the interfaces of both liquid and solid electrolytes.11,49,50,81,88–100 The S.I.

DOL Reductive Decomposition on Coated Li Metal To demonstrate the basic science and DFT system size eﬀects involved, we ﬁrst consider the reaction of 1,3-dioxolane (DOL) on pure Li2O-coated Li metal surfaces. DOL is a cyclic ether frequently used as a co-solvent in Li metal anode batteries.101 It is chosen as the sole adsorbed solvent for computational convenience; its ring structure requires less exploration of the conﬁguration space than linear molecules like 1,2-dimethoxyethane (DME).

This suggests that DOL electrochemical reduction most likely initiates on the electrode surface, where e−transfer to DOL should be more favored via surface stabilization eﬀects. Note that the electrolyte anion is in fact more readily reduced than the ether solvent, although organic SEI components are also found (S.I. Sec. S1). The higher anion reactivity makes it more diﬃcult to distinguish Ve eﬀects in our proof-of-principle calculations, and DOL is chosen instead. In the following we focus on concerted electron transfer and DOL decomposition reaction on inorganic SEI surfaces; the DOL is assumed to be embedded in the low-dielectric organic SEI, not the solvent. We do not focus on its reduction potential, only the initial DOL bonding-breaking event. The chemical constituent of DOL-based SEI has not yet been completely elucidated.102,103 Thus, DOL is meant as a stand-in for the 10", "page": 9, "position": 0}

Fig. 2a-b depict an intact and a decomposed DOL on a ∼10 ˚A thick Li2O ﬁlm on the Li (001) metal surface. Bader charge analysis104 reveals that the DOL with one broken bond is doubly reduced. Table I shows that, in the largest simulation cell considered, the energy released is ∆E=- 1.72 eV, while the reaction barrier is ∆E∗=+0.67 eV, in reasonable agreement with the ∼0.6 eV computed in liquid using a diﬀerent DFT method.103 The latter translates into a sub-second reaction time scale using standard kinetic equations with a 1012/s prefactor.11 As battery interfaces are usually governed by kinetics, not thermodynmics, ∆E∗is more signiﬁcant than ∆E as long as the converged exhibits ∆E<0 (exothermic reaction). Next we discuss the convergence of ∆E and ∆E∗with system size. Adsorption of an intact DOL does not entail e−transfer and should not change Ve signiﬁcantly. For the decomposed DOL, the two e−transfer from Li metal to the molecule leads to an artiﬁcial increase of the dipole moment in the charge-neutral simulation cell, and a signiﬁcant increase in Ve (Eq. 2-3). Thus ∆Ve, deﬁned as the diﬀerence in Ve between the slabs with decomposed and intact DOL, is a measure of system size dependence; it should converge to zero in the limit of inﬁnite system size. ∆Ve can be as large as 2.08 V in slabs with small lateral dimenions (Table I). As the cell size increases, Ve drops to 0.14 V. Simultaneously, ∆E increases in magnitude from -0.85 eV in a 1×1 cell (17.0×9.9 ˚A2 lateral area, S.I.

Cu|Li Junction: Work Function The above discussion lays the ground work for examining DOL electrochemical reduction on the Li|Cu junction. Here we report the computational results and defer discussions of relevance to corrosion to the next subsection. First we distinguish two types of junctions. Fig. 2c depicts a layer of Li (001) covering Cu (001). This model mimics complete Li-plating on a Cu current collector. In contrast, Fig. 3a depicts a junction between Li and Cu metal in the x direction. It mimics partial, ∼50 %, Li plating on a Cu current collector. For the Fig. 2c conﬁguration, the work functions on the Li and Cu sides of the simulation cells are 3.01 eV and 4.48 eV, which translate into Ve=1.63 V and Ve=3.11 V, respectively. These values are similar to those of pure Li and Cu metals with such facets; the <0.1 eV discrepancy with published results51 is due to the thinness of the slabs and the small strain on the Cu, lattice matched to Li. The similarity with bare Li and Cu is in this case expected because electrostatic screening length is on the order of Angstroms within metals, and the eﬀect of the junction should be screened out. The existence of two vacuum level is a DFT artifact,71 and should be interpreted as follows. The exposed Li and Cu surfaces are electrically disconnected; they can be tuned to a common Ve via modifying their independent EDL’s. Fig. 2d further depicts a Li2O (111) slab coating the Li (001) surface on Cu(111).

Next, we put a ∼10 ˚A-thick Li2O layer on the metal and optimize the atomic conﬁguration (Fig. 3b, henceforth the “oxide 1” model). We predict Ve=0.85 V for this system. Joining Cu with Li has therefore raised Ve by 0.80 V relative to Fig. 2a. At Ve>0 V, the Li metal is metastable; however, the simulation cell lacks a liquid electrolyte that can accommodate Li+ or a simulation time scale needed for dissolution to occur, and the Li slab remains. The diﬀerence between the Cu-maximum and the Li-minimum is reduced to 0.39 eV in the simulation cells with the largest vacuum region (Fig. 3e), but remains signiﬁcant. Finally, we ﬁnd that adding 14 additional “interlayer” Li atoms beneath the Li2O ﬁlm on the Cu side (Table S3 in the S.I.), with each Li directly coordinated to a O anion at the interface, lowers Ve to 0.01 V,51 which is almost at i-equilibrium (Ve=Vi=0.0 V, Fig. 3c). (Again, Ve is well converged with respect to the z-dimension of the the simulation cell; increasing the cell size by 14 ˚A reduces Ve only by 0.03 V; henceforth we report the 0.01 V value.) This model is referred to as “oxide 2.” We stress that, for this model, we have managed to change Ve signiﬁcantly by only altering the contact potential (SI Sec.

In other words, Li insertion into these interface sites is thermodynamically favorable at or below 0.57 V, although we have not examined all possible Li conﬁgurations, and the estimated Vi is approximate. Creation of this interlayer should occur when the instantaneous voltage is Ve=0.01 V (Fig. 3c) when the interlayer is thermodynamically favored, but not at 0.85 V (Fig. 3b). Strictly speaking, adding 18 Li at the interface is found to be most consistent with Vi=0.0 V, but this yields Ve=-0.16 V (SI Sec. S10). Here we neglect this slight discrepancy in Ve.

Fig. 3d-f emphasize the existence of spatial electrostatic heterogeneity on metal electrode surfaces. Local voltage variation of up to 0.3 V during charge has been measured for graphite anodes.106 This variation has been entirely attributed to kinetic limitations/ohmic losses; our predictions suggest that structural origins may also need to be explored. C. Interpretations of Cu|Li Junction Work Functions Our calculations show that a 100% Li2O(111)-coated Li(001) slab (Fig. 2a without a DOL) exhibits a similar work function as the same composite slab deposited on Cu (001) (Fig. 2d). This suggests that, on copper current collectors completely covered with plated Li metal (Fig. 2c-d), and therefore without a electrolyte/Li/Cu 3-phase junction, the Li/Cu contact has no eﬀect on electron transfer. Hence galvanic corrosion should not occur. This inference is consistent with Ref. 7 and 8. Next we consider the horizontal Li|Cu slabs. The “galvanic corrosion” concept is arguably most relevant in ﬁeld deployment environments (e.g., on ships13) where the overall metal voltage (Ve) is not controlled. In such conditions, we expect that creating a junction of two metals with diﬀerent electronegativities raises Ve above that of the more electronegative metal alone, at least prior to any induced electrochemical reaction that has occurred and has led to changes in Ve.107 This is indeed the situation for the oxide 1 model, where the three phase junction between Li2O, Li, and the more electropositive Cu raises the voltage from the Ve=0.05 V value at the pure Li2O/Li interface (Fig. 2) to 0.85 V at the mixed interface (Fig. 3b). Li dissolution, and pitting through the oxide, would be accelerated at this higher Ve. This scenario would be consistent with standard galvanic corrosion.13 Note that Li+ dissolution requires", "page": 14, "position": 0}

At this onset, the passivating oxide is ruptured and Al3+ can readily dissolve. However, we argue that Fig. 3e is less relevant than Fig. 3f in batteries. Li+ diﬀuses much more readily in the SEI passivating ﬁlm than Al3+ in its oxide without the need of ﬁrst rupturing the SEI ﬁlm. The lowering of kinetic constraint means that the anode should be near its equilibrium potential. Indeed, our measurements show that the Li-stripping occurs without signiﬁcant over-voltage (Ve∼0 V) (Fig. 3g-h), quantitatively similar to “oxide 2,” and is not at 0.85 V. This should be true in recent battery experiments as well.6–8 In that sense, oxide 1 (Fig. 4b) is a hypothetical, standard “galvanic corrosion” scenario that assumes that Li+ motion in the SEI is as slow as Al3+ in alumina. Oxide 2, where Ve∼0 V at room temperature, is more relevant to battery experiments (Fig. 3g-h). Even in this case, the DFT-predicted work function and local electrostatic potential −|e|φ(x) remain lower on the Li side of the Li|Cu metal junction (Fig. 3f). The expected transfer of e−from the Li side to the Cu side due to their diﬀerence in electronegativity reduces the diﬀerence in −|e|φ(x) arising from the pure Li and Cu metal work function diﬀerence, but does not eliminate or reverse it. For a Cu|Al metal junction, ﬁnite element simulations have also predicted local voltage increase on the more electropositive Cu side.105 This is qualitatively simillar to Fig. 3d-f, although the variation is much smaller, likely because an electric current exists in the model of Ref. 105, and ohmic eﬀects cannot be neglected. A more direct connection between metal corrosion (“oxide 1”), and SEI at a substantial potential (∼0.85 V), may however be made using passive anodes without Li content.112 SEI forms preferentially at lower voltages and metal dissolution into cations (e.g., via pitting) preferentially occurs at higher voltages.", "page": 15, "position": 0}

In the oxide 2 model (Fig. 4c), the −|e|φ(x) variation in Fig. 3f suggests that, if the SEI thickness are the same on both Cu and Li sides, the Li side is at a <0.0 V potential. This suggests that the partially plated Li-regions in recent experimental work6–8 suppress Li dissolution via destruction of the passivating ﬁlm (pitting-like corrosion), while electrolyte electrochemical reduction is enhanced. The Li- plated region is preferentially the cathode (electrochemically reducing electrolyte). “Pitting” does not occur in the Li-plated region; instead Li+ dissolution may occur at the Li|Cu junction or on the Cu-side where the ﬁnal SEI is thinner.

However, the Ref. 6 analyses are performed after the SEI is fully formed, at which point the Li-side SEI is thicker than that on the Cu- side (unlike in our models) and SEI formation is more kinetically limited. Our argument concerning −|e|φ(x) does not need to be altered to make this connection to the experimental work. SEI formation reactions will be explicitly examined in the next sections. Thus we caution against a too-literal identiﬁcation of traditional corrosion/galvanic cor- rosion concept in aqueous electrolytes with Li self-discharge. Future local voltage measure- ments in Li-plated and non-plated Cu current collectors, e.g., by using scanning Kelvin probe force microscopy, will be valuable to conﬁrm this point. Note that the experimental voltage (Fig. 3g-h) is slightly but measurably higher for a sample where Li has been plated on Cu at a very low capacity than when plated at higher capcity, especially at longer times. See the S.I. (Sec. S2) for details. The <0.01 V diﬀerence at early times cannot be resolved in current DFT calculations. At the lower Li capacity, we expect the large Cu surface area relative to the amount of plated Li to lead to rampant self- discharge. This suggests that when signiﬁcant self-discharge occurs, the open circuit voltage is higher than the Li stripping potential of 0.0 V, which accelerates Li+ dissolution. This is in qualitative agreement with the oxide 1 model, although we stress that “oxide 1” is not meant to be physical, and the experimentally measured voltage is not as high as the 0.85 V.

Two-electron DOL decomposition is more favorable by ∆E=-1.15 eV on the Li-side versus -0.65 eV on the Cu-side in the largest supercells examined (Table I). The ∆E diﬀerence between the two sides is 0.50 eV, reasonably close in magnitude than 2|e| times the 0.16 eV variation in −|e|φ(x) (Fig. 3f); the latter is meant as a qualitative guide for explicit e−transfer reactions. In contrast, the oxide 1 model exhibits a signiﬁcantly higher overall (Ve=0.85 V), which should impede DOL reductive decomposition that leads to SEI-formation. Indeed, ∆E=+0.31 eV and +0.87 eV on the Li- and Cu-sides, respectively in the largest cells con- sidered (Table I). The ∆E discrepancy between the Li and Cu sides on the oxide 1 model is qualitatively consistent with the larger −|e|φ(x) variation (Fig. 3e), but again φ(x) does not quantitatively describes the ∆E diﬀerence. The reaction barriers ∆E∗for the forward reaction are irrelevant on “oxide 1” surfaces because the reactions are endothermic at the Ve=0.85 V voltage there, and DOL decompo- sition should not occur. However, the reverse reaction, namely reconstitution of intact DOL molecules, is energetically downhill, and the reverse ∆E∗are lower than 1.0 eV (Table I). This implies reaction time scales of at most 1 hour when using standard kinetic prefactors in Arrhenius rate estimates at T=300 K. ∆E∗for DOL decomposition in the largest simulation cell used is 0.80 eV (Table I), which indicates that the reaction is fast relative to battery cycling (∼1-hour) time scales.

Interpretations of Solvent Reduction at Cu|Li Junction Our calculations suggest that the main “galvanic” eﬀect of the Li|Cu junction is to en- hance SEI formation on Li-plated regions over Cu regions. This is a cathodic reaction-driven process, distinct from traditional Al/steel pitting corrosion. We stress that SEI ﬁlms are thin (∼10 ˚A) in our models, and are not yet completely passivating, unlike in experiments where the inorganic SEI on the Li-side is completed and is reported not increase in thickness during subsequent Li dissolution in cryo-TEM measurements, at least for some cycles.6 In our models, more favorable DOL decomposition enthalpy (∆E’s) are predicted on the Li side of Cu|Li junctions in both oxide 1 and oxide 2 at the same Li2O thickness. This enhanced tendency on Li, when the Li2O thickness is the same on both sides, is consistent with the thicker (∼15 nm) SEI ultimately formed on Li compared to that on Cu (∼5-8 nm).6 Measurement of SEI thickness on the Cu side as Li self-discharge proceeds would be valuable in future studies. Although we have focused on initial DOL decomposition reactions and have not explored ultimate SEI products, the diﬀerent values of ∆E and ∆E∗predicted on the Li and Cu sides may be consistent with the diﬀerent SEI compositions in the two types of regions.6 Indeed, the SEI formation potential has been reported to aﬀect SEI composition and properties on other substrates.25 See the S.I.", "page": 19, "position": 0}

H−is in its lowest possible charge state and, like other inorganic SEI components Li2O and LiF, LiH should be thermodynamically stable against Li metal. But unlike those components, LiH is a strong reducing agent that should react chemically with organic SEI and electrolyte components, even in the absence of an e− source. Thus, apart from the inherent interest in LiH within the SEI, this material serves as a model system to diﬀerentiate chemical versus electrochemical reactions with the electrolyte during SEI evolution, late-stage SEI growth, or self-discharge.

Alumina can be coated on Cu current collectors, or directly on Li surfaces, to create aSEIs.8,21,22 Upon cycling, it has been proposed that alumina reacts to form mixed Al/Li oxides.21,22,108 We focus on the mixed oxide candidate LiAlO2.60 LiAlO2 is not thermody- namically stable against Li metal; its Al3+ can be reduced. However, we ﬁnd that its (100) surface is kinetically stable on Li(001) upon optimization of the interfacial conﬁguration (Fig. 6a), even after a short AIMD run (Method). In contrast, LiI,34 like LiH, has a maxi- mally reduced anion which cannot react with Li metal (Fig. 6b). The electronic voltages Ve associated with the two interfaces in Fig. 6a-b are +0.63 V and 25", "page": 24, "position": 0}

If a liquid electrolyte were present, Li metal would start to dissolve as Li+ until i- equilibrium is achieved via surface charging. These values further conﬁrm that the LiF- and Li2O-coated Li metal near-“open circuit” conditions are fortuitous exceptions. Despite this, the computed Ve associated with LiAlO2/Li(s) and LiI/Li(s) interfaces remain signiﬁcantly lower than the DFT/PBE predicted bare lithium “voltage” of ∼1.56 V11,51 due to the ﬁnite contact potentials. Once again, we emphasize that extra eﬀort is needed to keep DFT model systems at i-equilibrium, non-overpotential conditions. Charge-neutral Li2CO3-coated Li surfaces have been predicted to exhibit Ve∼0.6 V;47 however, Li2CO3 is in fact not stable on Li surfaces.79,80 The local densities of state (LDOS) plots in the S.I. (Sec. S3) illustrate the interfacial band structures. By construction, the interfaces are not charged, and as expected, in the insulating SEI/aSEI regions, the valence band edges (VBE) are ﬂat. We have also performed spot-checks of the LiI Ve with the more accurate HSE06 functional. The latter increases Ve by 0.10 V compared to PBE predicitons (S.I. Sec. S3); this would also be the magnitude of the change in contact potential. To illustrate the eﬀect of contact potentials which do not give Ve=0.0 V, we consider Li+ diﬀusion at the Li/LiAlO2 interface. First, we attempt to attain a voltage closer to 0.0 V vs. Li+/Li(s) than 0.63 V. This requires a positively charged surface which induces a negative charge on the Li metal surfaces, and creates a surface dipole (Eq. 3) and an electric ﬁeld across the LiAlO2 ﬁlm. The ﬁeld inside LiAlO2 is the sole contribution to the EDL in our model. Changing the EDL by increasing the cation surface concentration is also the way voltage is lowered in modeling pristine electrodes/liquid electrolyte interfaces.88 In Fig. 7c, we artiﬁcially substitute one or two O atoms with ﬂuorine (F) near the LiAlO2/vacuum interface in 1×2 or 1×4 supercells respectively. This reduces Ve from 0.63 V to 0.31 V, much closer to equilibrium Li-plating/stripping conditions. The LDOS (Fig.", "page": 25, "position": 0}

The Li+ vacancy energy cost (∆ELi−vac) decreases with distance from the inner surface (except the vacancy closest to the Li metal surface, which is an outlier). The S.I. (Sec. S7) shows that, without F-substitution such that Ve=0.63 V, the reverse trend is observed; Li+ vacancy costs increase with increasing distance from the metal surface. This trend suggests that, for this Li/LiAlO2 interface, as the voltage further decreases towards i-equilibrium (Ve=0.0 V), ∆ELi−vac should decrease with distance from the Li/LiAlO2 interace even faster than Fig. 7d. In other words, Li+ stripping from the Li metal anode through this ﬁlm should exhibit a more favorable energy landscape than Li-plating, as long as only Li+ vacancies in LiAlO2, and not positively charged Li-interstitials, are involved. Such an asymmetry has seldom been documented at battery interface because ﬁnite electric ﬁelds are diﬃcult to measure and have been largely neglected in DFT calculations. However, it may contribute to deviation of Li plating/stripping exchange current ratio from unity.114 We have not computed Li+ diﬀusion barriers, but those should also be aﬀected by an electric ﬁeld. A ﬁeld that hinders Li+ vacancy diﬀusion towards the liquid elecrolyte in the SEI should reduce self- discharge. This would require a large, positive contact potential between Li metal and the surface ﬁlm, so that at Ve=0.0 V the Li/ﬁlm interface is positively charged. Thus electric ﬁelds may be exploited to accelerate charging/discharge rate. Surprisingly, ∆ELi−vac are well-converged with system size (Fig. 7)d. This is unlike the case without F-substitution on the LiAlO2 surface (S.I.), or with Li2O ﬁlms Fig. 4. Normally this lack of system size dependence would be the signature of an uncharged point defect.49 However, the LDOS (Fig. 7b) shows that a vacancy generates new VBE states, which are signatures of a negatively charged defect. We postulate that the partially occupied surface states are responsible for fast convergence (Fig. 7a-b). While the good system size conver- gence is computationally convenient, the existence of surface states is not physical; they should readily react with organic", "page": 26, "position": 0}

Using DFT methods and these models with explicit interfaces, we show that these Li|Cu junctions exhibit signiﬁcant spatial inhomogeneity with respect to local electrostatic poten- tials. DOL electrochemical reduction reactions are more favorable and faster on the Li side of oxide-coated junction. This suggests that solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) ﬁlms form more readily on the Li region than the Cu region, if the SEI ﬁlm has the same thickness on both regions. This is in qualitative agreement with the experimental ﬁnding that the ﬁnal SEI on is thicker Li-coated regions under lithiun metal anode “galvanic corrosion” con- ditions. A 100% Li-coated Cu surface does not exhibit such an inhomogeneity or galvanic corrosion signatures. 28", "page": 27, "position": 0}

The electrochemical degradation process has a reasonably low reaction barrier consistent with about one second reaction time scales. The chemical route, while exother- mic, has a surprisingly high barrier. This suggests that LiH may persist in electronically disconnected regions of the SEI despite its thermodynamic instability. If LiH is continu- ously formed in the SEI, it may continuously react electrochemically and deplete Li metal, which becomes relevant to battery self-discharge. Finally, we demonstrate that LiAlO2, a model for artiﬁcial SEI (aSEI) on Li metal, should exhibit a cross-ﬁlm electric ﬁeld when held at the plating/stripping potential (0.0 V vs. Li+/Li(s)). The ﬁeld direction implies that the plating/stripping rates are intrinsically asymmetric. This feature can potentially be exploited to limit self-discharge batteries. Our predictions are made possible by previous conceptual advances in DFT modeling of battery interfaces. These include voltage deﬁnitions (ionic/equilibrium, Vi vs. elec- tronic/instantaneous, Ve), DFT overpotential concepts (Vi̸=Ve), accounting for contact po- tentials between lithium metal and the inorganic SEI/aSEI, and including an electric ﬁeld across the surface ﬁlm to constrain the system at a particular Ve. Ve, proportional to the Fermi level, is shown to be the key determinant of electrochemical reaction energetics when long-range e−transfer is involved; the ionic, equilibrium voltage Vi, related to Li-insertion energies, is only indirectly relevant. Calculating Ve is also critical for avoiding unintentional overpotential in DFT calculations that may lead to erroneous comparison with measure- ments. We ﬁnd that diﬀerent artiﬁcial SEI or SEI components (Li2O, LiAlO2, LiI, and LiH) exhibit signiﬁcantly diﬀerent contact potentials. This means that, at the same applied voltage and ﬁlm thickness, they would exhibit electric ﬁelds with diﬀerent magnitudes across the ﬁlms. From this and from our previous work,11,51,111 we postulate that electric ﬁelds have weak inﬂuence on chemical reactions between Li metal and the SEI/aSEI which are directly in contact; are more important for Li+ transport in the surface ﬁlm and may therefore aﬀect the stripping/plating rate ratio", "page": 28, "position": 0}

Understanding how such ﬁelds (and the accompanying potential drops/rises) are partitioned among the surface ﬁlms, the liquid electrolyte, and the contact potentials is an urgent need that requires further research. In general, battery interfacial stability, related to cycling as well as self-discharge, is found to be far more complex than purely thermodynamic/phase diagram approaches, or standard galvanic corrosion models for metal corrosion, have postulated. While our conclu- sions are based on somewhat idealized models, we stress that for SEI formation reactions via long-range electron transfer, the voltage is critical. Indeed we focus on voltage-function relations rather than interface structure-function relations because the atomic details of in- terfaces have seldom been imaged. There are fundamental diﬀerences between Li metal self-discharge and corrosion/galvanic corrosion of metals like steel or aluminum, due to dif- ferences in voltage dependence and cation diﬀusion rate in oxides. Onset of pitting through breaching of the passivating ﬁlm at elevated voltages relative to Li-plating is not required in Li self-discharge, unlike in pitting corrosion of Al or steel; indeed high potential impedes the cathodic reactions that lead to Li self-discharge. The diﬀerent corrosion mechanisms mean diﬀerent mitigating strategies should be applied. Nevertheless, we propose that synergistic study of battery interfaces and metal corrosion will yield signiﬁcant cross-cutting beneﬁts.
