E-mail: mpemanzh@nus.edu.sg (SM). The transition temperature between the low-temperature alpha phase of tin to beta tin is close to the room temperature (Tαβ =130C), and the difference in cohesive energy of the two phases at 0 K of about ∆Ecoh=0.02 eV/atom is at the limit of the accuracy of DFT (density functional theory) with available exchange-correlation functionals. It is however critically important to model the relative phase energies correctly for any reasonable description of phenomena and technologies involving these phases, for example, the performance of tin electrodes in electrochemical batteries. Here, we show that several commonly used and converged DFT setups using the most practical and widely used PBE functional result in ∆Ecoh≈0.04 eV/atom, with different types of basis sets and with different models of core electrons (all-electron or pseudopotentials of different types), which leads to a significant overestimation of Tαβ. We show that this is due to the errors in relative positions of s and p –like bands, which, combined with different populations of these bands in α and β Sn, leads to overstabilization of alpha tin. We show that this error can be effectively corrected by applying a Hubbard +U correction to s –like states, whereby correct cohesive energies of both α and β Sn can be obtained with the same computational scheme. We quantify for the first time the effects of anharmonicity on ∆Ecoh and find that it is negligible. Introduction Tin (Z=50) is part of the group IV materials. Similarly to its lighter counterparts (C, Si, and Ge), Sn exists in the diamond- type crystal structure, commonly called alpha Sn (α-Sn, space group 227; Fd-3m) or grey tin; this is the most stable low- temperature phase, and it is a zero-gap semiconductor.1 Unlike C, Si, and Ge, however, the diamond structure of Sn is only stable under 286 K (13°C), above which Sn transforms to beta Sn (β-Sn, space", "page": 0, "position": 0}

The relatively low transition temperature Tαβ is reflective of an only slight stabilization of α Sn over β Sn at 0 K (estimated at about ∆Ecoh=0.02 eV/atom), so that relatively small vibrational contributions are required to reverse the phase stability. The proximity of Tαβ to room temperature means that the α−β transition can be of practical importance, as the relative phase stability can be easily changed by perturbations to the lattice by e.g. doping or strain. An example of a technology where this transition has been found important are electrochemical batteries. Tin has been shown to be a high capacity anode material for Li, Na, and Mg ion batteries.2-5 Specifically in Li ion batteries, for which Sn- based electrodes have been most studied,6,7 the formation of α Sn upon lithiation of (initially β phase) Sn electrodes has been reported in experimental studies.8,9 This beta-to-alpha phase transformation in battery electrodes is still not fully understood. To produce reliable ab initio models of this process or other processes which can affect the phase stability at room temperature, the transition temperature and therefore ∆Ecoh need to be reproduced accurately. The practical approach to ab initio modelling of solids is DFT (density functional theory) with PBC (periodic boundary conditions), and GGA (generalized gradient approximation)10 with the PBE (Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof)11 functional is the most practical and widely used approximation to the exchange-correlation functional.12,13 Hybrid functionals14,15 can be used with small simulation cells16 but are increasingly unwieldy for larger supercells which are required to study doping, intercalation, and interfaces.

Previous DFT simulations reported ∆Ecoh of 0.022-0.047 eV/atom.17,18 Below, we show that converged calculations using the PBE functional and different types of basis sets and core electron treatment invariably result in ∆Ecoh≈0.04 eV/atom. This leads to an overestimation of Tαβ by more than 100 K if the harmonic approximation for the phononic contribution is used and is therefore not suited for modelling near-room temperature behaviour of tin-based materials. The transition temperature is the temperature at which the sum of the electronic (𝐸𝐷𝐷𝐷) and of the vibrational energy (𝐸𝑣𝑣𝑣) and entropy (−𝑇𝑇) contributions, 𝐺= 𝐸𝐷𝐷𝐷+ (𝐸𝑣𝑣𝑣−𝑇𝑇), (1) is equal in the two phases.

This means that the error in Tαβ can come either from the error in electronic energy or/and in the vibrational contribution, on the order of 0.02 eV/atom. The difference in vibrational contribution to G at the experimental transition temperature between alpha and beta Sn is around 0.024 eV based on GGA DFT and the harmonic approximation (see below). With an accurate computational setup, each of the two terms of Eq. (1) should therefore be exact to within a few meV, and not within a few dozen meV as is the case with the standard setup using the PBE functional and the harmonic approximation. It is also clear that an accurate setup must be able to model correctly both α and β Sn simultaneously to model systems where the phase transition is possible. It means that fixes such as selecting the degree of exact exchange15,19 or Hubbard (+U) corrections20 that tune the cohesive energy and band structure with parameters different for the two phases are not useful. In this paper, we investigate the origin of the error in Tαβ and identify a computational scheme that fixes it. We analyse both the electronic and the phononic contributions to free energy. Specifically, for the first time, we analyse the effect of anharmonicity of vibrations of bulk tin on relative phase stability; it is shown to be unimportant. We show that the computed ∆Ecoh of about 0.04 eV is ubiquitous across DFT setups using localized or plane wave based basis sets and full ionic potential or pseudopotentials. We trace the origin of the error in the electronic energy to destabilization of the energy of the s band vs the p band and show that the correct ∆Ecoh can be obtained by applying a Hubbard +U correction to the atomic-part s orbitals, with which absolute and relative cohesive energies of both alpha and beta tin can be accurately modelled with one and the same computational setup.

When using pseudopotentials, the valence configuration was 5s25p2; the effect of the addition of the 4d electrons to the valence shell was found to be insignificant. Spin polarized calculations were used where spin polarization is important (i.e. tin atoms and dimers) and spin restricted where it is not (i.e. bulk phases). The VASP21 calculations were performed using a PAW (projector-augmented wave) pseudopotential25 and a plane wave energy cutoff of 300 eV.

The onset of anharmonicity around room temperature (corresponding to 𝑉≈2.5 eV) can be visually appreciated. Does it significantly contribute to relative phase stability? In the classical limit (i.e. all 𝑣𝑖→0) there would be no effect of anharmonicity and coupling in the potential on relative phase stability, while in the limit of large 𝑣𝑖 (specifically, when 𝑣𝑖≫𝑘𝐵𝑇), changes in 𝑣𝑖 would directly contribute to changes in G.

We therefore conclude that anharmonicity and coupling of tin vibrations are not the cause of the overestimation of Tαβ reported in the previous subsection and that ∆Ecoh must be overestimated by DFT. Analysis of electronic structure To understand why there is persistent overestimation of ∆Ecoh with GGA DFT (PBE functional) regardless of the type of the basis set or pseudopotential, we turn to the differences in electronic structure between alpha and beta Sn and analyse how well they are modelled by DFT. From the Mulliken population analysis (performed with atom-centered basis set calculations in SIESTA), we find that α Sn has a higher degree of transfer of electrons from s to p population than β Sn when forming bonds in bulk tin: the s population in α Sn is about 1.5e and in β Sn about 1.7e (to compare to 2.0e in a free atom, as per the valence shell configuration 5s25p2). The differences in s vs p population directly contribute to the total energy, and thereby to ∆Ecoh, via the bandstructure component of the total energy. The population of orbitals with d character upon bulk formation is found to be insignificant. Fig. 4 shows projected density of states for both phases of tin. In Table 2, we compare the average energies of s and p bands (computed as population-weighted energies of states with s and p character) and the difference between them (p-s “gap”) in a Sn atom and in Sn2 dimers computed with DFT to those computed with CCSD(T) as a reference.

More importantly, the s –like level is destabilized by a larger amount, and therefore the p-s gap is lower than with CCSD(T). When bonds are formed between tin atoms, in CCSD(T), the s band energy is lowered by 0.83 eV while the p band energy is slightly raised by 0.1 eV. In the DFT calculations, both s and p levels are stabilized by bonding, and p levels are stabilized more than s levels. This qualitative difference is observed in the DFT calculations in all Gaussian 09, VASP, and SIESTA and is therefore not an artefact caused by a specific computational setup. In the periodic codes, we have confirmed that the s and p level energies are converged to within 0.01 eV in SIESTA and 0.025 eV in VASP with respect to the size of the cubic supercell (total energies and s-p gaps are converged much faster with respect to cell size than eigenvalues).

The plot is up to the Fermi level. If the stronger destabilization of s vs p band with DFT using the PBE functional which is observed in a Sn atom and Sn dimer carries over into tin bulk, then one expects that a phase with a higher p population will be additionally (and erroneously) stabilized vs. a phase with a lower p population. This is exactly what is observed in alpha vs. beta Sn. Conversely, it must be possible to reverse this effect by stabilizing the s-like band. This can be achieved by applying a positive Hubbard correction or U value to s-like states. The effect of lowering the s band energy and of increasing the p-s gap was indeed confirmed in Sn atom and dimer calculations. For example, applying U(s) = 1.5 eV in SIESTA reduces the destabilization of the s band of a Sn atom vs. CCSD(T) (Table 2) from 3.3 eV to 2.8 eV while the destabilization of the p states remains at 3.1 eV; the s band destabilization in the dimer is reduced from 4.1 eV to 3.6 eV and the degree of underestimation of the p-s gap from 1.6 eV to 1.1 eV, while the p band destabilization remained at 2.5 eV.

With the increase of the U value, ∆Ecoh indeed decreased. When using a localized basis set in SIESTA (which was tuned to Ecoh of α Sn), the application of +U led to a modest weakening of Ecoh (within 0.1 eV/atoms for U values of up to +2.0 eV) and only a small change of the lattice constant (on the order of 0.01 Å), see Table 1. This can easily be compensated by tuning the PAO.EnergyShift parameter. For example, with a DZP basis obtained with PAO.EnergyShift=0.002 Ry and giving Ecoh(α)=3.13 eV/atom (with +U), a U value of +1.5 eV results in ∆Ecoh = 0.025 eV/atom. To confirm that the effect of +U is not an artefact of the choice of the atom-centered basis set, we performed a calculation with a TZP basis (using the same PAO.EnergyShift value) and obtained Ecoh(α)=3.15 eV/atom, ∆Ecoh = 0.018 eV/atom with U=+1.25 eV and Ecoh(α)=3.17 eV/atom, ∆Ecoh = 0.022 eV/atom with U=+1.0 eV. With U=0, ∆Ecoh was 0.039 eV/atom with the same TZP basis. The effect of a +U value applied to s states on the band structure can be seen from the PDOS (partial density of states) plot in Fig. 4, where we plot the density of s-like and p-like state. The PDOS are plotted up to the Fermi level, and E=0 refers to the average electrostatic potential. As expected, the +U value lowers the energy of the s band and affects little the p band.

Simultaneously, the p-s gap increases from 0.26 to 1.06 eV in α Sn and from 2.49 to 2.99 eV in β Sn. The effect on the Fermi level is minimal: within 0.05 eV for both phases when U is increased from 0 to 1.75 eV; the changes in the average electrostatic potential are negligible when applying a U value of this magnitude.

Together (i)-(iii) allow us to conclude that (i) DFT with the PBE functional over-stabilizes alpha over beta phase of tin by the mechanism of destabilizing s band more than the p band; (ii) this can be fixed by applying a positive U value to s-like states which permits obtaining accurate cohesive energies of both phases with the same computational setup. We have confirmed this result by performing calculations in VASP using a different type of basis set and of pseudopotential (i.e. plane waves and PAW, respectively). The results are also summarized in Table 1. Similarly to SIESTA calculations, the s population is higher in the beta phase by about 0.2 e/atom. The application of U=+1 eV on s levels does lead to the shift down in energy of the s–like band while inducing no significant shift in the p-like band (see Fig. A1 in the Appendix) and results in the change in ∆Ecoh from 0.039 eV/atom to 0.023 eV/atom. This simultaneously improves the cohesive energy of α Sn from 3.20 eV/atom to 3.16 eV/atom. That is, also in VASP we are able to choose a +U(s) value that results in correct cohesive energies of both α and β Sn. Similar values of +U(s) achieve ∆Ecoh of about 0.02 eV/atom in both VASP and SIESTA. That optimal values of +U a little different in VASP and SIESTA is not surprising given the somewhat differing definitions of s and p character with plane waves and with atom-centred bases and otherwise significant differences in the computational approaches and implementation. What is important is the common to these setups mechanism of destabilization of s levels vs p levels which leads to an overestimation of ∆Ecoh and which can be fixed by applying a +U value on s-like levels which allows reproducing accurate cohesive energies of both alpha and beta tin with one and the same computational scheme.

Conclusions In the ab initio modelling of tin based materials, specifically doped tin and alloys, it is necessary to be able to correctly model the energetics of the two low temperature and low pressure phases, namely, alpha and beta Sn, with the same computational setup. The small difference in the cohesive energies of these phases (about ∆Ecoh=0.02 eV/atom) and the resulting proximity of phase transition temperature to the room temperature make such modelling difficult. Specifically, the most practical and by far the most widely used approximation – DFT with the PBE functional – overestimates the difference in cohesive energies. We have shown that values of ∆Ecoh≈0.04 eV/atom are obtained with different types of basis sets and with different models of core electrons (all-electron or pseudopotentials of different types), which also leads to a significant overestimation of the α−β transition temperature. To identify the reason for this overestimation, we have analysed for the first time possible contributions from anharmonicity to the vibrational part of the free energy as well as errors in the electronic structure. We have shown that anharmonicity does not have a significant effect on Tαβ. By comparing DFT and CCSD(T) calculations on small model systems, we have shown that DFT with the PBE functional overestimates the energy of the s band to a larger extent than that of the p band. As s population is higher in beta Sn than in alpha Sn, this leads to overstabilization of α vs β Sn in DFT calculations. We have shown that it is possible to correct for this by applying a positive U value on s levels, whereby correct cohesive energies of both α and β Sn can be obtained with the same computational scheme.

The cohesive energies of α-Sn and β-Sn is therefore a highly practically relevant example of the need for developing of computationally efficient exchange correlation functionals that perform well for different phases of the same material with qualitatively different electronic structure (such as metalling and non-metallic phases).

Appendix Details of the effect of U(s) on the electronic structure of a Sn atom and a Sn dimer computed in VASP The effect of lowering the s band energy and of increasing the p-s gap was confirmed in Sn atom and dimer calculations in VASP. For example, applying U(s) = 1.5 eV reduces the destabilization of the s band of a Sn atom vs. CCSD(T) from 3.1 eV to 2.8 eV while the destabilization of the p states remains at 3.0 eV; the s band destabilization in the dimer is reduced from 4.0 eV to 3.7 eV and the degree of underestimation of the p-s gap from 1.6 eV to 1.2 eV, while the p band destabilization remained at 2.4 eV.

Details of band structure of α and β tin computed in VASP The VASP calculations assign populations for alpha/beta Sn of 1.84/2.04 for the s states (and thus 2.16/1.96 for the p states). Similarly to SIESTA calculations (and to what expected), the metallic beta Sn phase allocates more electrons to the s bands than the semiconducting alpha Sn phase does (by 0.2 e/atom). VASP calculations show that applying a Hubbard correction of magnitude +1.0 to s states improves notably the energy cohesive difference between the α and β phases. Analysis of the calculations shows that by applying U(s)=1.0, the population averaged energy for s states is decreased by 0.09 eV for alpha Sn (from -7.11 to -7.20 eV), and by 0.14 eV for beta Sn (from -6.61 to -6.75 eV), while that for p states is slightly increased: by 0.04 eV for alpha Sn (from -2.55 to -2.51 eV) and by 0.03 eV for beta Sn (from -2.54 to -2.51 eV).
