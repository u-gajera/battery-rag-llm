For instance, amorphous LiSi alloys, a-LixSi are attrac- tive anode materials for solid-state Li-ion batteries but suffer from mechanical instabilities due to significant volume variations when the Li content changes. A fundamental understanding of the mechanical behavior of such systems is necessary to address their poor mechanical integrity. Exper- imental characterization methods provide insufficient information to elaborate dynamic mechanical degradation mechanisms on the atomic scale, and first-principles methods that can describe atomic details, such as density functional theory (DFT), are computationally too demanding to access the system sizes necessary to model mechanical phenomena. Machine learning potentials (MLPs) can overcome the computational constraints of traditional DFT-based simulations and enable large- scale simulations with high accuracy and efficiency. Here, we provide a step-by-step tutorial on how to develop and apply MLPs to the investigation of mechanical properties in materials systems from bulk to nanoparticles in different compositions with Li-Si alloys as example. By training on a large and comprehensive data set (around 45,000 DFT structures) with the atomic energy network (ænet) package accelerated by PyTorch, a general and robust MLP is constructed that can reproduce results consistent with previous experimental observations. We demonstrate how to apply the MLP to realistic structures to visualize the defor- mation mechanism and determine the origin of mechanical instabilities caused by fracturing. By providing detailed insights into the different steps required to simulate the mechanical behaviour of Li–Si systems, this work aims to establish MLP-based simulations as a tool to understand the mechanical behavior in different materials systems at the atomic scale. ∗n.artrith@uu.nl 2", "page": 1, "position": 0}

INTRODUCTION The flammable liquid electrolyte in conventional lithium-ion batteries is a safety risk, and solid-state batteries that instead use solid Li-ion conductors can increase the safety while also enabling enhanced current densities and faster charging times [ref]. It has recently been demonstrated that nanostructured silicon can replace graphite as anode material in solid-state batteries to substantially increase the energy density [ref]. The most significant challenge for the commercialization of silicon anodes remain their low mechanical stability as the material undergoes large volume expansions and contractions during lithiation and delithiation [ref]. Moreover, recent studies emphasized the critical role of mechanics in solid-state batteries as the stress and strain resulting from battery cycling is a common failure mode [1] [ref]. Understanding dynamic failure mechanisms due to evolving mechanical quantities is cru- cial for the further development of solid-state batteries, but obtaining such insight from experimental characterization is extremely challenging. Instead, atomic-scale simulations allow monitoring the evolution of stress and strain and are often better suited to elucidate the reasons for poor mechanical integrity caused by mechanical deformations on the atomic scale. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with machine learning potentials (MLPs) provide a large-scale simulation approach with high accuracy and computational efficiency [refs]. MLPs trained on first principles density-functional theory (DFT) calculations can be es- sentially as accurate as the reference method while overcoming the intrinsic limitations in system sizes imposed by the great computational demand of DFT. However, obtaining a reliable and robust MLP that accurately describes the mechanical properties of a given materials system is a complex process and care has to be taken to avoid method-intrinsic issues such as overfitting and extrapolation. Here, we outline a step-by-step tutorial to guide through the construction and application of MLPs for the investigation of mechanical properties. 3", "page": 2, "position": 0}

MODEL AND METHODOLOGY In this study, both amorphous bulk and nanoparticle a-LixSi models were constructed to investigate the mechanical properties of the Li-Si system. The MLPs were trained with the open-source Atomic Energy Network (ænet) software package [2–4]. The training process can be greatly accelerated by fully utilizing the Graphics Processing Unit’s (GPU) comput- ing power. To achieve this, a GPU-supported extension of the ænet code was used as a substitute for the original training step [5]. All MD simulations were performed using the publicly available simulation code package Large-Scale Atomic/Molecular Massively Parallel Simulator (LAMMPS) [6, 7], with the OVITO (Open Visualization Tool) package used for visualization of the MD results [8]. A. Data set and MLP based on artificial neural networks For accurate and general MLPs, large, high-quality, and comprehensive training and test- ing data sets are required. This study’s data set was chosen from Artrith et al [9, 10], which covers around 45,000 bulk, surface, and cluster Li-Si structures at various compositions. An overview analysis of the data set is provided in Fig. 1, which shows the distribution of the Li/Si atom ratio and the number of Li/Si atoms in different structures. Feed-forward artificial neural networks (ANN) were chosen as the model architecture for the MLPs. Previous studies have shown that ANNs trained on this data set could provide a new approach for investigating the Li diffusivity in Si anodes, phase diagrams of a-LixSi, and the delithiation process of LiSi nanoparticles[9, 10]. The architecture of the feed-forward ANN in this work consisted of two hidden layers with 25 neurons each. The hyperbolic tangent function (Tanh) was chosen as the activation function. The local atomic environment and chemical species are represented by a descriptor constructed with the radial and angular distribution functions (RDF and ADF) whose coefficients are expanded by a basis set of Chebyshev polynomials [3] that have the following form: RDFi(r) = X Rj∈σRc i δ (r −Rij) fc (Rij) wtj, ADFi(θ) = X Rj,Rk∈σRc i δ (θ −θijk) fc (Rij) fc (Rik) wtjwtk, (1) 4", "page": 3, "position": 0}

The simulation box was stretched at a constant engineering strain rate in the y direction, with the x and z directions able to deform to account for the Poisson effect. For simulations of nanoparticles and nanoparticle-stacked models, all three compositions were used. All structures were divided into two parts of equal size, where one part was fixed and for the other one forces were applied in the direction in which they were stretched.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION A. Deformation mechanism and mechanical properties of a-Li13Si4 bulk structure As can be seen in Fig. 5b, the shear strain distribution in the final configuration (after a simulation time of 70 ps) of the bulk structure indicates that it deforms by forming a shear band. Corresponding to the large shear strain within the shear band, the region highlighted by a yellow ellipse in Fig. 5c shows a hole caused by fracturing in the stretching process. The cross-section along the xz plane is shown in Fig. 5d, where different colors represent 10", "page": 9, "position": 0}

Comparing the stretching with compression, the bulk structure also shows the deformation mechanism that shear bands are formed. The strain in some regions is greater than that in other regions in the end, which means they are the first area to be fractured. As for the stress-strain curve, it has the similar shape as that in tensile stretching situation. From the comparison of atoms with different colors, the sequence of positions of bond breakage could be estimated. The bonds around the middle position in the cross-section break first, forming a small internal hole inside the bulk structure. With the stretching process evolving, the crack tip gradually propagates to the edge surfaces of the bulk structure causing the hole to grow until finally penetrating through the bulk structure. The stress-strain curve of the bulk structure along with different shear strain distribu- tions at different strains is shown in Fig. 6. The a-Li13Si4 bulk structure shows a typical elastic-plastic curve yet without an obvious plastic yielding stage. It is worth noting that Young’s modulus of our bulk structure is calculated as 45.04 GPa, which is quite close to the experimental value of 45.7 GPa measured by nanoindentation tests in reference [16]. Recently, it was reported that amorphous shear bands found in crystalline materials act as drivers of plasticity [17]. Similarly, amorphous shear bands are also found in a-Li13Si4 bulk structures and the large plastic strain corresponds to the ductile behaviour. Moreover, to visualize the distribution of shear strains at different strains, the cross-sections perpendicular to the x-axis are shown, which makes it possible to clarify the evolution of strain distribution and thus elucidate the deformation mechanism. As shown in Fig. 6a, four regions with strains larger than the rest of the other areas in the cross-section are denoted as a, b, c, and d. With the bulk structure being further stretched, the shear strains in all regions tend to form shear bands and spread in directions at angles that are nearly parallel to each other (Fig. 6b). In Fig. 6c, it can be seen that regions a", "page": 10, "position": 0}

All curves show the typical elastic-plastic behaviours but with many noticeable differences which will be discussed in the following. For a-Li13Si4 nanoparticle, the curve shows a short yet obvious plastic yielding stage around the area denoted a, followed by an obvious strain hardening stage before the area denoted b. However, for both a-LiSi, and a-LiSi3 nanoparticles, no plastic yielding stages are found. When it comes to the mechanics parameters, the ultimate tensile strength of a-LiSi3 nanoparticle is the highest, larger than that of a-Li13Si4 nanoparticle, with a-LiSi being the least. For the stiffness, however, a-Li13Si4 12", "page": 11, "position": 0}

It is worth noting that a-Li13Si4 nanoparticle has the best ductility and toughness as well. Relating different points in the stress-strain curves to their actual mechanical defor- mations provides an intuitive understanding of their behaviours subjected to the tension process. In Fig. 8, the distribution of shear strains and morphology of corresponding cross- sections are shown. Fig. 8a and Fig. 8d correspond to the curve between a and b in Fig. 7. During a and b, the nanoparticle shows the formation of shear bands, which is the reason why the plastic strain is generated. Fig. 8b and Fig. 8c are the states around f and d in Fig. 7, which not only shows the formation of shear bands but also shows the necking behaviours that are quite typical in materials.

In both stacking situations, stacked a-Li13Si4 nanoparticles have the maximum stiffness and highest tensile strength. It is worth noting that for stacking 50 nanoparticles, the stiffness and ultimate tensile strength of a-LiSi are larger than those in a-LiSi3, whereas for stacking 80 nanoparticles the situation is completely opposite. Together, this means the mechanical properties are influenced by both the staking numbers and the Li-Si composition. To relate the deformation mechanism to the stress-strain curve, the morphology of the deformations in a-Li13Si4 and a-LiSi3 structures is shown in Fig. 11. Since a-Li13Si4 and a-LiSi structures deform in a similar way and the stress-strain curve of a-LiSi3 structure is different than the others, a-Li13Si4 and a-LiSi3 structures are chosen to compare the morphology. 15", "page": 14, "position": 0}

Stress-strain curve of stacked nanoparticles with different stacking numbers and different Li-Si compositions. a, Stacking 50 nanoparticles. b, Stacking 80 nanoparticles. First, as seen in Fig. 11a and Fig. 11e, the curved shear band could be clearly visualized which indicates that the cracking surface is not flat but curved. The same phenomenon is also found in Fig. 11b and Fig. 11f for the a-LiSi3 structure. The biggest difference between Fig. 11a, Fig. 11e and Fig. 11b, Fig. 11f is the size of the shear band and thus the content of penetration. The shear band in a-Li13Si4 structure is larger and penetrates through the whole cross-section, whereas in a-LiSi3 structure the cross-section is not fully penetrated by the shear band. This could explain why the stress-strain curve of a-LiSi3 structure does not show the pattern of dropping as the other two structures in stage II in Fig. 10a. The bonds around the centered atoms in the cross-section break more slowly than the rest of the systems. Then, for stacking 80 particles, even though the shear bands appear to be flatter in Fig. 11c and Fig. 11d than in Fig. 11g and Fig. 11h, there are still some regions with curved shapes. Notably speaking, for a-LiSi3 structure, the shear band penetrates through the cross-section quickly so that the dropping would show up in 16", "page": 15, "position": 0}

In the form of nanoparticles, the stiffness of a-Li13Si4 is largest, followed by a-LiSi3 and a-LiSi in the order of values. Whereas for the ultimate tensile strength, the order would be as a-LiSi3, a-Li13Si4, and a-LiSi. The stacking numbers of nanoparticles together with Li-Si compositions affect the mechanical properties of the Li-Si system since the order of stiffness and ultimate tensile strength would change for different structures. (3) The deformation mechanisms in bulk and nanoparticle structures are visualized and elucidated on the atomic scale. The plastic behaviours stem from the formation of shear bands whose evolution is elaborated for the bulk structure. The fracturing pattern of the Li-Si system is clarified. The origin of the fracturing is in the middle part of every structure due to the bond breaking. The propagation of the fracturing is from inside to the outside until the cross-section is fully penetrated. This work shows that MD simulations with MLPs can be used as tools to investigate the deformation mechanism and the origin of mechanical instabilities caused by fracturing on an atomic level. The first principle-based MLPs are sufficiently accurate and efficient to a) model the large structure necessary to describe the deformation process and b) describe the breaking of bonds occurring in the course of the process. By providing detailed insights into the different steps required to simulate the mechanical behaviour of Li–Si systems, this work aims to establish MLP-based simulations as a tool to understand the mechanical behavior in different materials systems at the atomic scale.
