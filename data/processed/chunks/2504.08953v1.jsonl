Our findings reveal that Li and Na intercalation primarily modifies the electronic properties of Nb2C without inducing significant structural distortions, as indicated by Raman intensity variations. Adsorption energy calculations show that the T4 and H3 sites are the most favorable for metal intercalation, with Nb2CO2 exhibiting stronger adsorption due to oxygen functionalization. We find that Nb2C offers lower diffusion barriers, especially for Na ions, making it a promising candidate for fast-charging SIBs. In contrast, Nb2CO2 enhances charge retention through stronger electrostatic interactions but introduces higher migration resistance. Electronic structure analysis confirms the metallic nature of both MXenes, ensuring efficient electron transport. Open-circuit voltage (OCV) calculations indicate that Nb2CO2 exhibits higher OCV values than Nb2C, highlighting the role of surface functionalization in tuning electrochemical performance. Our study suggests that, while Li-based systems achieve slightly higher theoretical capacities, Na- based systems exhibit comparable performance, reinforcing the viability of sodium-ion batteries as a cost-effective alternative. Overall, our results demonstrate that Nb2C is better suited for rapid ion transport, whereas Nb2CO2 offers enhanced charge retention. These insights provide a foundation for the optimization of MXene-based electrodes for next-generation high performance energy storage applications.

However, despite their advantages, the increasing demand for LIBs has raised concerns regarding lithium’s limited global supply, uneven distribution, and rising extraction costs4. These challenges have driven the search for alternative battery technologies that can offer comparable performance at a lower cost. Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) have emerged as a promising alternative due to their natural abundance and relative lower cost than lithium5,6. While in general, SIBs can be 10–20% more cost-effective than LIBs6, their cost advantage can reach up to 25% on some occasions7. Although Na has a larger ionic radius, leading to differences in electrochemical behavior, recent advancements in electrode materials have demonstrated that SIBs can achieve competitive and sometimes superior performance in terms of energy density8, cycle life9,10, low temperature operation11, thermal stability12, and safety13. Central to these improvements is the development of efficient anode materials that offer superior reaction kinetics14, high conductivity15, structural stability16, and low ion diffusion barriers17, which are key to unlocking the full potential of SIBs as a cost-effective and sustainable energy storage solution18. Previous studies have shown that SIBs require greater structural and lattice stability in electrode materials, making many materials that excel in lithium storage unsuitable for sodium storage applications19. For example, in commercial lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), graphite is widely used as an anode material, but it fails to accommodate sodium ions effectively due to the insufficient interlayer spacing of graphite (∼0.334 nm) to accommodate the larger Na+ ions, making it unsuitable for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs)20. In addition, limited active sites of hard carbon for Na+ ions contributes to reduced capacity and rate performance21. Moreover, many anode materials suffer from poor cycling stability22, low specific capacity23, and low initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE)24, which hinder the practical implementation of SIBs19. As a result, significant efforts and attention have been directed toward identifying stable anode materials with desirable electrochemical properties, as", "page": 1, "position": 0}

As a result, significant efforts and attention have been directed toward identifying stable anode materials with desirable electrochemical properties, as they play a crucial role in advancing the next generation of renewable energy technologies. In this aspect, MXenes (M=transition metal, X=Carbide/nitride layers), a novel category of two-dimensional transition metal compounds, typically derived from MAX (M=transition metal, A=A-group element, X= carbon/nitrogen) phases through selective chemical etching of the A-layer, have emerged as promising anode materials for energy storage devices25. Their structural design, excellent electrical conductivity, expansive surface area, hydrophilicity26, and adaptable surface chemistry make them well-suited for energy storage applications27. MXenes are typically represented as Mn+1XnTx, where Tx represents surface functional groups (-OH, -O, -F) introduced during the etching process28. Since, the discovery of this outstanding material, significant studies have been conducted on different Mxenes such as Ti2C, Ti3C2, Mo2C, Nb2C, and V2C to explore their efficacy as potential anode materials for energy storage29–33. Among various MXenes, niobium-based Nb2C and its oxygen-functionalized derivative, Nb2CO2 34, have garnered significant attention as promising electrode material in energy storage devices due to their metallic conductivity, excellent mechanical stability, and high theoretical capacities32. The presence of surface terminations, such as oxygen (-O), plays a critical role in modulating the adsorption, diffusion, and electrochemical performance of intercalating ions, influencing the overall battery performance. Despite these advantages, a comprehensive comparative study on the structural, electronic, and electrochemical properties of Nb2C and Nb2CO2 as anode materials for LIBs and SIBs is still lacking. A systematic theoretical investigation can provide valuable insights into their electrochemical behavior, guiding experimental efforts to optimize their performance for next-generation energy storage applications.

By evaluating the trade-offs between adsorption strength, ion mobility, and charge retention, this study provides valuable insights into the potential of Nb2C and Nb2CO2 as anode materials for next-generation high performing LIBs and SIBs. The results not only highlight the advantages of sodium-ion batteries as a cost-effective alternative to lithium-based systems but also underscore the importance of surface functionalization in optimizing electrochemical performance. Our findings serve as a foundation for future research aimed at enhancing MXene-based anode materials through surface engineering and structural modifications to achieve high-efficiency energy storage. 2 Computational Method Ab initio density functional theory (DFT) calculations in this study were performed using the Vienna Ab-initio Simulation Package (VASP)35. The projector augmented wave (PAW) method was employed with a 500 eV energy cutoff to describe the electron properties of the system36. We constructed a 3 × 3 supercell with a 15 Å vacuum layer for each structural model to eliminate interactions between periodic images. The Monkhorst pack scheme37 with 3 × 3 × 1 mesh points in k-space were used for all the systems considered in the present study. We used the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) functional within the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) to optimize the geometric structures for the exchange-correlation potential38. Geometrical relaxations were performed until the forces on the atoms are below 0.02 eV/Å and the total energy difference was less than 1 × 10−6 eV/atom.

We have considered two possible configurations (Fig. S1) for placing O atoms, one on top of C (Configuration I) and one on top of Nb (Configuration II). The energy comparison (Table S2) between the two examined configurations of oxygen indicates that it preferentially adopts the second arrangement, which has the lowest energy and is identified as the most stable state. The obtained cell parameter of Nb2CO2 is 3.15 Å with a Nb-O bond length of 2.12 Å. The calculated bonding distance between Nb-C in Nb2CO2 is 2.22 Å.

Previous studies have reported the phonon spectra of both Nb2C and Nb2CO2, confirming their dynamic stability through the observation of non-negative frequencies45. For pristine Nb2C, the three constituent atoms give rise to six optical modes and three acoustic modes. In contrast, for Nb2CO2, the primitive cell contains five atoms, resulting in twelve optical modes and three acoustic modes. Among them, Eg and A1g modes are found to be Raman active46.

To examine structural transformations, we computationally simulated the Raman spectra of Nb2C with and without Li/Na intercalation, as well as Nb2CO2. The results of these simulations are shown in Fig. 3. In case of Nb2C, The peak at 208 cm−1 is attributed to the E1g symmetry mode, representing an in-plane shear vibration involving Nb and C atoms experimentally obtained at 206 cm−1 47. The Raman peak observed at 266.12 cm−1 corresponds closely to the experimentally obtained A1g mode at 268 cm−1 48, which arises from the out-of-plane vibrations of Nb and C atoms. We obtained another intense peak at 567.01 cm−1 in the Nb2C structure which is present in both Li and Na intercalated Nb2C structure. The presence of various terminations and structural imperfections in the MXene lattice makes analyzing the Raman spectra complex49. Although experimental validation is lacking for the obtained 567.01 cm−1, our theoretical prediction of this peak may assist future investigations on the structure. For Nb2CO2, a Raman peak was observed at 599.84 cm−1, corresponding to the out-of-plane oxygen vibration (A1g mode). This value is in between the previously reported44 theoretical prediction of 546 cm−1 and the experimental measurement of 681 cm−1. Another detected peak at 143.05 cm−1 is attributed to the Eg mode of Nb2CO2, which was previously calculated at 132 cm−1 48. Additionally, the peak at 174.47 cm−1 in the Nb2CLi and Nb2CNa is associated with the Eg mode of Nb2C, showing a slight deviation from the previously calculated value48 of 166.11 cm−1. Interestingly, after Li/Na intercalation, the Raman peak positions remain unchanged, while their intensities show variation, as shown in Fig. 4.

The absence of peak shifts suggests that Li/Na intercalation does not significantly alter the structural framework or bonding forces within Nb2C. In contrast, the intensity of Raman peaks is influenced by the polarizability of the material, which determines how the electron cloud around atoms responds to incident light50. Li/Na atoms, being highly electropositive, donate electrons to the Nb2C substrate upon intercalation. This charge transfer modifies the local electronic environment, affecting the material’s polarizability and consequently altering the Raman scattering cross-section. Additionally, intercalation can modify electron-phonon interactions, influencing how efficiently phonons couple to the incident light. Variations in intensity can also arise due to changes in the local dielectric environment, which can either enhance or suppress Raman signals. Thus, the observed changes in Raman intensity without peak shifts indicate that Li/Na intercalation primarily affects the electronic properties of Nb2C rather than its structural integrity.

The most exposed atomic layer was used as a reference in both cases. The Top site corresponds to a Li atom positioned directly above an atom in the outermost layer. The T4 site places the Li atom above the second-most exposed layer, while the H3 site is aligned with the third-most exposed layer (cf. Fig. 1). We calculated the adsorption energy by using the following equation: Ead = ENb2C(O2)M −ENb2C(O2) −xµM x (1) where Ead is the adsorption energy, ENb2C(O2)M is the total energy of the system with metal ions, ENb2C(O2) is the energy of the system without metals, µM represents the energy of the isolated metal, and x is the total number of inserted adatoms. Note that Nb2C(O2) represents either Nb2C or Nb2CO2 when appropriate. Table 2 represents the calculated Ead values of all the systems investigated in the present study. Negative values of the adsorbed energy in all the systems suggest favorable adsorption of both Li and Na onto Nb2C and Nb2CO2 Mxenes.

A similar trend was observed for Na intercalation, with adsorption energies of -2.45 eV and -3.43 eV. Fig. 5 provides a comparative analysis of the adsorption energies.

Notably, the energy difference between the H3 and T4 sites for Na is minimal, approximately 0.01 eV, suggesting that the H3 site in the Na-intercalated Nb2C system is also a viable adsorption site. However, in this study, we selected the T4 site for Na adsorption in the Nb2C system for all calculations, as it exhibited slightly lower energy than H3. Across all studied systems, Nb2CO2 demonstrated significantly lower adsorption energy compared to pristine Nb2C, indicating enhanced stability due to the presence of O functional groups. Efficient charge and discharge rates in rechargeable batteries rely on ion migration and electron transport kinetics. Lower diffusion barriers for Li-ion and Na-ion play a key role in enabling high-performance fast-charging and discharging. We employed the CI-NEB approach to gain insights on the Li-ion and Na-ion migration pathways and energy barriers in Nb2C and Nb2CO2 monolayers. As observed in Table 2, the T4 site is identified as a favorable adsorption site for Nb2C, while the H3 site is preferred for Nb2CO2 during both Na and Li intercalation. Accordingly, in the CI-NEB simulations, the initial adsorption sites for Na and Li intercalation were set to T4 for Nb2C and H3 for Nb2CO2 to ensure accurate diffusion pathway analysis. We determined three potential diffusion pathways between the two nearest adsorption sites on the Nb2C and Nb2CO2 surface. Fig. 6 shows the diffusion pathways on an atomistic model of Nb2C. Li/Na migration in Nb2C and Nb2CO2 follows distinct diffusion pathways influenced by the adsorption sites and atomic interactions within the monolayer. As Li/Na moves along Path 1 (straight pathway), migration occurs directly from the initial to the final adsorption site.

On the Nb2CO2 surface, Na-ion diffusion barriers are 117.07 meV for Path 1, 420.29 meV for Path 2, and 117.20 meV for Path 3. Meanwhile, Li-ion diffusion on Nb2CO2 shows the highest energy barriers, with values of 241.37 meV for Path 1, 441.64 meV for Path 2, and 240.92 meV for Path 3. Across all cases, Path 2 (upper pathway) consistently exhibits the highest energy barrier, particularly for Nb2CO2, where the presence of functional groups significantly restricts ion mobility. Additionally, for Path 1 and Path 3 of Nb2C surface and path 3 of Nb2CO2 surface two peaks of nearly equal barrier values are observed, with a local minimum in between, corresponding to a metastable adsorption site for Li/Na atoms. This intermediate position allows temporary stabilization before continuing migration, influencing the overall diffusion process. Given these findings, Nb2C and Nb2CO2 surfaces provide a more efficient migration pathway for Na-ions compared to Li-ions, making them highly suitable for Na-ion battery applications due to their lower diffusion resistance and smoother ion transport. 3.4 Electronic Properties 3.4.1 Charge Transfer We plotted the charge difference density to further understand the charge transfer of these systems. Charge differences were calculated using the following equation: ∆ρ = ρNb2C(O2)M −ρNb2C(O2) −ρM (2) In the equation, ρNb2C(O2)M is the charge density of Nb2CM or Nb2CO2M with M representing either Na or Li, ρNb2C(O2) is the charge density of Nb2C or Nb2CO2, and ρM is the charge density of Na or Li.

The CDD visualization (Fig. 8) reveals charge accumulation and depletion patterns across the Nb2C and Nb2CO2 surfaces. On both Nb2C and Nb2CO2 , a pronounced yellow region is observed around the Nb and O atom, indicating charge accumulation for both Li and Na adsorption. In contrast, the intercalated Li and Na atoms mostly exhibits blue regions, reflecting the charge depletion. The strong charge transfer observed at the interface aligns with Bader charge results, confirming the nearly complete ionization of Li and Na and their strong chemical adsorption onto the Nb2CO2 substrate.

On the Nb2C surface, Li transfers 0.78 e, indicating stronger electron donation compared to Na, which transfers only 0.37 e.

This improvement suggests that O-groups create stronger electrostatic interactions with the adsorbed ions, thereby increasing adsorption stability. The ability of Nb2CO2 to facilitate higher charge transfer makes it a more effective platform for ion retention, which could enhance battery performance by improving charge separation and reducing energy losses. This behavior is particularly important for Na-ion batteries, where efficient charge storage is crucial for long-term cycling stability. Nb2CO2 provides stronger adsorption sites for Li and Na due to the higher charge transfer observed in Bader analysis. This stronger interaction is primarily due to the electronegative oxygen functional groups, which create more localized charge accumulation around the adsorbed ions. As a result, Li and Na ions experience greater electrostatic attraction, leading to higher stability on Nb2CO2 compared to Nb2C. However, this enhanced adsorption also contributes to higher 8", "page": 7, "position": 1}

Since the ions are more strongly bound to Nb2CO2, they require more energy to overcome the adsorption potential and migrate across the surface. This is reflected in the higher energy barriers for both Li and Na on Nb2CO2, particularly in Path 2 (upper pathway), where the interaction with the surface is most pronounced. In contrast, the weaker adsorption of Na on Nb2C results in lower charge transfer but also lower diffusion barriers, allowing for easier ion migration. These findings highlight a critical trade-off in anode material optimization: while strong adsorption enhances charge retention and stability, it can also hinder ion mobility, which is crucial for fast charge and discharge rates in high- performance batteries. The lower diffusion barriers of Na suggest that sodium-ion batteries could achieve more efficient ion transport compared to Li-ion batteries, making them a viable alternative for energy storage applications. However, the significantly higher barriers in Nb2CO2, despite improved charge transfer, indicate the need to balance adsorption 9", "page": 8, "position": 0}

The electronic band structure analysis confirms the material’s metallic nature, as multiple energy bands intersect the Fermi level (E = 0 eV), ensuring partially filled states for electron transport. PDOS analysis further shows that Nb(d) orbitals primarily drive the metallic properties, with a prominent peak near the Fermi level indicating a high carrier density. This high carrier concentration enhances charge conduction, reinforcing the strong metallic character of all the studied systems in the present study. Previous studies have linked such features to desirable performance characteristics in ion batteries, increasing the conductivity due to enhanced charge transfer between Mxene and the metal atoms52. 3.4.3 Open Circuit Voltage We additionally calculated the open circuit voltage to assess the efficacy of the anode material using the following equation: Nb2C(O2) + xM →Nb2C(O2)Mx (3) ∆Gf = Ef + P∆Vf −T∆Sf (4) OCV = −∆Gf x ≈− ENb2C(O2)Mx −ENb2C(O2) −xEM x (5) At room temperature, the P∆V term (related to pressure-volume work) is typically very small for solid-state systems, and the T∆S term (entropy contribution) does not significantly affect the voltage. These effects contribute less than 0.01 V ( 25 mev) to the overall open-circuit voltage (OCV), making ∆G approximately equal to ∆E in practical calculations for battery and electrode materials53. We considered single-sided adsorption to compare the effects of Li and Na metals on the OCV in the Nb2C and Nb2CO2 systems. The OCVs of Li on Nb2C(O2) and Na on Nb2C(O2) show a decreasing trend with an increasing number of adatoms, as illustrated in Fig. 11. However, they exhibit different slopes, which could be attributed to variations in adsorption energetics, charge transfer mechanisms, and the interaction strength between the adatoms and the substrate. These factors influence how the OCV changes with increasing coverage, leading to distinct slope behaviors. The highest OCV was obtained for Li adsorption on Nb2CO2 at 3.70 eV, followed by 3.43 eV for Na adsorption on Nb2CO2.

Additionally, the presence of oxygen functional groups on Nb2C significantly increased the OCV, emphasizing the role of surface chemistry in enhancing electrochemical performance.

However, the difference in capacity between Li and Na adsorption is relatively small, suggesting that Na could be a viable alternative to Li for energy storage applications. For Nb2C-based systems, the highest theoretical capacity was obtained for Nb2CLi, with values of 130.89 mAh/g for single-sided adsorption and 261.78 mAh/g for double-sided adsorption. These results are closely aligned with previous studies on Li ion batteries, confirming the consistency of our calculations with established theoretical predictions51. In contrast, Nb2CNa showed slightly lower capacities of 121.37 mAh/g (single-sided) and 242.74 mAh/g (double-sided), indicating that Na adsorption results in a minor capacity reduction. When oxygen functionalization is introduced in Nb2CO2-based systems, a notable decrease in capacity is observed. Nb2CO2Li exhibits 113.20 mAh/g (single-sided) and 226.40 mAh/g (double-sided), whereas Nb2CO2Na has the lowest capacities among all tested systems, with 106.01 mAh/g for single-sided adsorption. This trend suggests that the presence of oxygen functional groups influences charge storage by altering the adsorption environment, potentially affecting charge transfer and ion diffusion. Previous studies on different MXenes have also reported a similar reduction trend when an oxygen functional group is added to the metal carbide54. Oxygen functionalization in Nb2CO2 reduces interlayer spacing, increasing the diffusion barrier and restricting ion mobility leading to higher energy requirements for ion migration, ultimately lowering charge storage capacity compared to Nb2C. Conclusions In this study, we conducted an ab initio investigation of Nb2C and Nb2CO2 MXenes as potential anode materials for sodium- and lithium-ion batteries, focusing on their structural, electronic, and electrochemical properties. Our Raman analysis indicates that Li/Na intercalation predominantly alters the electronic environment rather than inducing significant structural distortions, as evidenced by intensity variations without notable peak shifts. Adsorption energy calculations confirm that the T4 and H3 sites are the most favorable for metal intercalation onto Nb2C and Nb2CO2 respectively. Nb2CO2 exhibits stronger adsorption due to the presence of O2 functional groups irrespective of Li/Na intercalation.

Nb2CO2 exhibits stronger adsorption due to the presence of O2 functional groups irrespective of Li/Na intercalation. The diffusion barrier analysis reveals a trade-off between adsorption stability and ion mobility. Nb2CO2 provides stronger adsorption sites for Li and Na, which enhances charge retention but also increases migration resistance, particularly along the upper-layer pathway (Path 2). In contrast, Nb2C exhibits lower diffusion barriers, especially for Na ions, making it a more favorable candidate for fast ion transport. This suggests that Na-ion batteries could achieve higher efficiency and faster charge/discharge rates compared to their Li-ion counterparts. Bader charge analysis highlights that oxygen functionalization significantly enhances charge transfer, stabilizing intercalated ions and reinforcing electrostatic interactions. However, this increased charge localization also leads to higher energy barriers for ion migration. Electronic structure calculations confirm the metallic nature of Nb2C and Nb2CO2, with Nb(d) orbitals contributing dominantly to the conduction band, ensuring efficient electron transport necessary for battery applications. Open circuit voltage (OCV) calculations further demonstrate that Nb2CO2 enhances electrochemical performance due to its higher OCV values, emphasizing the role of surface chemistry in modulating energy storage characteristics. Theoretical capacity calculations show that while Li-based systems generally exhibit higher capacities due to Li’s lower atomic weight, Na-based systems provide comparable performance, reinforcing their potential as a viable alternative. The presence of oxygen functional groups in Nb2CO2 reduces capacity due to increased diffusion resistance, highlighting the need for structural modifications to balance adsorption strength with ion transport kinetics. Overall, our findings suggest that Nb2C and Nb2CO2 MXenes hold strong potential as anode materials for sodium- and lithium-ion batteries, with Nb2C being more suitable for applications requiring faster ion transport and Nb2CO2 offering enhanced charge retention. Given the lower cost and abundance of Na, sodium-ion batteries based on these MXenes present a promising alternative to conventional lithium-ion batteries.
