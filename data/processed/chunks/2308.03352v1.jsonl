Zinc-ion batteries (ZIBs) rely on a lithium-ion-like Zn2+-shuttle, which enables higher roundtrip efficiencies and better cycle life than zinc-air batteries. Manganese-oxide cathodes in near-neutral zinc sulfate electrolytes are the most prominent candidates for ZIBs. Zn2+-insertion, H+-insertion, and Mn2+- dissolution are proposed to contribute to the charge-storage mechanism. During discharge and charge, two distinct phases are observed. Notably, the pH-driven precipitation of zinc-sulfate-hydroxide is detected during the second discharge phase. However, a complete and consistent understanding of the two-phase mechanism of these ZIBs is still missing. This paper presents a continuum full cell model supported by DFT calculations to investigate the implications of these observations. We integrate the complex-formation reactions of near-neutral aqueous electrolytes into the battery model and, in combination with the DFT calculations, draw a consistent picture of the cycling mechanism. We investigate the interplay between electrolyte pH and reaction mechanisms at the manganese-oxide cathodes and identify the dominant charge-storage mechanism. Our model is validated with electrochemical cycling data, cyclic voltammograms, and in-situ pH measurments. This allows us to analyse the influence of cell design and electrolyte composition on cycling and optimize the battery performance. I. INTRODUCTION Zinc-metal anodes feature competitive energy densities and are sufficiently stable in aqueous electrolytes, which are en- vironmentally friendly, cheap and have excellent ionic con- ductivity. Several primary zinc batteries based on alkaline electrolytes, such as zinc-carbon, zinc-air, or alkaline MnO2 batteries are commercially used for a long time1.

However, these alkaline zinc batteries were never successfully commer- cialized as secondary batteries as they experience very limited rechargeability2,3. Modern rechargeable zinc-ion batteries use similar materi- als and electrodes as Zn-MnO2 batteries but with non-alkaline electrolytes4. In 1986, Yamamoto and coworkers presented a battery with a metallic zinc anode and MnO2 cathode5,6. In exchange for the KOH electrolyte, they used a near-neutral aqueous solution of ZnSO4 as electrolyte. This early ex- periment showed a rechargeability, significantly better than their alkaline predecessors, but still limited to around 30 cycles5. Different inorganic zinc salts were tested as aque- ous electrolytes6, of which ZnSO4, which is still the most popular7, showed the highest achievable capacity. At the be- ginning of the 21st century, improvements in cycling stabil- ity re-sparked interest in ZIBs, leading to a rapidly grow- ing amount of research in the last decade. Several other cathode materials were tested1, vanadates achieving high stabilities8,9, Prussian blue analogs with extraordinary cy- cling stability10, and organic cathode materials with promising capacities11,12. Nevertheless, manganese-based cathodes are still the most promising combining a well-established produc- tion chain with a competitive overall cell performance. There ∗birger.horstmann@dlr.de are several approaches to increase the cell voltage which typ- ically requires extending the electrolyte stability by using non-aqueous electrolytes13,14. However, aqueous electrolytes achieve higher energy densities and offer a price advantage and excellent eco-friendliness. In the last decade, research achieved a significant increase in cycling stability and investigated the details of cycling char- acteristics. It was observed that both discharging as well as charging voltages show two distinct phases15–18. While the discharge and charge phases at high state of charge (SOC) experience a rather fast kinetic, the second phase at the end of discharge and the beginning of charge only shows slow kinetics15,19,20.

A dip in cell potential is present between the two discharge phases. It is most pronounced in micro- structured MnO2 cathodes. This voltage dip during dis- charge correlates with the onset of Zn4(OH)6SO4 (ZHS) pre- cipitation. Precipitation of ZHS occurs at the MnO2 cath- ode during the second phase of the discharge and is dis- solved again at the beginning of charge as demonstrated by in-situ spectroscopy18,21. Additionally, different polymorphs of MnO2 are considered and studied as electrodes, but δ- MnO2 with its layered structure is often regarded as the most promising22–24. Furthermore, the cell is optimized by vary- ing electrolyte concentration and composition7,25. Especially, pre-adding a Mn2+-salt to optimize cycling performance is evaluated26–28. The precipitation of ZHS indicates a reaction process that changes electrolyte pH. ZHS precipitates at a pH ≈5.5, which is more alkaline than benign ZnSO4 electrolytes29. The coin- sertion of H+ is often attributed to the observed pH shift. Lately, research papers focused on the dissolution process of Mn2+-ion leaching from the cathode26,30,31. Both, the inser- tion of H+ as well as the dissolution of Mn2+ result in an increase in electrolyte pH29,32.

The importance of cathodic dissolution for understanding the cycling mechanism of MnO2-based ZIBs is further high- lighted by the recently published works of Chen et al.18, God- effroy et al.16, and Yang et al.17. In this paper, we present a theory-based approach and iden- tify the cycling mechanism of ZIBs (see Figure 1). We fo- cus on the behavior of ZIBs with MnO2 cathode in an aque- ous ZnSO4 solution. With the help of density functional the- ory (DFT) calculations, we investigate the properties of δ- MnO2 and evaluate the dissolution and insertion potentials of the experimentally proposed processes4. Additionally, we use thermodynamic calculations of the equilibrium speciation of the ZnSO4 electrolyte to identify electrolyte stability with re- spect to precipitation and to quantify the pH buffering proper- ties. Based on this result, we develop our ZIB model describ- ing the dynamic cell behavior. We implement a pseudo-two- dimensional (P2D) cell model which uses the quasi-particle transport theory derived by Clark et al.33–35. We both inves- tigate the zinc- and proton-insertion mechanism as well as Mn2+-dissolution (Figure 1) and compare them with evidence from electrochemical cycling measurements. With this model, we elucidate the cycling mechanism of ZIB cells and use it for cell optimizations. II. THEORY A.

We approximate the overall difference in the Gibbs free energy ∆G as ∆G ≈∆E −T∆S conf , (1) where S conf is the configurational entropy of the structure and ∆E the difference in the total energies calculated by DFT. Ex- tending the computational hydrogen electrode to the compu- tational zinc electrode36,37, we derive convenient expressions for the electrochemical potentials ˜µi = µi + zieU for Zn2+ and H+ thus avoiding explicit calculations of solvation en- ergies. This approach uses the circumstance, that the equi- libria at standard conditions can be used to express the elec- trochemical potentials of solvated ions through molecular or atomic chemical potentials36.

Continuum Cell Model Equilibrium Speciation & Quasi-Particle Transport model When simulating the transport of near-neutral aqueous elec- trolytes, we must follow the dynamics of multiple species formed by zinc and its ligands. Not only is this compu- tationally costly by increasing the problem dimensionality, but it also decreases numerical stability due to the different timescales and the non-linearity of complex-forming reaction kinetics. Our approach builds upon the quasi-particle trans- port model developed and applied in previous works on near- neutral zinc-air batteries33–35. The presented quasi-particle framework utilizes an abstrac- tion level to resolve the dynamic behavior in aqueous elec- trolytes. We define quasi-particles so that their concentrations are invariant under the complex-formation reactions. This al- lows us to decouple slow electrolyte transport and slow het- erogeneous reactions from fast complex formation reactions. We calculate the transport of Zn2+-quasi-particles instead of each Zn-ligand complex individually. On the side, we solve for electrolyte equilibrium speciation with algebraic equations defining the respective quasi-particles. In this work, we use the quasi-particles Zn2+ T , H+ T, Mn2+ T and SO42− T . The index T denotes total concentration. For example, Zn2+ T is the total concentration of Zn atoms, defined as [Zn2+ T ] =[Zn2+] + 4 X n=1 [Zn(SO4)n 2·(1−n)] + 4 X n=1 [Zn(OH)n 2−n] +2 · \u0010 [Zn2OH3+] + [Zn2(OH)6 2−] \u0011 +4 · [Zn4(OH)4 4+] . (5) Here, n is the stoichiometry of the zinc-sulfate complex, square brackets are used to indicate a concentration ([X] = cX). Consequently, electrolyte pH is given by the H+- concentration as pH = −log10 cH+/c0. We equate concen- trations and activities as we analyzed that measured activity coefficients do not significantly alter our results. All details of the quasi-particle Ansatz can be found in Ref. 34.

Electrolyte Speciation (Thermodynamics) Calculating the equilibrium speciation in the ZnSO4 elec- trolyte gives us an overview of the dynamics of electrolyte pH and precipitation products. The law of mass action presented in Subsection II B determines the speciation in the aqueous electrolyte. Figure 3 shows the dominant zinc-ligand complex as a function of pH and total zinc concentration for the fixed manganese and sulfate concentrations [SO42− T ] = 2.5 m and [Mn2+ T ] = 0.5 m. We demonstrate the distribution concentra- tions of all Zn2+-complexes in the Supporting Information in Figure S1. The solid gray lines are paths of constant [SO42− T ]- concentration, which is invariant under the electrochemical re- actions. Precipitation of ZHS, ZnO, Zn(OH)2, and Mn(OH)2 occurs in the region above the colored lines. If a ZIB battery is discharged slowly, the electrolyte will stay homogeneous throughout the cell. The initial pH of our electrolyte is ≈4.3, the total zinc concentration is [ZnT] = 2 m, indicated by the white dot in Figure 3. During discharge, elec- trolyte pH is expected to rise due to H+ insertion (see Equa- tion (13)) and Zn0.5MnO2 dissolution (see Equation (16)). Thus, the electrolyte state during discharge follows the solid gray lines in Figure 3 towards higher pH. When the electrolyte state hits the orange line, ZHS precipitation starts.

The precip- itation of ZHS reduces the amounts of [SO42− T ] and [OH−] (see Equation (19)) buffering the pH. To conclude, the relevant pH region for the studied ZIB is below 6 and the dominant species during operation is in all cases a neutral Zn2+-SO42– complex. We conclude that the precipitation of ZHS is thermodynamically favorable. The precipitation of zinc or manganese (hydro)oxides is not ex- pected. The solubility limit of ZHS is reached at a pH of 5.2 to 6.3 depending on the Zn2+-concentration. The maximal pH change before the onset of ZHS precip- itation must correlate with the capacity for H+ insertion (see Equation (13)) and MnO2 dissolution (see Equation (16)). As H+ insertion is often assumed to occur at the beginning of dis- charge and we calculate a large OCV in Subsection III A, we focus on H+ insertion here and defer the analogous discussion for MnO2 dissolution to the SI (see Figure S4). Our goal is to identify reaction mechanisms by quantifying this effect and comparing it with experimentally observed capacities. We simulate how the electrolyte composition and pH value are influenced by a H+-insertion at the cathode, which reduces the [H+ T] concentration in the electrolyte (see Equation (13)). As the H+ insertion is balanced by the zinc metal dissolution, −2 · ∆[H+ T] = ∆[Zn2+ T ] holds.

However, the precipitation of ZHS is exper- imentally observed after a discharged capacity greater than 100 mA h g−1. Thus, the first discharge phase cannot be dominated by H+- insertion (or MnO2 dissolution) as experiments find no ZHS precipitation in this phase. In the non-equilibrium case for dis- charge at realistic rates, diffusion limitations further accelerate local pH change and ZHS precipitation as we discuss in detail in the Supporting Information in Subsection 3.3. In combi- nation with the calculated electrode potentials (see Subsec- tion III A), we conclude that the H+-insertion reaction, even if it is energetically favorable, must be strongly kinetically sup- pressed and is not relevant for the cycling mechanism found in MnO2-based ZIBs. C. Discharge Phases (Cell Model) As discussed above, the insertion of H+ into MnO2 cathode cannot dominate the first discharge phase. Thus, we model the discharge with the combination of Zn2+-insertion and Mn2+ dissolution at the cathode. We simulate the galvanostatic dis- charge of a laboratory coin cell in the presence of ZHS pre- cipitation and plot the discharge voltage in Figure 5a. The cell voltage shows two discharge phases with a voltage dip in between as generally reported in the literature1. The filled regions below the discharge curve represent the relative con- tribution of the Zn2+-insertion and Mn2+ dissolution reaction. The first discharge phase is dominated by the insertion of Zn2+. The Mn2+ dissolution onsets shortly before the volt- age dip and becomes relevant in the second discharge region.

Thus, ZHS precipitation is required to reproduce the two distinct discharge phases. Thus, we analyze electrolyte pH and average ZHS volume fraction ϵZHS during discharge in Figure 5b. ZHS precipitation is limited to the second discharge phase. Its onset is correlated with the voltage dip in Figure 5a. The pH value increases during the first phase of discharge. At the end of the first phase, the pH rises sharply until it is reduced again at the onset of ZHS precipitation. During the second phase, electrolyte pH slowly increases at first before strongly raising near the end of discharge. We can rationalize this behavior based on the chemical re- actions for Zn0.5MnO2 dissolution and Zn2+ insertion. Dur- ing discharge, Zn0.5MnO2 dissolution releases OH– into the electrolyte (see Equation (16)) so that the electrolyte becomes more alkaline. While the rate of Zn2+ insertion is indepen- dent of pH, the equilibrium voltage of Zn0.5MnO2 dissolu- tion (see Equation (17)) strongly decreases with electrolyte", "page": 5, "position": 2}

At the highest rate, the voltage dip and the additional capacity of the second phase are not present. cell voltage drops and Zn0.5MnO2 dissolution accelerates. As a consequence, the pH value increases quickly and ZHS starts to precipitate (see Figure 4). The pH-driven precipitation (see Figure 3) removes OH– from the electrolyte and stabilizes the pH near its saturation limit. ZHS precipitation makes possi- ble significant Zn0.5MnO2 dissolution without its self-limiting mechanism. This interplay between ZHS precipitation and Zn0.5MnO2 dissolution, which is first described by our theory, is key to our consistent model of the cycling mechanism of MnO2- based ZIBs. The Zn0.5MnO2 dissolution, while energetically more favorable, is a self-limiting reaction in the first discharge phase without precipitation. The onset of ZHS precipitation, observed as a nucleation dip in cell voltage, stabilizes elec- trolyte pH and resolves the self-limitation of pure Zn0.5MnO2 dissolution. In the second discharge phase, the dissolution of the Zn2+-inserted manganese oxide Zn0.5MnO2 contributes significantly to the overall capacity and drives the precipi- tation of ZHS. During charging, the ZHS will be dissolved again and the cathode is redeposited. Laboratory ZIBs are often optimized with respect to capacity and thus designed towards significant Zn0.5MnO2 dissolution. However conver- sion electrodes are prone to shape change44 and the deposition process of MnO2-structures can change its crystal structure53. Thus, we expect that this common optimization strategy lim- its cycle life and induces accelerated aging. We propose to reduce Zn0.5MnO2", "page": 6, "position": 1}

At the end of the charge, the sharper voltage decline is associated with a more rapid increase of the pH. a galvanostatic charge and discharge, both at the same current density. Figure 6, shows the charge and discharge potentials of the second cycle. During charging, we find two clearly sep- arated phases without a separating voltage dip. The voltage dip between the phases is present at low currents but disap- pears at higher rates. The contribution of the second phase is decreasing with increasing currents and is fully suppressed at high currents. This shows how sensitive the voltage reacts to variations in cycling currents. In turn, small differences in material preparation and cell design can also strongly affect cell behavior. IV. DISCUSSION In the following section, we compare the behavior of our theory-based model with experimental observations from the literature to validate our approach. Hereby, we compare the (dis)charge voltages, investigate the tempo-spatial profiles of pH evolution as well as precipitation within our cell model and present the results of cyclovoltammetry simulations in Sub- section IV A. Subsequently, we discuss strategies to increase cycling stability and reduce MnO2 dissolution and ZHS pre- cipitation by adding MnSO4 into the electrolyte, by increasing electrolyte volume, and by adjusting the cycling protocol (see Subsection IV B).

A. Validation We use literature data of measured cell potentials during cycling to validate our proposed cycling mechanism. Exper- imental results show two phases during discharge, separated by a voltage dip, which is reproduced by our model. A com- parison of experimental discharge voltages of δ-MnO2 coin cells, as found in References 17,18,23,52, with our simulation results is plotted in the Supporting Information in Figure S3. The experiments show the same discharge and charge behav- ior as our simulations, with two phases that are separated by a voltage dip during discharge (see Figure 6). Observed rate dependencies of the cycling behavior for δ-MnO2 as, for ex- ample, investigated by Guo et. al.54 and Ren et. al.52 show that the second-phase capacity is reduced significantly with increasing current densities. At high rates, it is also observed that the second phase might not even occur. This behaviour is similarly observed for other MnO2 polymorphs, e.g., for α-MnO215, ε-MnO255, and amorphous MnO256. In our com- putational study, we find that the second phase disappears at higher rates due to the slow kinetics of the precipitation re- action (see Figure 6). Quantitative differences between our simulation and the different lab cell measurements are a re- sult of different synthesis approaches, cell design and applied current. We summarize that our model reproduces the key ex- perimental features, i.e., the two discharge phases, the voltage dip, as well as the rate dependence of the two phases. The evolution of ZHS is measured by Putro et. al21 and Chen et. al.18. Their in-situ spectroscopy data show a re- versible growth and dissolution of ZHS during cycling, which is occurring in the second phase of discharge and the first phase of charge18,21.

Our model reproduces the reversible behavior of electrolyte pH and the sharp increase at the end of discharge found by Biro and coworkers32,57. Our simulations predict no signifi- cant pH gradient between the cathode and anode because our coin-cell geometry is significantly smaller than the laboratory setup of Biro and coworkers granting space for the pH mea- surement device. In combination with the excellent conduc- tivity of aqueous electrolytes, the rather uniform pH distribu- tion is according to our expectations. Cyclovoltammograms (CVs) are used in experiments to identify individual processes by their characteristic redox peaks. We perform cell simulations and elucidate the direct correlation of the characteristic of the CVs for MnO2-cathodes with the underlying electrochemical reaction. Figure 8 shows the simulated cyclovoltammograms of our cell model. We observe that the experimentally described separation of two redox peaks50,52,54 is predicted by our cell model.

Optimization Based on our cell model we investigate strategies to re- duce MnO2 dissolution and ZHS precipitation. In this sec- tion, we discuss the effect of MnSO4 as electrolyte additive and electrolyte volume variations. Finally, we present a mod- ified discharge protocol that allows for improving the inser- tion/dissolution ratio. The volume of the electrolyte influences pH stability and changes the precipitation dynamics of ZHS. Our calculations in Subsection III B showcase the sensitivity to excess elec- trolyte on a pH-driven precipitation reaction. In Figure 9, we present a study of cycling behavior for different elec- trolyte volumes based on our Zn2+-insertion/Mn2+-dissolution model. We implement a reservoir with excess electrolyte and increase the electrolyte amount, starting from 9.2 µL cm−2, which is the amount needed to fill the pore volume in the an- ode, separator and cathode.

The main part of Figure 10 evalu- ates the capacity at which ZHS precipitation is first observed. We find that the onset of the second phase with MnO2 disso- lution occurs later if larger amounts of MnSO4 are pre-added. In summary, MnSO4-additive effectively allows for a signifi- cantly larger discharge capacity in the first phase. Evaluation of the ratio of capacity from the Zn2+-insertion and capacity from Mn2+-dissolution gives a Zn2+ contribution of ≈62 % for a discharge at 2 A m−2, which is in agreement with the ex- perimental findings of Yang et. al.17. However, the change of this ratio is less than 1 % for cycling in pure ZnSO4 as com- pared to the electrolyte with 0.5 m MnSO4. We therefore find that MnSO4 helps to prolong the first phase, but does not sig- nificantly change the total discharge capacity and the relative contribution of the MnSO4-dissolution process. Recently published works on high-performance ZIBs all salvage the additional capacity achievable in the second dis- charge phase which is associated with cathodic dissolution58. However, experimental studies also report crystallographic changes in redeposited MnO2 during charging59–61. Addi- tionally, dissolution and redeposition of the MnO2-structure has been claimed to be a reason for reduced cycle life62. Therefore, limiting the cathode dissolution might help achieve higher cycling stability. Figure 11 shows the influence of a constant current-constant voltage (CC-CV) discharge profile on the achievable energy. We conducted discharge simula- tions with a constant current at the start, once a certain voltage is reached, the discharge is switched to potentiostatic mode. We varied the switching voltage between 1.1 V to 1.55 V. Here, we find that switching discharge modes from galvanos- tatic to potentiostatic mode has a significant leveraging effect on the cathodic dissolution. At the switching region around 1.3 V to 1.4 V, the cathode dissolution can be suppressed with- out sacrificing any of the capacity of the Zn2+-insertion pro- cess. V.

CONCLUSION This article discusses the relevance of proposed reaction mechanisms in the MnO2 cathode in ZnSO4 electrolyte, i.e., H+ insertion, Zn2+ insertion, and MnO2 dissolution. The cal- culated electrode potentials by DFT indicate that a H+ inser- tion reaction is energetically more favorable. Based on calcu- lations for electrolyte thermodynamics, however, we conclude that a H+ consuming reaction can not be dominant in the first half of discharge. Contrary to the expectations from MnO2- cathodes in alkaline electrolytes, the first discharge phase is thus dominated by the insertion of Zn2+ ions. The continuum cell model for ZIB cells with MnO2 cath- odes developed in this work reproduces the two-phase cycling behavior. It is used to investigate the critical role of ZHS pre- cipitation for the second discharge phase. This work proposes feedback between the cathode’s electrochemical dissolution and the stabilizing effect of ZHS dissolution on electrolyte pH.

For this purpose, the Vienna ab initio simula- tion package (VASP) was applied, using the Projector Aug- mented Wave (PAW) method to describe the electron-core interaction63–66. While exchange and correlation were ac- counted for by the generalized gradient approximation in the formulation of Perdew, Burke and Ernzernhof (PBE) an addi- tional Hubbard-like correction - with a U parameter of 3.9 - was included to describe the localized character of the Mn d- electrons67,68. All calculations were based on supercells of a 9 atom δ-MnO2 cell that contained one water molecule, i.e., Mn2O4 · H2O, using an energy cutoff of 600 eV and a 7x14x5 K-point mesh for the unit cell, which was adapted accordingly for larger supercells. To investigate possible in- tercalation compounds, different numbers of Zn and H atoms were inserted in the respective supercells, corresponding to HxZnyMnO2 · H2O stoichiometries (with x and y equal to 0, 0.25, 0.5 and 1). The structures were relaxed with respect to lattice vectors and atomic positions, applying convergence criteria of 10×10−6 eV for the electronic self-consistency loop and of 1×10−3 eV Å −1 for the residual forces, respectively. A thermodynamic model based on the law of mass action was applied to calculate ion speciation and solubility. This modeling approach is based on existing works33,34,69,70. The cell-level simulations are conducted with a continuum model based on the quasi-particle method derived in our previous works33,34. The equilibrium calculations from the thermo- dynamic model are integrated into the cell-level simulations, assuming that complex formation reactions are much faster than typical time scales of the charge and discharge. The model consisted of a system of 12", "page": 10, "position": 0}

The equilibrium calculations from the thermo- dynamic model are integrated into the cell-level simulations, assuming that complex formation reactions are much faster than typical time scales of the charge and discharge. The model consisted of a system of 12 equations: 4 electrolyte- conservation-equations describing the electrolyte speciation, 3 solid-volume-conservation equations, 3 solute mass conti- nuity equations, electrolyte-charge continuity expression and 1 expression representing either the galvanostatic or poten- tiostatic condition. A P2D finite-volume model, with spatial resolution in electrolyte transport and cathodic diffusion, was implemented in Python. The differential-algebraic equations were solved with MATLABs fully-implicit ode15s solver. The cell model was parametrized based on recent de- signs for δ-MnO2 2032-like coin cells as presented in literature17,18,23,52. Parameters are mostly taken from the coin cells manufactured in the recent study of Chen and coworkers18, which are similar to most other designs. Cath- ode composition is a mixture of MnO2, acetylene black and a PVDF binder with 70:20:10 wt% with a mass loading of 2 mg cm−2. Relative volume fractions are calculated based on the theoretical densities of the materials. Pore volume mea- surements were reported in the studies from Shen et. al.71 and Corpuz et. al.14 in the range of 0.44 cm g−3 to 0.78 cm g−3. Here, we use a pore volume of 0.5 cm g−3 to calculate the porosity of the cathode and, combined with the mass loading, the resulting cathode thickness of 66 µm. The separator thick- ness is set to 150 µm72. If not stated otherwise, the electrolyte used is an aqueous solution of 2 m ZnSO4, 0.5 m MnSO4 and cycling of the cell is simulated under galvanostatic conditions at 200 mA g−1. The full details of the calculation and choice of parameters can be found in the Supporting Information.
