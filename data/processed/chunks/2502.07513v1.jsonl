INTRODUCTION Quantum technology has demonstrated promising ad- vantages in various of fields, including computing, com- munication, and simulation.[1–7] Quantum resources, such as coherence and entanglement, are essential in many quantum protocols as well as simulating the phys- ical models.[8–13] For example, quantum resources pro- vide substantial benefits in energy manipulation, namely the quantum battery.[14–33] Quantum battery based on the organic microcavity has been realized in experiments, showing great advantages on energy transportation.[34] The primary goal of quantum battery research is to ex- plore how to increase the energy storage capacity and/or maximize the speed of charging.[36–43] For example, the quantum battery has the maximal stored energy in the steady state if the battery and the charger have the same coupling strength with a shared common bath.[44]", "page": 0, "position": 0}

While quantum batteries can take advantage of quantum degrees of freedom, such as spin, to store and transport energy.[47, 48] Consider Nb noninteracting spins as the battery cells and Nc noninteracting spins as the charger cells. The battery and charger spins allow in- teractions, which is required for charging. See Fig. 1. ∗kunzhang@nwu.edu.cn † xhwang@nwu.edu.cn The above construction is called the central-spin model, or central-spin battery in our study.[49, 50] The central- spin model appears in various nanostructures, such as semiconductors, quantum dots, carbon nanotubes, and nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond.[51–54] Specifically, the hyperfine interaction between the spin of electrons in quantum dots and the spin of surrounding nuclei can be well described by the central-spin model.[55–57] Previous study has clarified the charging power of the central-spin battery. When the number of chargers is less than the number of batteries, we have the charg- ing power P ∝Nb 1/2; when the number of chargers is much larger than the number of batteries, we have the charging speedup, namely P ∝Nb 3/2.[58] Although the central-spin battery has a charging advantage due the co- herent collective interaction, the entanglement between the charger and the battery or inside the battery spins may prohibit the battery achieving the maximal energy storage.[35, 59–61] The", "page": 0, "position": 1}

CENTRAL-SPIN BATTERY Consider the central-spin battery, which has the Hamiltonian H = Hb + Hc + g(t)HI, (1) composed with the battery Hamiltonian Hb, charger Hamiltonian Hc, and their interaction HI. Specifically, we have Hb =ωbSz, (2a) Hc =ωcJz, (2b) HI =λ(S+J−+ S−J+) + 2∆SzJz.

Correspondingly, we have the spin ladder operators J± = Jx ± iJy and the S± = Sx ± iSy. The parameters ωb and ωc character- ize the onsite energy of the battery and charger spins, corresponding to the strengths of the external magnetic field.

Due to the flip-flop interaction, the battery spins will be excited to high-energy states at the cost of decreasing the num- ber of spin-up charging units. The charging process is accomplished by turning on the HI interaction between the battery and the charger. Here g(t) is the switch func- tion, which equals to 1 in t ∈[0, τ] while zero elsewhere. The time τ represents the charging time. In our previous work,[35] it has been proved that the battery performance is best in the case of ∆= 0. Therefore, we only consider ∆= 0 in this work. The charging process of the central- spin battery is shown in Fig. 1. To maximize the energy transportation in the charging process, we set the following initial states. At time t < 0, the battery spin is prepared in the ground state, i.e., all spins are down |0⟩b ≡| ↓1, ↓2, · · ·, ↓Nb⟩b. (3) While the charger spins are all prepared in the excited states |n⟩c ≡| ↑1, ↑2, · · ·, ↑Nc⟩c, (4) with n = Nc. So the total initial state is |ψ(0)⟩= |0⟩b ⊗ |n⟩c. When Nc > Nb, the energy of the charger spins in the initial state is larger than the energy which can be filled in the battery.[35] Because of the flip-flop type interaction of the central- spin battery, the total spin in the z direction is conserved, that is, [Jz + Sz, H] = 0. Therefore, we can reformulate the dynamics into the subspace with the same number of spins Hn = {|0⟩b|n⟩c, |1⟩b|n −1⟩c, · · ·, |d⟩b|n −d⟩c}. (5) The parameter d is defined as d = min{Nb, Nc}.

Individual charging: Nb = 1 First, consider the simplest case with Nb = 1, namely one battery spin charged by Nc charger spins. The initial state is |ψ(0)⟩= |0⟩b⊗|Nc⟩c.

(12) Then the energy transported from the charger to the bat- tery is ∆E(t) ≡Tr (Hbρb(t)) −Tr (Hbρb(0)) . (13) Substitute the reduced density matrix ρb(t) in Eq. (12) and the battery Hamiltonian in Eq. (2a), then we have ∆E(t) = ω sin2 \u0010p Ncλt \u0011 . (14) Obviously, if the charging process stops at τ = π/(2λ√Nc), the energy transportation ∆E(t) achieves the maximal ∆E(τ) = ω. The one battery spin is fully charged.

For Nb battery spins, the total energy transport is Nbω. Although the maximal energy transportation is guaran- teed in parallel charging, it does not provide any quantum advantage on charging speedup.[46] We focus on collective charging in the following sections. B. Collective charging: Nb = 2 Suppose that the charger spins is outnumbered the bat- tery spins, namely Nb ≤Nc. If Nb = 2, the invariant subspace is spanned by the basis {|0⟩b|Nc⟩c, |1⟩b|Nc − 1⟩c, |2⟩b|Nc −2⟩c}. Then the Hamiltonian is simply a 3 × 3 matrix in such basis, given by H =   ω(Nc/2 −1) λ√2Nc 0 λ√2Nc ω(Nc/2 −1) 2λ√Nc −1 0 2λ√Nc −1 ω(Nc/2 −1)  . (15) Then we can analytically solve the eigenproblem. The Hamiltonian has the eigenvalues e1 =ω(Nc/2 −1), (16) e2 =ω(Nc/2 −1) + λ p 2(3Nc −2), (17) e3 =ω(Nc/2 −1) −λ p 2(3Nc −2).

(19) Then we can get the evolution state |ψ(t)⟩based on Eq. (9). Tracing out the charger spins, we have the density matrix of the battery spins ρb(t) = ρ11(t)|0⟩b⟨0| + ρ22(t)|1⟩b⟨1| + ρ33(t)|2⟩b⟨2|, (20) where ρ11(t) = 1 (3Nc −2)2 (2 (Nc −1) + Nc cos(¯ωct))2 , ρ22(t) = Nc 3Nc −2 sin2 ¯ωct, ρ33(t) =2Nc(Nc −1) (3Nc −2)2 (1 −cos(¯ωct))2 , (21a) with ¯ωc = λ p 2(3Nc −2).

(22) The transported energy reaches the maximal at τ = π/¯ωc. And the corresponding maximal transported en- ergy is ∆E(τ) = 16ωNc(Nc −1) (3Nc −2)2 . (23) Note that the battery-charger interaction strength λ is directly related to the optimal charging time τ. While the maximal transported energy is proportional to ω. When Nc = 2, the battery with two spins can be fully charged, namely ∆E(τ) = 2ω. However, the maxi- mal transported energy decreases with the increasing of the charger number Nc. See Fig. 2. Asymptotically Nc →∞, we have ∆E(τ) →16ω/9. Although increas- ing the number of charger spins can reduce the charging time in the collective charging, the battery can not be fully charged. We can also see that the diagonal terms (population) of the battery density matrix becomes ρ11(τ) →1 9, ρ22(τ) →0, ρ33(τ) →8 9, (24) as Nc →∞.

Since the quantum state of the battery-charger system remains in a pure state over the course of time evolution, the battery-charger entanglement can be well character- ized by the von Neumann entropy of the battery state (or the charger state). Specifically, the von Neumann entropy of the battery state is given by Sb(t) = −Tr (ρb(t) log2 ρb(t)) , (25) which also equals to the von Neumann entropy of the charger state. Since the battery has a pure initial state, it has a zero von Neumann entropy Sb(0) = 0. For incoherent quantum batteries, entanglement is a necessary condi- tion for generating extractable work during the charging process.[61] At τ = π/¯ωc, the battery has the maximal stored energy. We find that the corresponding von Neu- mann entropy of the battery state is given by Sb(τ) = h \u0012 Nc −2 3Nc −2 \u00132! , (26) with the binary Shannon entropy function h(x) = −x log2 x −(1 −x) log2(1 −x). (27) Since h(x) is monotonic increasing with x in 0 ≤x ≤1/2, the von Neumann entropy Sb(τ) increases with Nc. See Fig. 2. Intuitively, increasing the number of charger cells would decrease the optimal charging time, which is valid in the central-spin battery. However, larger num- ber of charger spins would generate more battery-charger entanglement, which is against the battery to be fully charged.", "page": 3, "position": 1}

In other words, Nb battery spins can only be double excited, while others are re- mained in the ground state. In this case, the Hamiltonian can also be cast into a 3×3 matrix, which is analytically tractable. Following the similar procedure in the last subsection, we find that the transported energy is ∆E(t) = ω (3Nb −2)2 \u0010 Nb(Nb −2) cos2(¯ωbt) −8Nb(Nb −1) cos(¯ωbt) + Nb(7Nb −6) \u0011 , (28) where ¯ωb = λ p 2(3Nb −2).

Uniform behaviors of energy transportation In the previous section, we have established analyt- ical results on the maximal transported energy ∆E(τ) and the battery-charger entanglement Sb(τ) with Nb = 2 or Nc = 2. Although the battery-charger entanglement is necessary during the charging process in central-spin quantum battery, any entanglement after the charging process is unwanted since it is against the battery to be fully charged.[35] As Nb ≫Nc or Nc ≫Nb, the degrees of freedom of battery or charger is dominated. Therefore, it is expected that the battery and the charger become more entangled. We conjecture that the battery has the maximal transported energy per battery cell at Nb = Nc. The invariant subspace method introduced in Sec. II allows us to numerically track the dynamics with larger number of spins. First, we take the number of battery cells Nb as 100, 150, 200. Then calculate the maximal transported energy with different numbers of Nc (by nu- merically finding the optimal charging time τ). See Fig. 4(a). The maximal transported energy per battery cell, namely ∆E(τ)/Nb, is largest at Nb = Nc, which is con- sistent with our analytical results on Nb = 2. Figure 4(a) shows an interesting uniform behavior of the maximal transported energy. To give a fair compari- son, we plot the maximal transported energy per battery cell in terms of the battery-charger ratio Nc/Nb. See Fig. 4(b). In such battery scales, namely Nb = 100, 150, 200, we find that the maximal transported energy per battery cell scales almost perfectly identical. By further increasing the battery scale, we find that the uniform characteristics is breaking. See Fig. 4(c). Oscil- lation appears as Nb ≥500.

Nev- ertheless, the resonant condition Nb = Nc always gives the largest transported energy in the central-spin model, which numerically verify our conjecture. B. Entanglement and energy transportation at Nb = Nc In Sec. III, we know that all the charger energy can transport to the battery when Nb = Nc = 2, which is the most economic charging protocol. Even though we know that the battery has the maximal transported en- ergy ∆E(τ) at Nb = Nc, it does not guarantee that all the charger energy can be completely transport to the battery. First, we study how the size of the battery cells Nb with Nb = Nc influence the maximal transported energy per battery cell ∆E(τ)/Nb. See Fig. 5. The perfect charging only occurs at Nb = Nc = 2. As the number of battery cells increases, the maximal transported energy per bat- tery cell decreases. However, the energy transportation returns to the optimal as Nb = Nc →∞. We have a minimum of ∆E(τ)/Nb around Nb = 7. It is expected that the battery-charger entanglement behaves inversely, namely having the minimum at Nb = Nc = 2. Then increases with the number of battery cells. We can see that the maximal transported energy per battery cell is closely related to the battery-charger entanglement per battery cell. See Fig. 5. Based on the above results, we propose the optimal charging protocol for the central-spin battery as follows.

For relative large size of battery, pair all the battery cells with the same number of charger cells, then collectively charge the battery to the maximal, with the almost full capacity. Note that it is also worthwhile to apply the collective charging protocol as the battery size is large in the viewpoint of quantum charging speedup. V. CONCLUSION AND OUTLOOK In this work, we systematically analyse the energy transportation in central-spin battery. First, we ob- tain analytical results on the battery capacity and the battery-charger entanglement with Nb = 2 or Nc = 2. The analytical results clearly show that the battery has the maximal capacity when Nb = Nc = 2. Therefore we conjecture that the resonant condition Nb = Nc al- ways gives the maximal (central-spin) battery capacity, and numerically verify it up to 2000 battery cells (spins). Second, for midsize battery, namely Nb ∼150, we find a uniform relationship between the energy capacity (per charger cell) and the battery-charger size ratio Nc/Nb. The uniform relation for the midsize battery also gives a tight upper bound on the energy capacity when the bat- tery cells become large. Third, we demonstrate the uni- versal inverse relationship between the battery capacity and the battery-charger entanglement. Since the highest excited state of the battery spin, corresponding to the maximal battery storage, is a pure state, it is expected that any battery-charger entanglement prohibits the bat- tery to reach the maximal energy capacity. It is also consistent with general theory of quantum battery.[61] Charging process is a typical nonequilibrium dynam- ics, which is a challenging problem especially for the many-body system. The uniform behavior of the battery capacity may suggest that the conserved charges,[63, 64] which are independent on the number of spins, play a role here.
