We apply density functional theory (DFT), ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD), and quantum chemistry techniques to examine excess-electron-induced FEC molecular decomposition mecha- nisms that lead to FEC-modiﬁed SEI. We consider one- and two-electron reactions using cluster models and explicit interfaces between liquid electrolyte and model LixSiy surfaces, respectively. FEC is found to exhibit more varied reaction pathways than unsubstituted ethylene carbonate. The initial bond-breaking events and products of one- and two-electron reactions are qualitatively similar, with a ﬂuoride ion detached in both cases. However, most one-electron products are charge- neutral, not anionic, and may not coalesce to form eﬀective Li+-conducting SEI unless they are further reduced or take part in other reactions. The implications of these reactions to silicon-anode based LIB are discussed. 1 arXiv:1401.4165v1 [cond-mat.mtrl-sci] 17 Jan 2014", "page": 0, "position": 0}

INTRODUCTION Solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) ﬁlms that passivate low voltage anode surfaces are im- portant for lithium ion battery operations.1–5 These ﬁlms arise from electrochemical reduc- tion and subsequent breakdown of the organic solvent-based electrolyte, which is unstable under battery charging potentials. With the correct choice of electrolyte, stable SEI ﬁlms are formed, blocking further electron transfer from the anode to the electrolyte, yet permit- ting lithium (Li+) transport. Small amounts of additives are often added to the electrolyte to modify the structure and performance of SEI ﬁlms. Additives may be particularly important for the next generation of anode battery materi- als like silicon (Si), tin, and other alloys. For example, Si promises much higher lithium ion capacities than commercially used graphite anodes.6 However, Si exhibits large volumetric expansion during Li intercalation. This often results in cracking, leading to detachment of particles from each other7,8 and perhaps from SEI ﬁlms formed during previous cycles. There appears to be a need to continuously reform the SEI layer after each cycle, leading to consumption of Li+. Thus, in general, Si anodes have not been suﬃciently stable over hun- dreds of charge/discharge cycles to be useful for commercial automobile batteries. SEI ﬁlms on traditional graphite anodes yield less capacity fade, even though chemical compositions of SEI ﬁlms on the two materials appear similar.9–16 Recently, ﬂuoroethylene carbonate (FEC, Fig. 1a) was found to improve the cycling be- havior of silicon electrodes in half cell conﬁgurations.17–25 Electrochemical impedance spec- troscopy revealed that FEC-modiﬁed SEI ﬁlms on Si yield lower Li+ transfer resistance, while atomic force microscopy reported smoother SEI surfaces. Mass spectroscopy and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy techniques showed little evidence of C-F covalently- bonded motifs in the SEI layers. Beyond these broad areas of agreement, details of SEI structure and composition reported by diﬀerent groups diﬀered. There are discrepancies regarding whether FEC increases the ﬁlm thickness and LiF composition, and regarding whether FEC and vinylene carbonate (VC) have similar additive eﬀects.

Concerns about theoretical accuracy can be alleviated by using multiple density functional theory (DFT) and quantum chemistry methods to cross- check predictions. The role of electrode surfaces in promoting/hindering SEI ﬁlm formation reactions can also be elucidated. Many insightful and evocative modeling works on bare crystalline Si bulk,39 surfaces40–43 and their interactions with lithium metal (as Li+ source) have been published, but so far they have not focused on SEI formation mechanisms. The Si models used in these works also tend to be bare Si surfaces, which can exist only under ultrahigh vacuum (UHV), not electrochemical, conditions. Our modeling eﬀort focuses on the initial steps of FEC decomposition, disputes the HF and CH2CHF reaction pathways proposed in the literature, and reveals lower barrier reaction mechanisms. Our work also explores subsequent SEI-formation steps that can occur. The two types of model used here dovetails with the two regimes of SEI ﬁlm formation widely associated with EC/dimethyl carbonate (DMC) mixtures on graphite anodes and freshly cut metal surfaces.2,3,28 The initial step consists of fast, two-electron attack; the later stage involves one-electron reduction of solvent or salt molecules. The latter dominates when electron tunneling/transfer through the half-formed SEI layer slows down. This two-stage mechanism may be consistent with the two-layer SEI structure revealed in experiments. An inorganic inner layer conducting Li+", "page": 2, "position": 0}

This surface is meant as a prototype to study the fast, two-e−electron transfer regime. It is meant to mimic battery charging-induced Si cracking events that expose SEI-free surfaces to the electrolyte. This can take place during the initial or subsequent charge cycles. The anode stochiometry is chosen to represent one of the strongly lithiated Li-Si crystalline phases,47 which are in turn models for disordered Li-Si alloys in cycled materials. Unlike the more commonly studied Li15Si4 stoichiometry, the orthonormal unit cell of crystalline Li13Si4 exhibits three unequal lattice constants. This inequality facilitates lattice-matching to model oxide ﬁlms on anode surfaces. Rapid FEC decomposition induced by two e−transfer is observed. One-electron decomposition of FEC is examined using cluster-plus-dielectric models in the absence of the silicon electrode. Such calculations were pioneered by Balbuena and coworkers and are valid for reactions that take place in the bulk liquid region.31–33 We also address the role played by silicon oxide. Theoretical studies of silica and related oxides in the context of lithium-ion batteries have been conducted,48–50 but SEI ﬁlm forma- tion reactions on those surfaces were not a focus. It may be argued that silicon anodes should qualitatively diﬀer from graphite with respect to initial SEI formation. Unlike graphite, sil- icon samples are generally covered with a native oxide layer about 20 ˚A thick. Recent work demonstrated that SEI ﬁlms on cycled silicon anodes contains buried SiO2 and/or lithium silicate derived from SiO2.51 This dense oxide/silicate insulating layer may slow down e− transfer suﬃciently during initial charging that the two-electron regime entirely vanishes.52 Therefore a computational model that includes an electrode as well as a passivation oxide layer is also considered.

METHODS Finite temperature ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations are conducted un- der solvent-immersed electrode conditions to study two-electron-induced FEC decomposi- tion. These calculations are performed using the Vienna Atomic Simulation Package (VASP) version 4.653,54 and the PBE density functional.55 A 400 eV planewave energy cutoﬀand a 10−6 eV convergence criterion is applied at each Born-Oppenheimer time step. Tritium masses on EC are substituted for protons to permit a time step of 1 fs. The trajectories are kept at an average temperature of T=450 K using Nose thermostats. The elevated tem- perature reﬂects the need to “melt” EC, which has an experimental freezing point above room temperature, and to improve sampling eﬃciency.56 In real batteries DMC cosolvent molecules reduce the viscosity, but DMC is not included herein. As a result, bond-breaking reactions observed in this work reﬂects accelerated kinetics pertinent to T=450 K. Several types of simulation cells are considered. One has dimensions 15.84×33.00×13.32˚A3 and contains an apolar Li156Si48 slab with a zero dipole mo- ment perpendicular to the exposed (010) surfaces. The bulk Li13Si4 structure is taken from Ref. 47. For that system, the (010) surface is found to be among the lowest energy low index surfaces.57 The vacuum gap between the exposed surfaces is ﬁlled with 32 EC molecules, which are pre-equilibrated using Monte Carlo simulations with the Towhee Monte Carlo code, and simple molecular force ﬁelds described in earlier works.58,59 Then 8 of the 32 EC molecules at the electrode surfaces are replaced with FEC and Monte Carlo is resumed for 5000 passes. This spatial distribution of molecules faciliates FEC decomposition over EC. Finally, AIMD is initiated using 2×1×2-point Brillouin zone sam- pling. During experimental preparation of battery cells, the voltage is lowered slowly. The higher reductive potentials of additives mean that they are ﬁrst decomposed before other electrolyte components are reduced. (See however Ref. 60 for an alternate interpretation.) Strict voltage control is lacking in these AIMD simulations,61 which are meant to mimic post-LixSiy cracking during cycling conditions, not electrode preparation. Thus, we have used spatial variations in additive compositions to enhance preferential FEC decomposition.", "page": 4, "position": 0}

Each oxide ﬁlm amounts to a bilayer of SiO4− 4 units surrounded by Li+ ions. The cell dimensions are 15.84×44.40×13.32˚A3. Details about this oxide-covered model anode will be discussed in future publications. Finally, we consider an AIMD trajectory without an electrode. 31 EC, 1 FEC, 1 Li+, and an excess electron reside in this (15.24˚A)3 simulation cell. A liquid cell conﬁguration of 32 EC and Li+ is taken from Ref. 58. One EC coordinated to Li+ is replaced by an FEC molecule which is deformed into a geometry that resembles an FEC−(see the Results sections below), and then an e−is added. When AIMD is initiated from this conﬁguration, the excess e−is found to be successfully localized on the FEC molecule. Static cluster-based, static optimization calculations apply DFT/PBE and M¨oller-Plesset second order perturbation (MP2) in conjunction with the Gaussian (G09) suite of programs63 and the “smd” dielectric continuum approximation.64 The dielectric constant ϵ is set to 40, which approximates the environment of the entire battery electrolyte, not just liquid EC. Geometry optimization is performed using the 6-31+G(d,p) basis set. Single point energies are computed at the 6-311++G(3df,2pd) level of theory. Vibrational frequencies are calculated for stable structures and transition states using the smaller basis, yielding zero point energies and thermal corrections to electronic energies. The DFT/PBE functional is chosen to complement AIMD/PBE simulations in this work, and the MP2 method is picked to be consistent with MP2 calculations in one of the authors’ previous work28 and other modeling eﬀort in the literature.34,35 Both (EC)2FEC−:Li+ and FEC−:Li+ clusters are considered. The larger cluster is chosen to reﬂect a previous AIMD prediction that Li+ is coordinated to slightly more than 3 EC molecules in EC liquid if one EC contains an excess electron.58 Hybrid DFT functionals65–67 are used for studies of FEC:Li50 and FEC:Li+:Si16H15 clus- ters.

Pristine Electrodes We ﬁrst consider unbiased AIMD simulations of liquid electrolyte in contact with the (010) surfaces of a Li13Si4 slab. Figs. 1d and 1e depict snapshots at the t = 0 and t = 4 ps points of an AIMD trajectory. On the upper surface of Fig. 1e, three FEC molecules have spontaneously absorbed two e−from the electrode, each breaking ﬁrst one CC-O1 or CC-O2 bond and then the other (two are shown in Fig. 1e). An F−anion is ejected almost simultaneously. This leaves CO, F−, and C2H3O− 2 as products. Fig. 1b zooms in on these fragments. In one of them, a C-H bond has also cleaved, releasing a hydrogen atom that becomes a H−bound to a Si atom on the anode surface (Fig. 1b). Even in this case, the product cannot be considered “HF.” On the bottom surface (Fig. 1e), a F−is ejected before any other bond breaking occurs. The resulting C3H3O− 3 anion then initiates nucleophilic attack on the CC atom of a neighboring intact EC molecule (see Fig. 1c for details). This may be the initiation of oligomer formation. No HF or CH2CHF is released, contrary to mechanisms proposed in the literature.29,30 By the nature of the simulation, the decomposition reactions observed are not imposed by any assumption, but are the natural manifestations of low-barrier mechanisms. Along this trajectory, after another 5.6 ps, two EC and another FEC molecule on the surfaces decompose (not shown). The two EC molecules absorb two e−each to form CO/C2H4O2− 2 and C2H4/CO2− 3 , as has been observed on Li+ intercalated graphite edges.58 The newly reacting FEC forms CO, C2H3O− 2 , and F−, the majority product in Fig. 1e. No further dimerized product is observed. While we have only considered one AIMD trajectory with a single initial, force-ﬁeld pre-equilibrated conﬁguration, the multiple bond-breaking events observed, to some extent, serve as a reasonable sized sample of chemical reactions.

Among the fragments observed on these Li13Si4 surfaces, F−should precipitate with Li+ to form LiF(s), which is a part of the SEI. The R-CHO−functional groups of the organic anionic fragments (Fig. 1b) are reactive and may participate in further nucleophilic attacks on intact solvent molecules, like the 2-e−decomposition products of EC.28 Unlike 2-e−attack on EC,28,31 CO2− 3 formation is not observed. Appendix B also shows that a 2-e−induced CO2− 3 -releasing FEC reaction is exothermic but exhibits a high barrier when computed on a Si-cluster. Unlike EC2−,28 we have been unable to stabilize intact FEC2−molecular structures in a cluster geometry. FEC2−:Li+ complexes always spontaneously decomposes, whether a dielectric continuum treatment is used or not. Hence no cluster-based calculation of FEC2−bond-breaking barrier/reduction potential or direct comparison with AIMD/PBE reaction timescales following 2-e−reduction of intact FEC molecules can be made. B. Attempt at Modeling One-e−Mechanisms on Oxide-Covered Electrodes We have made a preliminary attempt at modeling 1-e−attacks on FEC in the presence of a Li13Si4 electrode, with each surface coated with a 7 ˚A thick Li4SiO4 layer so that the FEC liquid is no longer in contact with Li13Si4 surfaces (Fig. 1f). Two FEC are decompose in picosecond time scales. Despite the expectation that the oxide should slow down electron transfer and enhance 1-e−attack on FEC over 2-e−reduction, Bader charge decomposition analysis shows that the products are still consistent with 2-e−-induced reactions. The reason for 2-e−attack may be twofold. (1) The reduction potentials may favor double reduction of FEC, as in the case for EC.28 The proximity of the metallic electrode means that the dielectric constant at high frequencies remains large. High ϵ∞means that reorganization energies for both one and two e−transfer to FEC may be low, and therefore electron transfer through the oxide is fast. If that is indeed the case, two electron attack is the correct prediction. (2) However, AIMD/PBE overestimates e−tunneling rate due to DFT/PBE delocalization errors. This tendency has been discussed in Ref. 59. Thus, 2-e−attack on oxide-covered anode may be an incorrect DFT prediction.", "page": 7, "position": 0}

AIMD simulations in bulk liquid An AIMD trajectory of 31 EC, 1 FEC, 1 Li+, and an excess e−in the simulation cell is considered next. By design, the excess e−resides on the FEC molecule which is coordinated to the Li+, as discussed in Sec. II. After 5.3 ps, the initially intact FEC−breaks a CC- O1 bond, similar to the initial reaction step observed in most reactions on Li13Si4 surfaces (Fig. 1e). A snapshot of this conﬁguration is shown in Fig. 2. Using a diﬀerent force- ﬁeld pre-equilibrated initial conﬁguration, the same bond breaks after 16.0 ps (not shown). The bond-breaking time scales are slightly diﬀerent due to the stochastic nature of barrier crossing events. Intuitively, CC-O1 bond-breaking should be favored over CC-O2 because the electron-withdrawing F-atom should stabilize the -CHFO− 1 group. Unlike two-electron- induced reactions described in the previous section, the C-F bond has not broken and the F−has not yet detached from the FEC−in this trajectory. The reason for the intact C-F bond may be the lack of Li+ in the proximity to abstract F−and form a stable LiF cluster. This point will be reiterated in light of cluster-based calculations described below. B. Cluster Calculations: Intact FEC− Cluster-based predictions are depicted in Figs. 3-6. First we consider the geometries of metastable FEC−:Li+ complexes prior to bond-breaking events. Conﬁgurations A-D (Fig. 3a-d) are somewhat analogous to the EC−:Li+ geometry.31 The CC-OC bond is bent out of the plane containing the 5-atom ring, like EC−, but unlike charge neutral FEC or EC, because the CC atom is now sp3 (or “sp2.5”) hybridized to accommodate an extra e−. Unlike the more symmetric EC−:Li+, complex, there are four distinct binding geometries depending on whether Li+ and F reside in the same or opposite side of the 5-member ring, and whether they are on the same side of the bisecting plane perpendicular to the ring. Another conﬁguration, E (Fig. 3e), ﬁnds Li+ residing on the approximate bisector plane, only coordinated to OC. All 5 conﬁgurations are close in", "page": 8, "position": 0}

Conﬁguration A (Fig. 3a) is most stable according to the PBE functional. When MP2 is used, it is more stable than all other complexes except D (Fig. 3d) by a small 0.020 eV, which is within thermal energy of the MP2-predicted global minimum. Given the fact that neither DFT nor MP2 has attained chemical accuracy (i.e., a mean error of less than ∼0.04 eV compared to experiments), we will henceforth use A as the starting conﬁguration of all further cluster-based degradation studies. The most important metrics are the barrier heights measured against the most stable intact FEC−conﬁguration. A small uncertainty of ∼0.02 eV in the energy of the starting, unreacted complex merely adds a small amount to barrier heights and does not change the qualitative conclusions. Using Conﬁguration A to represent FEC−:Li+, the predicted MP2 reduction potential of FEC:Li+ is 0.75 V, which is 0.22 V higher than that of EC:Li+ based on a previous study at the same level of theory.28 This diﬀerence indicates that FEC:Li+ accepts an electron at higher voltages than EC:Li+. The experimental value appears to be ∼0.95 V.68 As men- tioned above, adding a second e−to the FEC−:Li+ cluster leads to immediate decomposition, and thus the reduction potential of intact FEC−cannot be computed. If the dielectric continuum approximation is omitted, the CC-O1 bond in A spontaneously breaks during geometry optimization regardless of whether PBE or MP2 is used. The resulting structure is similar to F (Fig. 3f, which is however optimized with a dielectric approximation, not in the gas phase). Recall that the same bond spontaneously breaks in AIMD simulations (Fig. 2). The same bond also breaks in C and D in the gas phase (no dielectric) during PBE optimization, while the CC-O2 bond does not. The next section focuses on decomposition initiated by CC-O1 bond-breaking. C.

The small (∼0.1 eV) discrepancies between MP2 and PBE barriers indicate that these reactions should be fast regardless of computational methods. A fast reaction rate is qualitatively consistent with the AIMD trajectory (Fig. 2) showing CC-O1 bond-breaking within picoseconds. Next we consider possible subsequent steps. Guided by 2-e−reactions (Fig. 1e), we next examine C-F bond cleavage that proceeds from F to G (Fig. 4a). MP2 calculations reveal that the reaction is exothermic by 0.55 eV (or 0.64 eV measured from the starting structure A, Table ??). The barrier from F to G is very small (0.12 eV, Table ??). (Using F as reference implies that F is suﬃciently thermalized following bond-breaking reaction from A.) The corresponding PBE values are 0.45 eV, 0.34 eV, and 0.26 eV, respectively. Hence the same two-step reaction seen in a majority of two-electron reactions (Fig. 1b) is also thermodynamically and kinetically viable for singly reduced FEC. Compared with the AIMD simulations depicted in Fig. 2, the reason the C-F bond remains intact there seems to have mostly entropic origins. The lone Li+ ion is far removed from the F atom in Fig. 2, and a longer trajectory appears necessary for Li+ to diﬀuse to and coordinate with the ﬂuorine atom so the latter can detach from the FEC−fragment. Due to the reactive nature of partially decomposed FEC−, numerous product channels and transition states exist for subsequent steps. In some cases the Li+ and/or detached F− ions are omitted to assist calculation of the speciﬁc barriers. These models mimic conditions such that Li+ and/or F−have “diﬀused away.” We next remove Li+ and F−from G and reoptimize the geometry to H. The conﬁguration shown in Fig. 4b is the most stable among several conformations separated by low rotational barriers. Our attempt to initiate attack on either the CC or CE atom of an intact EC molecule with the C or O atom of H leads to endothermic reactions with substantial barriers.

Even the likely overestimated MP2 CE-O cleavage barrier does not preclude the unimolecular reaction from occurring during battery charging time scales (< 1 hour) at room temperature. Note that the free energy of H is referenced to cluster A, which has a diﬀerent number of atoms, via Conﬁguration J (Fig. 4d to be discussed below). J is optimized with and without Li+ and F−; its free energy is assumed to be the same with or without these ions. Using this procedure, G (with Li+/F−) and H (without) are predicted to be similar in MP2 (PBE) free energy, within 0.19 eV (0.03 eV) of each other. This level of agreement is acceptable for our purposes. Depending on the rate of e−transfer through the nascent SEI ﬁlm and the concentration of intermediates, the radicals F and G may dimerize, or they may absorb extra e−and participate in further reactions, like EC−and EC2−.28 Enumerating subsequent reactions that may involve redox steps is beyond the scope of this work. The implication of proposed alternate fates of FEC on SEI formation is re-examined in Sec. V.

Cluster Calculations: Other Initiation Steps Again motivated by 2-e−reactions, we next consider the direct breaking of the C-F in A to form the charge-neutral radical J with an intact 5-atom ring. According to PBE calculations, the reaction is exothermic by 1.18 eV with a barrier of 0.614 eV. J can then undergo CE-O2 bond breaking to yield CO2 and ·CH2CHO (I, discussed above; purple line in Fig. 5). This unimolecular reaction that releases CO2 is reminiscent of a VC-based reaction predicted in Ref. 60 for the reaction between VC and EC−.

Unlike all other barriers considered so far, but analogous to breaking the same bond in the ring-opened radical (Ta- ble ??), the MP2 and PBE barriers diﬀer signiﬁcantly, as noted earlier. Even the likely underestimated PBE barrier listed here gives a values higher than breaking the CC-O bond (A→F), suggesting that CE-O bond cleavage is kinetically unfavorable in FEC−. (See also appendix B.) This A→K pathway is not further considered, but it may still occur if aided by the electrode surface. Breaking the CE-O1 bond is less exothermic; the barrier has not been computed because transition state searches have ended in the transition state that yields CE-O2 bond-breaking. Elimination of HF from FEC−yields conﬁguration L (Fig. 4f) which is endothermic by 0.20 eV (0.00 eV). No low barrier pathway for this two-bond-breaking reaction is found. E. Cluster Calculations: System Size Eﬀect So far, the results are derived using a cluster with one FEC, plus a dielectric continuum that represents spectator solvent molecules. In experiments, the solvent is often a combina- tion of EC and DMC, with FEC also present at low concentration. A more accurate way of representing the FEC−:Li+ solvation shell is to introduce more molecules. Conﬁgurations M-P (Figs. 6a-d) depict optimized geometries when two extra EC are included in the Li+ coordination shell. Using the PBE functional, the most favorable intact FEC conﬁgura- tion M (Fig. 6a) resembles the FEC−:Li+ cluster E (Fig. 3e), where Li+ only coordinates to one FEC−O atom. N (Fig. 6b) is analogous to A (Fig. 3a) and is metastable, but by only 0.070 eV. In contrast, MP2 predicts that M and N are almost isoenergetic, emphasizing the somewhat sensitive dependence of their free energy ordering on computational methods and cluster size.

The main ﬁnding of this subsection is that using the smaller Li+:FEC−complex may slightly overestimate reaction exothermicities. V. DISCUSSIONS At least two requirements must be satisﬁed for good electrolyte additives: 1) they should react at voltages higher than electrolyte solvents/anions to ensure the SEI ﬁlm is dominated by their breakdown products; 2) their reaction intermediates must also coalesce and/or further react to form SEI ﬁlms that eﬀectively transmit Li+ ions but block solvent and electron transport. Li+-containing ionic solids made up of negatively charged species from additive/electrolyte decomposition are likely crucial for Li+ transport. SEI made of purely charge-neutral oligomer products which do not contain Li+ are unlikely to conduct Li+ eﬃciently, or for that matter become dense/compact enough to block solvent transport. Hence, both prediction of reduction potentials and elucidation of decomposition pathways are needed to deﬁne computational screening criteria that lead to design of better additives.36 From this perspective, two-electron products (F−and C3H3O− 3 ) appear reasonable SEI components, although the latter contains X-CHO−groups that will likely undergo further reactions. Dimerization is observed; subsequent oligomerization may be possible. The most favorable sequence of one-electron reactions yields F−, uncharged radicals, and CO2. This suggests that the 1-e−route yields LiF, found in the SEI, and other uncharged organic products that, if they coaleasce, are likely neither very conductive to Li+ nor form compact, eﬀective SEI ﬁlms. However, it cannot be ruled out that CO2 and CHOCH2· can be further reduced electrochemically and then become part of the SEI. Indeed, CO2 reduction may yield oxalate (C2O42−), as reported in some measurements.18,20 The likelihood of these subsequent events should depend on the relative rates of electron transfer through the nascent SEI ﬁlm and of preciptation/nucleation of charged fragments on the electrode surface. Thus both 1- and 2-e−mechanisms lead to rapid release of F−to form LiF. We propose", "page": 13, "position": 0}

Hence FEC may generate LiF much more quickly. Polycarbonates, suggested in some of the FEC/Si-anode literature,18–20,22 is not directly observed in FECn−decomposition. A previous computational work by one of the authors proposed polycarbonate chain formation from two-electron reduction of ethylene carbon- ate (EC). Such chains are predicted to be unstable in high dielectric environments, their ROCO2R’ motifs as prone to electrochemical reduction and CC-O and CE-O cleavage as EC itself. However, if polycarbonate chains form large aggregates, the dielectric constant may be suﬃciently lowered that they are no longer susceptible to excess e−attacks. Thus poly- carbonates cannot be ruled out even though the experimental evidence for their existence does not appear conclusive. We have also performed preliminary calculations of FEC−decomposition on lithium silicate-covered electrode surfaces immersed in liquid electrolyte. This mixed oxide is known to be present after cycling silicon anodes in lithium ion batteries. The thin (∼7 ˚A) insulator oxide layers intervening between the metallic Li13Si4 and the electrolyte yield two-electron FEC decomposition reactions, and therefore appear not suﬃciently thick to perform the necessary function of slowing down e−transfer suﬃciently to limit FEC decomposition to 1-e−reactions. We have used PBE, MP2, and in one case, B3LYP methods to compute reaction barriers. In most cases the predictions are similar, within ∼0.1 eV of each other. The exception is breaking of the CE-O bond, where MP2(PBE) appears to overestimate (underestimate) the true barrier (see also appendix B). VI. CONCLUSIONS In conclusion, we have examined the decomposition mechanisms of ﬂuoroethylene car- bonate (FEC), which is a promising additive for improving passivating solid electrolyte in- terphase (SEI) ﬁlms on silicon anode surfaces in lithium ion batteries. Various mechanisms are examined using unconstrained AIMD simulations of explicit liquid electrolyte/Li13S4 interfaces and using cluster-based calculations. The two types of simulations are consistent with two- and one-e−attack on FEC, respectively. Multiple reaction products and pathways are observed in fast 2-e−induced FEC break- 15", "page": 14, "position": 0}

The main products are carbon monoxide or its precursor, F−anion, and negatively charged C- and O-containing fragments that may undergo further reactions. We also observe direct deﬂuorination of “FEC2−,” yielding a C3H3O− 3 fragment with an intact 5-atom ring which in turn initiates nucleophilic attack on a neighboring EC molecule. F−can precipitate to form LiF, which has been shown to be abundantly present in FEC-derived SEI ﬁlms,17–24 while the negatively charged organic fragments can also contribute to the Li+-conducting part of the SEI. Similar initial bond-breaking routes and F−ion release are also found during 1-e−induced reactions. While reaction pathways and products have not been exhaustively enumerated, the ﬁrst reaction is predicted to be the cleavage of the CC-O1 bond regardless of whether unbiased AIMD/PBE simulation or cluster-based MP2/PBE barrier calculation is used. This internal consistency suggests that the predictions are reasonable. The most probable single FEC−molecule products are predicted to be F−, CO2, and CHOCH2· radicals. Future experiments can validate this prediction by analyzing the gas product composition. Neither HF nor CHFCH2, proposed in the literature,29,30 is found as a favorable reaction product or intermediate.

Appendix A: FEC on Li metal cluster To corroborate two-electron reduction pathways predicted in Sec. III A using hybrid DFT functionals, which are generally more accurate than the DFT/PBE method applied in the main text, an FEC molecule was placed on the (100) surface of a 50 atom face-centered cubic (FCC) Li cluster and optimized for 100 steps at the B3LYP/6-31G level of theory65,66 using the “smd” dielectric continuum approximation (ϵ=40). The cluster consisted of four layers of Li (Fig. 7a). The two bottom layers are frozen during the optimization to help maintain the bulk FCC structure. Upon optimization, the FEC molecule decomposes on the surface. The initial and inter- mediate structures are shown in Fig. 7. The C-F bond stretches and the carbonyl oxygen migrates toward the surface (Step 20), causing the C-O bonds to break and form carbon monoxide (Step 40). The F atom dissociates and binds to the Li surface. These reaction features are characteristic of two-e−attacks seen in DFT/PBE-based AIMD simulations (Fig. 1e). In optimization step 80, the carbon monoxide fragment recombines with one of the O atoms of the remaining FEC fragment. In the ﬁnal step, a reduced “CO2 molecule” forms, although the CE-O distance remains small (1.61 ˚A) and it may be argued that the C3H3O3 fragment is one entity. The last (100th) optimization step corresponds to the lowest en- ergy structure found, with a root-mean-square error Cartesian force of 0.003 Hartrees/Bohr. F-containing solvent molecules for lithium air batteries have been predicted to react with lithium clusters in a similar way, by breaking C-F bonds after injection of electrons.71 Appendix B: FEC on Si-cluster A cluster model of Li+:Si15H16 is employed to simulate the Si(100) 2×1 surface and to examine FEC reduction reactions on the surface. This model system might be relevant to silicon anodes with native oxide ﬁlms etched away by HF gas treatment.11 The calculations are performed using the Gaussian 09 suite of programs and hybrid B3PW91 functional.65,67 Previous studies have shown that B3PW91 is reliable for the open-shell species involved", "page": 16, "position": 0}

Thermal corrections are included in the standard way, and analysis of atomic charges is generated using the CHelpG method.69 The adsorption energy Eads is deﬁned by Eads = Esub/ads−Esub−Eads, in which Esub/ads is the total energy of the optimized substrate- adsorbate structures, Esub is the energy of the substrate, and Eads is the energy of adsorbate. The Li+:Si15H16 substrate will be discussed in detail in a future publication.70 No dielectric continuum approximation is used in this appendix, and the reactions are therefore studied under ultra-high vacuum conditions. As discussed in the main text, both one-electron and two-electron mechanisms are possible for decomposition of FEC. We ﬁrst examine FEC adsorption on the optimized Si15H16-Li+ cluster. Three FEC adsorption modes are identiﬁed, as illustrated in Fig. 8. The major binding site is the carbonyl O (OC) and the Li+ in Conﬁgurations 1 and 2. 1 and 2 share similar geometries, and the only diﬀerence is the position of the F atom: one is toward the Si(001) surface, whereas the other is away from the surface. Not surprisingly, the DFT calculation indicates that the two conﬁgurations possess approximately the same adsorption energy (Eads = -1.14 eV). Two binding sites are observed in Conﬁguration 3: one is between the F atom and the Li+, and the other is between OC and a surface Si atom. The FEC adsorption is slightly weaker than that in 1 and 2, with an adsorption energy of -0.93 eV, suggesting that the OC-Li+ interaction is stronger than F-Li+. The FEC geometry shows little change in the adsorbed structures. The FEC-Li+-Si15H16 cluster may receive one or two electrons before decomposition takes place, depending on the reduction potential, applied voltage, and electron transfer rate. Our geometry optimization produces 7 stable structures for the one-electron transfer process. The most stable one, 4, is obtained by adding an electron to and optimizing from Conﬁguration 2, and the electron aﬃnity (EA) is -5.46 eV. The geometry of the FEC molecule is hardly changed in the process, implying no signiﬁcant electron structure", "page": 17, "position": 0}

The energetically most favorable structure is 5 gener- ated by 1 + 2e−→5 (combined ﬁrst and second EA = -7.99 eV). The overall conﬁguration of 5 diﬀers substantially from 1, in which the FEC molecule is away from the cluster and the ring plane is approximately perpendicular to the Si surface. The ring resides on the top of the cluster and is parallel to the Si(001) surface in Conﬁguration 5. Another stable structure, 6, is obtained using 3 as starting conﬁguration. The combined 1st and 2nd EA is -8.10 eV for 3 + 2 e−→6. In the electron transfer process, OC moves away from the Si surface. Therefore, only one major binding site between the F-atom and the Li atoms is found in 6. Analogous to Conﬁguration 4, most negative charge transfers to the Si15H16 cluster in 5 and 6. However, there is signiﬁcant ngative charge (∼84%) ﬂowing into the FEC molecule. For example, the net charge of FEC in 5 is −0.15|e| in comparison to 0.07|e| in 1. Next we examine the ﬁrst step of bond dissociation for both one- and two-electron decom- position mechanisms. Five bond-breaking modes A-E (not to be confused with conﬁguration labels in the main text) are illustrated in Fig. ??. For one electron mechanisms, bond cleav- age occurs via A, B, C, D and B/D. DFT calculations fail to locate intermediates and transition states for bond-breaking mode E. Hence C-F breaking may not be viable as an one-electron mechanism. The corresponding reaction energies (Ereac) and energy barriers (E∗) are listed in Table ??. Ereac vary between -0.48 eV and 0.68 eV. Bond cleavages via A, D, and B/D are exothermic whereas B and C are endothermic. This indicates that CE-O bond-breakings are thermodynamically favorable for the one-electron mechanism. However, they are not kinetically favorable due to the relatively high energy barrier (1.14-1.57 eV). The lowest energy barrier is Cc-O cleavage (mode C), with a value of 0.43 eV. The inter- mediates usually have more binding site(s) on the Si surface, primarily via the O and CE atoms. Four bond-breaking modes,", "page": 18, "position": 0}
