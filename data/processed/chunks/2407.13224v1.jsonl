This study comprehensively examined the structural, electronic, electrochemical, and energy storage properties of boron-vacancy induced porous boron nitride monolayers (BN:VB) as multifunctional materials, anodes for MIBs and H2 storage applications. Our computational approaches, density functional theory (DFT), ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD), and thermodynamic analysis, revealed exceptionally high energy and gravimetric densities for MIBs and H2 storage, respectively. We investigated the interactions of Li, Na, and K atoms on BN:VB, which strongly bonded with binding energies stronger than their bulk cohesive energies, which ensured structural stability and the absence of metal clustering. Electronic properties, analyzed through spin-polarized partial density of states (PDOS), band structure, and Bader charge analysis, revealed significant charge transfers from the metal atoms to BN:VB, enhancing the electronic conductivity of the latter. Theoretical specific capacities were calculated as 1821.53, 786.11, and 490.51 mA h/g for Li, Na, and K, respectively, which comfortably exceeded the conventional anodes, such as graphite. Average open-circuit voltages (OCVs) were found as 0.15, 0.25, and 0.32 V, for Li, Na, and K, respectively, indicating strong electrochemical stability.

Introduction The development of novel materials for energy storage plays a pivotal role in meeting the worldwide need for sustainable, ecofriendly, and effective energy solutions [1]. Metal-ion batteries (MIBs), particularly lithium-ion batteries (LiIBs), are fundamental to the operation of modern electronic devices and electric vehicles due to their high energy density, straightforward functionality, and long lifespan. The performance of MIBs batteries is highly dependent on the properties of the anode materials, which play a crucial role in determining the efficiency and longevity. Traditional anode materials face limitations in capacity and rate performance. For example, graphite, the conventional anode material for LiIBs, has a limited theoretical capacity of 372 mAhg-1, which is insufficient to meet the demands of next-generation batteries [2], [3]. As a result, there is an ongoing search for the novel materials that can offer higher capacity, better rate performance, and enhanced stability. Alternative materials, such as silicon, tin, and various forms of carbon, which exhibit higher theoretical capacities, have been explored. However, most of them often suffer from significant volume expansion during cycling, leading to rapid capacity fading and mechanical failure [4], [5], [6], [7]. In addition, the growing need for efficient energy storage systems, fueled by the popularity of portable electronics and electric vehicles, has underscored the limitations of LiIBs [8]. Concerns such as scarcity, high cost, and safety issues associated with lithium (Li) have prompted investigations into alternative battery systems such as sodium-ion (NIBs), potassium-ion (KIBs), magnesium-ion (MgIBs), calcium-ion (CaIBs), and zinc-ion batteries (ZnIBs) [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15]. These systems offer distinct advantages, such as abundance and wide distribution of raw materials, reduced costs, and sustainability. For example sodium (Na) and potassium (K) ranks as the sixth and seventh most abundant element in earth’s crust, respectively, making NIBs and KIBs promising alternatives [9], [13].

A major concern is attributed to achieving electrochemical performance comparable to LiIBs, as NIBs typically exhibit lower energy densities owing to the larger size of Na+ ions, resulting in reduced voltage and capacity [17], [18], [19]. Additionally, finding suitable electrode materials capable of effectively intercalating these metal atoms is intricate; for instance, graphite is inadequate for NIBs, necessitating exploration of alternatives like hard carbon and titanium-based compounds [20], [21]. Electrolyte stability and compatibility are also critical; MgIBs encounter issues with passivation layers that hinder ion movement [22], [23]. Furthermore, ensuring durability and efficiency over long cycles remains a challenge, evident in KIBs that undergo significant volume changes during use [24]. Overcoming these technical hurdles through ongoing research and development is essential to unlock the full potential of alternative MIBs [25]. Hydrogen (H2), on the other hand, is the simplest molecule possessing much higher energy density per unit mass than any other fuel and yield only water byproduct upon its usage in the fuel cell [26]. Despite these advantages, the efficient storage of H2 remains a technological hurdle towards adoption of H2-based economy. Traditional storage approaches, such as high-pressure gas cylinders and cryogenic liquid H2 tanks, pose safety and efficiency concerns. Consequently, solid-state H2 storage materials, including metal hydrides, complex hydrides, and porous materials, are under extensive investigation to achieve high H2 storage capacity at practical pressure and temperature conditions [38]. To address the storage challenge, the US Department of Energy (DOE) has set specific targets for onboard H2 storage systems, aiming for 5.5 wt % and 40 g/L by 2025 [27]. Over the last two decades, porous solid-state materials and their composites have emerged as promising contenders for H2 storage due to their unique attributes, such as customizable pore structures, large surface areas, and uniform porosity. Among these materials, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) [28], [29], covalent organic frameworks (COFs) [30], [31], porous organic polymers (POPs) [32], and carbon-based materials [33], [34] have attracted extensive attention for H2 storage applications. Despite these efforts, the limited storage capacity underscores the urgent need to explore alternative", "page": 2, "position": 0}

The intrinsic properties of pristine BN are largely defined by its atomic structure, where B and N atoms are alternately arranged in a hexagonal lattice. This configuration results in a wide band gap, typically ranging around 5.0 – 7.0 eV [40], [41], [42], [43], [44], making BN an excellent electrical insulator. This wide band gap is beneficial for applications requiring high dielectric strength and thermal stability. Moreover, the strong sp2 hybridization of the B-N bonds endows the material with excellent mechanical properties, including high tensile strength and flexibility [41]. However, the functional versatility of BN monolayers can be greatly enhanced by introducing atomic-scale modifications, such as vacancies, doping, and the adsorption of foreign atoms or molecules. One of the most extensively studied modifications is the creation of B vacancies (BN:VB). The removal of B atoms from the lattice creates localized states within the band gap that can act as traps for charge carriers or as reactive sites for chemical functionalization. Such modifications can transform the insulating BN monolayer into a material with tunable electronic properties, thereby broadening its potential applications [45]. In recent developments, the synthesis of a novel two-dimensional porous carbon structure, known as holey graphyne (HGY), has garnered significant attention. This structure, characterized by a periodic arrangement of six and eight-vertex rings, exhibits promising semiconductor properties with high electron and hole mobility at room temperature [46]. Furthermore, the uniform periodic holes within the HGY framework offer potential for energy storage applications. Researchers have investigated H2 storage capabilities within HGY structures decorated with Li and scandium (Sc), indicating promising opportunities for H2 storage [47] [48]. Building upon these advancements, Mahamiya et al. [48] explored the possibility of synthesizing a BN analog of the two-dimensional HGY structure. Through theoretical investigations, they have established the energetic and dynamic stability of the porous BN (Pr-BN) structure, suggesting its suitability for various applications. They reported exceptional catalytic activity of the Pr-BN structure towards the H2 evolution reaction (HER). Given these attributes, the proposed Pr-BN system holds promise for a range of applications in nano electronics,", "page": 3, "position": 0}

Computational Methods In this study, we utilized spin-polarized calculations to study the structural, electronic, and metal adsorption properties, as implemented in the \"Vienna Ab-initio Simulation Package\" (VASP) within the frameworks of DFT and the projected augmented wave (PAW) method [50]. The exchange and correlation interactions were addressed using Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof form of the generalized gradient approximation (PBE-GGA) functional [51]. The van der Waals (VdW) interactions were tackled using DFT-D3 method of Grimme [52]. For structural optimization, the convergence tolerances for total energy of 10-8 eV and atomic force of 0.01 eV/ Å were applied. In sampling the Brillouin zone, we utilized a Monkhorst-Pack technique [53] with k-mesh grid of size 5×5×1 for total energy calculation. A denser k-mesh grid of size 8x8x1 was used for the density of states calculations (DOS) and a plane- wave cut-off energy of 500 eV was utilized. Bader-charge analysis within the framework of VASP package was explored to calculate the charge transfer [54]. The average binding energy (𝐸𝑏𝑖𝑛𝑑) of metal atoms (MA) embedded in the pores of Pr-BN/BN:VB monolayer was calculated using the formula: 𝐸𝑏𝑖𝑛𝑑= 𝐸𝐵𝑁+𝑛𝑀𝐴−(𝐸𝐵𝑁+𝑛𝐸𝑀𝐴) 𝑛 (1), where 𝐸𝐵𝑁+𝑛𝑀𝐴, 𝐸𝐵𝑁, and 𝐸𝑀𝐴 stand for the total energies of the system of Pr-BN/BN:VB with and without the 𝑛 MA, and isolated MA, respectively. Furthermore, ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations were conducted to confirm the structural stability of MA-functionalized BN:VB at 400 K. Temperature control was achieved using the Nose-Hoover thermostat, employing a time step of 1.0 fs over an 8 ps simulation period.

Results and Discussions 3.1 Structural and Electronic Properties The system used in our study consists of the primitive cell of Pr-BN. The optimized structure shows a periodic pattern of six and eight-vertex rings, similar to HGY [49]. The Pr-BN has a structure of Bravais square lattice which belongs to the space group C51 (Pm #6) and its primitive cell (PC) contains 12 B and 12 N atoms as shown in Figure 1(i-a). The bond length between B and N atoms ranges between 1.30 to 1.49 Å. The range of different values of BN bond lengths attribute to a combination of three different types of bonding reported in the case of Pr-BN, sp2-sp2, sp2-sp, and sp-sp hybridized B and N atoms [49]. The lattice constants of Pr-BN are a= b= 10.96 Å, consistent with the values reported by Mahamiya et al. (a= b= 10.92 Å) [49]. Figure 1(i-b) shows that Pr-BN exhibit a nonmagnetic semiconductor characteristics with wide band gap of 4.21 eV, which is consistent with the literature [49]. Dąbrowska et al. reported that B vacancy (VB) is always formed during hexagonal BN (h-BN) synthesis, but with different concentrations and have shown more stability compared to N vacancy (VN) [45]. The existence of VB enhances the catalytic activity of h-BN [59]. Hence, to improve the catalytic activity and to tailor the properties of Pr-BN, we considered the effects of VB (i.e., BN:VB). The relaxed structure of BN:VB is shown in Figure 1(ii-a). The top view of the structure demonstrates the inward relaxation and the shift from an eight-vertex ring to a seven-vertex ring with N-N bond length of 1.35 Å. The side view of the relaxed structure reveals that the B-N-B bond within the seven- membered ring is elevated by 1.61 Å. This observation aligns with previous studies on defect-induced structural modifications, where vacancies and defects are known to cause significant local distortions and reconstructions in the lattice [60], [61]. We observe a ferromagnetic characteristic in BN:VB with a magnetization of 1 μB.

The adsorption of MA on Pr-BN is studied by examining the most stable and energetically favorable configurations among the five different initial structures, see Figure 2(a). Following the geometrical optimizations, it is observed that a single MA (Li, Na, K) tends to bind on top of site X1, exhibiting the lowest 𝐸𝑏𝑖𝑛𝑑 according to equation (1). However, it’s noteworthy that the resulting minimum 𝐸𝑏𝑖𝑛𝑑 of MA on Pr-BN is weaker than the cohesive energy (|𝐸𝑏𝑖𝑛| < |𝐸𝑐𝑜ℎ|), as seen in Figure 2(b). Consequently, we further investigated the adsorption of MA on BN:VB, as the VB was experimentally characterized and theoretically predicted to serve as an active adsorption site [59]. Like the case of Pr-BN, we considered all the available adsorption sites on BN:VB. The single MA prefers to bind inside the pore (site X1), forming bonds with the surrounding N atoms of BN:VB with average bond lengths of 2.0, 2.37, and 2.86 Å for Li-, Na-, and K@BN:VB, respectively. The calculated 𝐸𝑏𝑖𝑛 values of -4.45, -3.79, and -4.27 eV for Li, Na, K, respectively, are much stronger than their bulk 𝐸𝑐𝑜ℎ indicating strong MA bindings and the negligible possibility of metal clustering. Subsequently, we sequentially introduced further MA, in step-wise manner, on BN:VB. The first adsorbed layer comprises four MA with average 𝐸𝑏𝑖𝑛 values per dopants of -2.95, -2.17, and -2.23 eV for 4Li-, 4Na-, and 4K@BN:VB, respectively, as illustrated in Figure 3(i). This 4MA-layer serves as our accumulating step to reach the maximum specific capacity of BN:VB (i.e., 44Li, 28Na, and 20K), as shown in Figure 3(ii). Further details on these results are provided in the subsequent subsections. Based on Figure 3(i), the three 4MA@BN:VB systems retain their structural integrity without any noticeable deformations, implying excellent structural stabilities.

This fosters the stability of MA@BN:VB, thereby increasing their viability for MIBs anodes and H2 storage. It is worth mentioning that the average 𝐸𝑏𝑖𝑛𝑑 simulates the experimental synthesis of functionalization more realistically than the recursive energy, 𝐸𝑟𝑒𝑐, as shown in our previous work [57]. Next, the thermodynamic stability of 4MA@BN:VB is conducted using AIMD kinetics at 400 K over a period of 8 ps with step of 1 fs. Despite the buckling in the atomic structures of BN:VB after MA functionalization, the AIMD analysis indicates insignificant fluctuations in the total energies throughout the simulation, as shown in Figure 4(b).

The strong binding interactions between adsorbent and adsorbate can be manifested in the electronic properties. Accordingly, the electronic properties of BN:VB and MA@BN:VB are studied in terms of spin-polarized partial density of states (PDOS) and band structure plots. The PDOS plots for nLi@BN:VB, mNa@BN:VB, and lK@BN:VB are illustrated in Figure 5, where n, m, and l represent the total number of Li, Na, and K atoms, respectively. Based on Figure 1(b), the main effects of VB on the electron density of states appear near the Fermi region. Additionally, the existing asymmetry between the spin-up and the spin-down PDOS suggest magnetic properties and will be elaborated as follows. (a) For the nLi@BN system, the Li(s) orbitals interact with the B(p) and N(p) orbitals in both the valence and conduction bands. A significant shift in PDOS is observed after 4Li decoration compared to BN:VB. Moreover, 4Li@BN:VB preserves its magnetic semiconductor character with a reduced bandgap of 0.17 eV and 1.42 eV for spin-up and spin-down states, respectively. The system exhibits a drastic change upon reaching the maximum specific capacity of 44Li atoms and transforms to nonmagnetic metal, suggesting that MA adsorption influences the electronic and magnetic properties of BN:VB by passivating all dangling bonds and consequently the magnetization disappears. Similar trends in the electronic properties are observed in the cases of (b) mNa@BN:VB and (c) lK@BN:VB systems as shown in Figure 5. Thus, the spin-polarized PDOS demonstrate the impact of MA decoration on the electronic properties of BN:VB. The effect of these interactions is further studied through Bader charge analysis, which reveals that electrical charges transfer from the MA to BN:VB. For instance, in the case of 4Li@BN:VB, the Li atoms transfer 0.52 e/Li to BN:VB. Similarly, in 4Na@BN:VB and 4K@BN:VB, 0.54 e/Na and 0.60 e/K are transferred to BN:VB, respectively. This quantitative charge transfer analysis implies that Li, Na, and K dopants act as charge donors, while BN:VB serves as a charge acceptor. The significant charge transfer results in strong binding interactions", "page": 8, "position": 0}

A metallic anode provides high electronic conductivity, which is essential for efficient charge transport during battery operation. Moreover, the substantial charge transfers transform the MA into cations, which facilitate appropriate 𝐸𝑎𝑑𝑠 of H2 molecules.

A strong covalent feature is found for B–N and N–N bonds, as indicated by the ELF value of 0.94 in Figure 6. However, the ELF values decrease to zero at the center of the pores, especially the larger pore, implying a low electron distribution. This is crucial for diffusion channel formation and MA adsorption. 3.3 MIBs anodes using nMA@BN:VB 3.3.1 Theoretical specific capacity and open-circuit voltage The assessment of specific capacity and open-circuit voltage (OCV) holds significant importance in evaluating the electrochemical behavior of electrodes in MIBs [62]. To model the electrochemical process and ascertain the maximum specific capacity, we have systematically introduced Li, Na, and K atoms to BN:VB, incrementally adding four MA (i.e., 1 layer) at a time. The average 𝐸𝑏𝑖𝑛𝑑 surpassing the 𝐸𝑐𝑜ℎ is considered as an indication for the further adsorption of MA. It is evident that MA exhibited unique adsorption characteristics attributable to their diverse atomic sizes and 𝐸𝑏𝑖𝑛𝑑. Owing to its high surface-to-volume ratio, the BN:VB could host up to 44 Li, 28 Na, and 20 K. The average 𝐸𝑏𝑖𝑛𝑑 are 1.80, 1.36, and 1.26 eV per Li, Na, and K, respectively, as shown in Figure 7(a). It is crucial to note that the structure will exhibit symmetry breaking upon reaching the maximum specific capacity, hence allowing orbitals mixing as shown in Figure 3(ii). Next, the theoretical specific capacities are determined using equation (2). The Li, Na, and K specific capacities of BN:VB anode are calculated as 1821.53, 786.11, and 490.51 mA hg-1, comfortably exceeding that of BSi (1374 mAhg-1 for Li) [63], graphite (372 mAhg-1 for Li) [64], 2D PC3 (1200 mAhg-1 for Li) [65] , Zn0.8Mn0.2O (312.4 mAhg-1 for Na) [66], V2N MXenes (952 mAhg-1 and 463 mA h/g for Na) [67], T‑NiSe2 (247.0 mAhg-1 for K) [68],", "page": 9, "position": 0}

These optimal OCV values are desirable for efficient anode materials to prevent dendrite formation during cycling and safeguard MIBs from short lifespan and breakdown. 3.3.2 Diffusion barriers To further assess the dynamics of MA on the surface of BN:VB, we have computed the diffusion energy barriers for the movement of MA from the most stable position to a neighboring equivalent position. Strong 𝐸𝑏𝑖𝑛𝑑 values in the cases of single Li, Na, and K adsorption suggest significantly high diffusion barriers. This assumption is further corroborated by the diffusion barrier calculations presented in Figure 8. The diffusion barriers for Li-, Na-, and K@BN:VB are found as 0.93, 0.63, and 2.11", "page": 9, "position": 1}

Furthermore, we have investigated how the diffusion barriers for Li, Na, and K change with different loading levels inside the same pore. Figure 8 clearly shows that the diffusion barriers decrease with increasing loading. Namely, (a) in the case of Li@BN:VB, when the pore is partially occupied by one Li atom, the barrier for the second Li atom reduces to 0.79 eV. It further decreases when the loading is increased to two Li atoms, with the third Li atom requiring only 0.47 eV to move to the second most stable position. (b) For Na@BN:VB, a more rapid diffusion is observed as compared to Li. The first Na needs to overcome a diffusion barrier of 0.63 eV, which is reduced to 0.31 eV when another Na atom is placed in the pore, increasing the likelihood of hopping to another position. The diffusion barrier of Na atoms continues to decrease with increasing loading concentration, reaching a very low value of 0.08 eV for the third Na atom to diffuse when the pore is loaded with two Na atoms. (c) Lastly, for the case of K@BN:VB, K shows the weakest diffusion characteristics compared to the Li and Na. This can be explained by the strong bonding exhibited by the K atom, as shown in the ELF plot in Figure 6. The high diffusion barrier of 2.11 eV for a single K atom is reduced to 0.60 eV for the fourth K atom when the pore is occupied by three K atoms. Our findings indicate that increasing the loading of MA in the pore significantly lowers the diffusion barriers for Li, Na, and K. This behavior suggests that higher concentrations of MA could facilitate faster atom mobility within the battery material, potentially improving the charge and discharge rates. Na atoms in particular show the most favorable diffusion characteristics, making BN:VB a promising anode material for NIBs. 3.4 H2 storage using 4MA@BN:VB The other important aim of this work is to evaluate the potential of BN:VB as efficient H2 storage material.

Na atoms in particular show the most favorable diffusion characteristics, making BN:VB a promising anode material for NIBs. 3.4 H2 storage using 4MA@BN:VB The other important aim of this work is to evaluate the potential of BN:VB as efficient H2 storage material. First, the adsorption of a single H2 molecule on Pr-BN and BN:VB is evaluated without MA decoration. We have carried out relaxation of a single H2 molecule at various adsorption sites on the primitive cell of the two systems. All the adsorption processes lead to physisorption, with maximum 𝐸𝑎𝑑𝑠 and minimum adsorption distance shown in Table 3. The maximum 𝐸𝑎𝑑𝑠 are -0.15 and -0.16 eV for Pr-BN and BN:VB, with a minimum distance of 2.97 Å and 2.57 Å, respectively. Accordingly, we used 4MA@BN:VB to enhance the H2 adsorption. The goal is to achieve high H2 𝐸𝑎𝑑𝑠 within the range of range [-0.15, -0.60] eV set by the US-DOE. The MA on BN:VB are expected to introduce changes to the lattice bonding and contribute to forming electric dipole moments that make the substrate even more polar. The enhancement in the surface polarity could induce dipole moments to the H2 molecules. 3.4.1 Hydrogenation of 4MA@BN:VB Subsequently, we have evaluated the H2 storage capacities of the 4MA@BN:VB. The H2 adsorption is carried out in a stepwise manner, starting with introducing a single H2 molecule to each MA (4H2 on", "page": 10, "position": 1}

Next, the number of H2 molecules are increased one by one up to six per MA on 4MA@BN:VB, and structural relaxations are performed in each case. Our results suggest that 4Li-, 4Na-, and 4K@BN:VB can adsorb up to 20, 24, and 24H2 molecules, respectively. Figure 9 presents the optimized atomic structures with the maximum number of H2 molecules adsorbed on the 4MA@BN:VB systems. The 𝐸𝑎𝑑𝑠 values per H2 are calculated using equation (4). In Figure 10(a), the absolute values of the corresponding average H2 adsorption energies are presented, demonstrating improvement in 𝐸𝑎𝑑𝑠 compared to the case of BN:VB with -0.16 eV for a single H2 molecule. These H2 molecules on 4MA@BN:VB are physiosorbed via the predominant electrostatic and van der Waals-type interactions, and the average 𝐸𝑎𝑑𝑠 values are -0.198, -0.215, and -0.192 eV for a maximum hydrogenation (i.e., 20H2, 24H2, and 24H2 adsorbed on 4Li-, 4Na-, and 4K@BN:VB, respectively). Next, the theoretical H2 gravimetric capacities (CT) are calculated based on the maximum number of H2 molecules (NT), according to equation (5) with data shown in Table 4. All atomic weights are sourced from the database [70]. The calculated gravimetric capacities are 10.64, 10.72, and 9.38 wt%, corresponding to 4Li-, 4Na-, and 4K@BN:VB, respectively, as shown in Figure 10(b). Since DFT utilizes the Born-Oppenheimer frozen lattice approximation and runs all calculations at 0 K, these theoretical capacities exclude the essential thermodynamic contributions of finite pressure and temperature. The adjusted values under the ambient conditions should be calculated using the thermodynamic analysis which will be discussed next. 3.4.2 Thermodynamic analysis It is important to realize the effective H2 storage capacity of the proposed materials at ambient conditions of temperature (T) and pressure (P). Therefore, we performed statistical thermodynamic analysis based on the Langmuir adsorption model [71-73]. Based on equations (6-8), Figure 11 shows the number of H2 molecules (N) adsorbed on 4MA@ BN:VB at given P and T values. The N-P-T analysis indicates that H2 molecules can be stored in the storage material at low-T and high-P conditions, then released under high-T and low-P", "page": 11, "position": 0}

The computational methods used in each study are highlighted. Overall, our theoretical gravimetric capacities of 4MA@BN:VB are higher than most of the reported materials. It should be emphasized that in the few studies with higher gravimetric capacities, the authors carried out the hydrogenation to much lower thresholds of average adsorption energies. Thus, the 4MA@BN:VB systems can surpass their counterparts by accommodating more H2 molecules if the threshold of average 𝐸𝑎𝑑𝑠 reduced than the currently considered (i.e., |𝐸𝑎𝑑𝑠 𝑐𝑟𝑖𝑡|< 0.16 eV). Based on our findings, it is thus conclusive that 4MA@ BN:VB are promising materials for H2 storage applications. 4. Conclusion In this study, we reported vacancy induced boron nitride monolayers (BN:VB) as multifunctional materials, which could be used as anodes for MIBs and H2 storage applications. Based on comprehensive theoretical approaches, such as DFT, AIMD, and thermodynamic analysis, we studied the structural, electronic, and MA decorations on the surface of BN:VB. Our findings revealed that the presence of a pore in BN:VB induces robust ionic bonds with MA. The thermal stabilities of 4MA@BN:VB (MA= Li, Na, K) systems are confirmed through AIMD at 400K. The electronic properties calculation through spin-polarized PDOS, band structure, and Bader charge analysis show significant charge transfer from the MA to BN:VB, improving the electrical conductivity. For MIBs anodes, important parameters of MA@BN:VB, such as specific capacities, electronic characteristics, diffusion barriers, and open-circuit voltage (OCVs), are explored. The theoretical specific capacities of 1821.53, 786.11 and 490.51 mA hg-1 are calculated for Li, Na, and K, respectively. Strong electrochemical stabilities are validated by average OCVs of 0.15, 0.25, and 0.32 V for Li, Na, and K, respectively. Diffusion analysis showed lower barriers with increased atom loading, especially in the Na system. For H2 storage applications, 4Li-, 4Na-, and 4K@BN:VB adsorbed multiple H2 molecules, reaching to significantly gravimetric densities of 10.64, 10.72, and 9.38 wt%, respectively. These values comfortably exceeded the US-DOE target of 5.5 wt%. Average adsorption energies per H2 on the studied systems", "page": 12, "position": 0}
