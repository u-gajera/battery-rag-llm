We show that NaO2 exhibits a large degree of rotational and magnetic disorder; a 3-body Ising Model is necessary to capture the subtle interplay of this disorder. MC simulations demonstrate that energetically favorable, FM phases near room temperature consist of alternating bands of orthogonally-oriented O2 dimers. We ﬁnd that bulk structures are insulating, with a subset of FM structures showing a moderate gap (< 2 eV) in one spin channel.

The roles of nucleation,29,31,32 nanoscale stabilization,23 and surface energetics of various sodium- oxygen compounds have been examined through a com- bination of density functional theory (DFT) calcula- tions and electrochemical measurements. This has led to an improved understanding of Na-O2 battery reac- tions, which, as proposed, constitute a combination of surface and solution mechanisms of the NaO2 discharge product.2,33 In certain cases, it should be noted, Na2O2 has been reported as the discharge product,34,35 and se- lectivity between NaO2 and Na2O2 is not yet fully char- acterized.

Alkali superoxides are known to be highly disordered materials, both in geometric structure and magnetic ordering.36,37 Presently, there is very limited understand- ing of geometric and magnetic disorder in NaO2, due to challenges in experimentally synthesizing NaO2. It is cru- cial to map out disorder in room-temperature NaO2, con- sidering its importance in determining electronic struc- ture, surface energetics, and growth properties, relevant for Na-O2 batteries. In this work, we aim to ﬁll the gaps in the current understanding of the electronic structure of NaO2. We perform DFT calculations incorporating the Hubbard U correction and use that to understand the geometric and magnetic disorder in NaO2. We em- ploy an Ising model accounting for magnetic and geo- metric degrees of freedom and ﬁnd that both 2-body and 3-body nearest-neighbor interactions, which take into ac- count both the geometric and magnetic disorder of the structure, are critical to accurately describe bulk NaO2. The Ising model is used within a metropolis monte carlo framework to characterize the complete phase space as a function of temperature. In order to determine the eﬀect of disorder on the electronic properties of NaO2, we employ hybrid density functional theory calculations and ﬁnd that the calculated bandgap is strongly aﬀected by disorder. All investigated structures exhibit a direct bandgap around 4 eV, with the exception of a small sub- set of ferromagnetic structures, whose direct bandgap is below 2 eV in one spin channel. The discharge process of the Na-O2 battery involves the Na+ ion coupled electron transfer reaction with O2 at the cathode, which produces NaO2, the primary reported discharge product.21,22 Na+ + O2 + e−⇌NaO2(s) (1) A few studies do report the formation of Na2O2,34 which is the thermodynamically", "page": 0, "position": 1}

The stable phase of bulk NaO2 itself is also temperature-dependent.23,38–40 Below 196 K, NaO2 takes the Pnnm space group. Between 196 and 223 K, NaO2 takes the Pa¯3 space group. Above 223 K, NaO2 takes the Fm¯3m space group, the primary relevant structure for room-temperature Na-O2 batteries. To explore the reaction mechanism of the Na-O2 bat- tery, we need to understand the bulk composition of NaO2 and accurately describe its electronic structure and dependent properties. The oxygen dimer in NaO2 be- haves similar to the superoxide anion, O− 2 .41 Within the molecular orbital picture of ground-state (triplet) O2, the 2 highest occupied orbitals are the π∗ 2p antibonding or- bitals, with one electron in each orbital, following Hund’s Rule of Maximum Multiplicity.42 The highest occupied arXiv:1702.05520v1 [cond-mat.mtrl-sci] 17 Feb 2017", "page": 0, "position": 2}

This means that the O− 2 dimer has 1 unpaired electron, making O− 2 magentic. The magnetic ordering of these spins is one of the key contributions to the conﬁgurational disorder of bulk NaO2. We considered bulk NaO2 in the Fm¯3m space group structure. In this structure, sodium occupies the body centers and corners of the cubic cell, and oxygen dimers occupy face centers and edge centers of the cell, as illus- trated in the appendix. We introduce the following nam- ing scheme for these structures to describe both their geometric and magnetic arrangement. The ﬁrst 4 let- ters, which can be A, B, C, or D, refer to the 4 possible geometric orientations of oxygen dimers. The next 4 let- ters, which can be P or N, refer to the net positive or negative magnetic moment of the corresponding dimers. Thus, a structure designated AAAA-PPPP has all dimers mutually parallel to each other (AAAA), and all dimers of identical, positive magnetization (PPPP), providing a ferromagnetic structure. Alternatively, a structure desig- nated ABCD has all dimers mutually orthogonal to each other, while a structure designated PNPN or PPNN is antiferromagnetic. Formation enthalpies were calculated for 19 possible structures to explore the phase space of bulk NaO2. Self-consistent DFT calculations were performed using the Projector Augmented Wave Method as implemented in GPAW,43 with the Revised PBE (RPBE) exchange correlation functional.44 To correct electron localization in NaO2, we incorporated the Hubbard U, applied on oxygen 2p states in NaO2.45–49 Calculations were run with a real-space grid of 0.18 ˚A, and 6×6×6 k-point sam- pling, following the Monkhorst-Pack scheme.50 Fermi- Dirac smearing of 0.01 eV was used to facilitate conver- gence and broyden-type mixing of electron densities was used in the calculation.51,52 Two schemes were used to calculate formation en- thalpy of bulk NaO2.

The formation enthalpy of NaO2 is given by: ∆HFNaO2 = EDFT NaO2 −ERef Na −ERef O2 + ∆pV (2) The pressure-volume work term, ∆pV, can be disre- garded, as it is typically about 5 orders of magnitude smaller than internal energy contributions in formation enthalpy calculations.53,54 Internal energies of Na, O2, and NaO2 were calculated using DFT simulations. It is well known that molecular oxygen is poorly de- scribed in DFT.55 The energy of O2 can be more accu- rately calculated using water as the reference molecule.56 In the ﬁrst scheme used, reference energy of O2 was com- puted using the DFT-calculated internal energies of H2O and gaseous H2, as well as the experimental formation enthalpy of H2O: ERef O2 = 2EDFT H2O −2EDFT H2 −∆HExp H2O (3) The Hubbard U correction was applied on the oxygen atoms in both H2O and NaO2. The second scheme was used to calculate reference en- ergy of bulk Na. It was demonstrated in prior work that formation enthalpies of alkali oxides, peroxides and su- peroxides are best described when the oxidation state of the metal in the reference compound is matched to the oxidation state of the metal in the compound under investigation.57 Following this scheme, the Na reference energy was calculated using the calculated internal ener- gies of NaCl and gaseous Cl2, as well as the experimental formation enthalpy of NaCl: ENaRef = ENaClDFT −1 2EDFT Cl2 −∆HNaClExp (4) Currently, there is no universally accepted method for selecting the optimal Hubbard U to ﬁt calcula- tions to experimental data.

The fully-organized, ferromag- netic (AAAA-PPPP) and fully disorganized, antiferro- magnetic (ABCD-PPNN) structures were found to be least energetically stable, while the moderately disorga- nized structures with intermediate magnetic order, such as AABB-PPPN, were most stable. Many of these mod- erately disorganized structures were energetically degen- erate at all examined values of the Hubbard U. We ob- serve that U = 3 eV is matches the experimental for- mation energy and will be used for further analysis. It is also worth highlighting that the conclusions regarding disorder in bulk NaO2 remain consistent for all examined values of the Hubbard U. Given the high degeneracy observed among examined structures of NaO2, it becomes crucial to examine the role of thermal disorder and its role in determining elec- tronic properties of NaO2. The computation of disorder in larger supercells directly through DFT is computation- ally intractable. We employ the approach of determining a lattice Hamiltonian60 that can be used to describe the energetics of bulk NaO2. In order to map out energetic interactions between the magnetic and geometric degrees of freedom, we utilize a modiﬁed Ising Model for the lattice Hamiltonian. As im- plemented, the model consists of a lattice of N sites i, whose ﬁlling is described by occupation terms, σi. Sys- tem energy contributions due to particle interactions in neighboring sites are captured by the 2-body and 3-body interaction terms, j2i,k and j3i,k,l. The total energy of the N-site lattice is calculated as: E = − X ⟨ik⟩ j2i,kσiσk − X ⟨ikl⟩ j3i,k,lσiσkσl (5) Formation enthalpies of NaO2 calculated by DFT sim- ulations were", "page": 1, "position": 2}

Formation enthalpy data at each value of the Hubbard U was used to derive a set of corresponding in- teraction coeﬃcients, though a least-squares regression ﬁt. The sole diﬀerences among the structures lay in the relative geometric and magnetic arrangement of the oxygen dimers, and these diﬀerences are reﬂected in the nearest-neighbor interaction terms j. A total of 4 dif- ferent types of j2i,k terms are identiﬁed, along with 6 diﬀerent types of j3i,k,l terms. Our naming scheme re- lies on comparison of dimers, e.g. j2AAP P , corresponds to the interaction between 2 dimers of parallel geometry and identical magnetization, while j2ABP N, corresponds to the interaction between 2 dimers of orthogonal geom- etry and opposite magnetization. Likewise, j3AAAP P P , corresponds to the interaction among 3 dimers of mu- tually parallel orientation and mutually identical mag- netic moment, while j3ABCP P N corresponds to the in- teraction among 3 oxygen dimers of mutually orthogonal orientation, where 2 dimers share an identical magneti- zation that diﬀers from that of the third dimer. The plot of ﬁtted interaction coeﬃcients is shown in Fig. 1(b). The plot demonstrates that among the 2-body interac- tion terms, j2AAP N was most energetically stabilizing, while among the 3-body interaction terms, j3AABP P P was most energetically stabilizing. Our DFT calculations suggested that the most ther- modynamically stable conﬁgurations correspond to bulk structures of intermediate disorder, both in geometric and magnetic arrangement (e.g. AABB-PPPN). Sub- sequent Ising Model calculations supported this obser- vation, with j2AAP P the most-stabilizing 2-body interac- tion term, and j3AABP P P the most-stabilizing 3-body in- teraction term. It should be noted that using a purely 2- body Ising Model of NaO2 ﬁnds that the most-stabilizing nearest-neighbor interaction term was j2ABP N, imply- ing that the fully-disorganized antiferromagnetic struc- ture (e.g. ABCD-PNPN) would be the predominant en- ergetically stable structure.

Interaction coeﬃcients j derived from the Ising Model were used in Metropolis-Hastings Monte Carlo (MHMC) simulations, to characterize larger bulk cells with higher degree of disorder, at ﬁnite temperature. Supercell structures were constructed as N×N×N arrays of cu- bic unit cells of Na4O8, the structures studied in DFT simulations. Simulations were run for supercells of size 4 to 7, to study convergence of bulk properties as the overall simulated system size increases. Peri- odic boundary conditions in all directions were imple- mented and the systems were studied using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo Method,61,62 modiﬁed with the Metropolis-Hastings Algorithm.63 Interaction coeﬃcients corresponding to a Hubbard U correction of 3 eV were used with the MHMC simulations, to most closely match the experimental formation enthalpy of NaO2. The re- sults would remain qualitatively consistent for other val- ues of U, and there would be a minor change in the ob- served phase transition temperatures. At the initialization of each MHMC simulation, a fully- organized supercell bulk structure was set up, with all dimers identical (e.g. AAAA-PPPP). Each individual trial step consisted of switching a randomly selected O2 dimer in the bulk structure to one of the other available conﬁgurations; orientational or magnetic change. The eﬀect of this switch on system energy was calculated. The standard Metropolis Algorithm was used to decide whether to accept the trial step or not. At the end of every step, system formation enthalpy and entropy were recorded for further analysis. Conﬁgurational entropy was calculated as the loga- rithm of the number of conﬁgurations with the same pro- portions of oxygen dimers of diﬀerent types.

The conﬁgura- tional entropy is then simply calculated by Boltzmann’s Entropy Formula: SConf = kB log Ω. To explore high-temperature, high-energy phases of bulk NaO2, each system simulation was initially raised to a temperature of 1252 K. Once the energy of the structure was stabilized at the initial high temperature, the system was annealed64 in temperature steps of 0.25 K, down to 2 K. At each 50 K increment, formation enthalpy and con- ﬁgurational entropy data was collected for analysis. This scheme worked robustly and the thermodynamic quanti- ties converged for all supercell sizes investigated. MHMC simulations were used to determine eﬀect of temperature on the structural disorder and in turn the free energy of bulk NaO2, as shown in Fig. 1(c) and Fig. 1(d). When the temperature is high, most of the struc- tures could have become accessible, as the entropic term dominates. Thus, the structure at high temperature was predominantly fully-disordered, both in geometry and in magnetic moment as shown in Fig. 1(e). Around 650 K, the structure underwent a phase change, wherein the bulk NaO2 formed large, parallel planes of alternating geometry of O2 dimers, as depicted in Fig. 1(f). In this phase, the magnetic moment was still largely disor- dered, within and across the monolithic-geometry planes. Around 350 K, the bulk structure underwent a second phase change, where the magnetic moment of all dimers was locked in phase together and the geometry main- tained the alternating planar structure.

HSE06 has been shown to accurately capture bandgaps for various semi- conducting and insulating materials with mean abso- lute error (MAE) varying from 0.26−0.4 eV for diﬀerent classes.66–69 Bandgap values were calculated across all k- points and the minimum was reported for each phase of NaO2 for Hubbard U = 3-7 eV. We ﬁnd that there is an increase in bandgap with increasing U as shown in Table II in S.I. The widening of the bandgap with in- creasing U is due to enhanced localization of electrons in the π∗ 2p oxygen bands in NaO2. We also observe that the bandgap in both spin channels is identical for antiferro- magnetic structures, and markedly diﬀerent for ferromag- netic structures. This behavior is observed as the addi- tional electrons in O− 2 ions only occupy one spin channel. In the AFM structures, electrons are equally distributed in the spin channels, and the gap is between pairs of π∗ 2p states. In the FM structures, the bandgap in the occu- pied spin channel is between π∗ 2p and σ∗ 2p state and is thus higher than AFM; while for the other channel, it is between deeper π∗ 2p states and is thus lower than that in AFM. For mixed cases (e.g. PPPN), we expect the bandgap to be bounded by the AFM and FM cases, due to electron occupation of the π∗ 2p bands.

The system is expected to exhibit some degree of magnetic disorder even at room temperature. Our study on the electronic properties shows that NaO2 is a wide-bandgap insulator, with a bandgap around 4 eV and we expect it to have poor electrical conductivity at room-temperature. In the context of Na-O2 batteries, this implies that growth of the discharge product is most likely occurring due to the solution mechanism pathway involving a chemical dissolution of NaO2 into Na+ and O− 2 , similar to what is seen in Li-O2 batteries.

For all investigated structures, the Hubbard U correction was ramped in increments of 0.1 eV.3–7 All calculations were run with a real- space grid of 0.18 ˚A spacing, and a 6×6×6 k-point sampling, following the Monkhorst-Pack scheme.8 Fermi-Dirac smearing of 0.01 eV was used to facilitate convergence and ensure accuracy. The Poisson equation was solved with convergence tolerance of ϵ = 10−12, to ensure electron density is solved precisely, to improve convergence of the calculations. Broyden-type mixing of electron densities was used in the calculation, mixing 5 previous densities with weights of 5%.9 The spin densities were mixed separately10 and the calculations were converged to a force of < 0.01 eV/˚A. FIG. 1: Unit cell of Fm¯3m NaO2 used in the study. For calculations involving the electronic properties of NaO2, we used the HSE06 hybrid functional,11 which has been demonstrated to give accurate bandgap estimates for a broad range of materials.12 HSE06 is implemented in plane-wave (PW) mode in GPAW, so all structures were re-converged to the same accuracy as in the grid mode mentioned above. PW-mode calculations were ﬁrst run using PBE, then the HSE06 hybrid functional was applied to correct for the energy levels of various bands. The bandgap was converged with respect to the k-point sampling, PW energy cutoﬀ, and the Fermi-Dirac smearing.

(1) The pressure-volume work term, ∆pV , can be disregarded, as it was found to be 5 orders of magnitude lesser than internal energy contributions in formation enthalpy calculations.13,14 Internal energies for Na, O2, and NaO2 were calculated using DFT simulations. Several schemes were used to calculate reference energies for sodium and oxygen, as illustrated in Fig. 3. Initial calculations were run using direct DFT calculations for both the bulk Na reference internal energy and the gaseous O2 reference internal energy for NaO2 directly. This scheme is suﬃcient for the calculation of formation enthalpies of most compounds. ENaRef = ENaUDF T (2) EO2Ref = EO2UDF T (3) The scheme used the ground state of molecular oxygen: triplet oxygen, which has a non-zero net magnetic moment, since both of its highest-energy electrons, in the 2p π∗orbital, are spin-up electrons, occupying distinct orbitals, following the Pauli Exclusion Principle. The calculation was carried out with spin polarization enabled, with the two oxygen atoms preset to the same net magnetic moment of +1/2. In this conﬁguration, the energy of the oxygen was over-stabilized, and the calculated formation enthalpy was too high for all values of the Hubbard U, as compared to the experimental formation enthalpy. It is well-known that molecular oxygen is poorly described in DFT, and our ﬁrst two calculation schemes for the formation enthalpy of NaO2 were unable to match the experimental formation enthalpy using the DFT-calculated energy of O2 alone. The energy of oxygen can be more accurately calculated using water as the reference.15,16 In the ﬁrst scheme used, reference energy of oxygen was computed using the DFT-calculated internal energies of water and gaseous hydrogen, as well as the experimental formation enthalpy of water. This correction is given by: EO2Ref = 2EH2ODF T −2EH2DF T −∆HH2OExp (4) DFT-calculated sodium internal energy was used as the sodium reference in this scheme directly, i.e. ENaRef = ENaDF T .

The Hubbard U correction was applied on the oxygen atoms in H2O, to appropriately calculate formation enthalpy of NaO2 at corresponding values of the Hubbard U. Using this reference energy scheme, we were able to match the formation enthalpy of NaO2, at a Hubbard U value of approximately 5.5 eV. We also analyzed a second reference scheme, to correct for the reference energy of bulk Na. It was demonstrated in prior work that formation enthalpies of alkali oxides, peroxides and superoxides are best described when the oxidation state of the metal in the reference compound is matched to the oxidation state of the metal in the compound under investigation.17,18 Following this scheme, the Na reference energy was calculated using the simulated internal energies of NaCl and gaseous Cl2, as well as the experimental formation enthalpy of NaCl. The correction is given by: ENaRef = ENaClDF T −1 2ECl2DF T −∆HNaClExp (5) This scheme also made use of the water reference for oxygen energy, as described above.

Simulated formation enthapies are used to calculate relevant Ising Model coeﬃcients for the system. Through the use of coeﬃcients derived with the Ising Model, the new Hamiltonian can be implemented in a Monte Carlo simulation of larger bulk structures. These simulations introduce and allow the quantiﬁcation of the eﬀect of thermal disorder on the system. Coeﬃcients derived from the Ising Model were then used to simulate larger bulk cells with higher degree of disorder, to predict their formation enthalpies. In this model, we accounted for periodic boundary conditions in all directions to make our structure characteristic of a bulk material. Systems were studied using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo Method,20,21 modiﬁed with the Metropolis-Hastings Algorithm.22 Since our simulated NaO2 structures only included nearest-neighbor interactions, and no longer-range interactions, our Ising Model analysis likewise was limited only to nearest-neighbor interactions. We accounted for both two-body and three-body nearest-neighbor interactions. Derived nearest-neighbor j2:i,k and j3:i,k,l were used to calculate the full system formation enthalpy through the Ising model for these larger, bulk-like systems. At the beginning of the Monte Carlo simulation, a fully-organized initial supercell structure was set up. Each individual trial step taken in the Monte Carlo simulation consisted of switching a randomly selected O2 dimer in the bulk NaO2 structure to one of the other available conﬁgurations for that dimer. Before and after the switch, full system formation enthalpy was calculated using the 2- and 3-body Ising Model coeﬃcients derived earlier. To make the calculation eﬃcient, only nearest-neighbor interactions around the altered dimer itself were calculated, since the remainder of the system maintained the same net enthalpy before and after the trial step executed. The Metropolis Algorithm was used to decide whether to accept the trial step or not: 1. A uniformly distributed random real number ϵ was chosen, between 0 and 1 2.

If instead ϵ > β, the trial step was rejected and the system was reverted back to the earlier, reference structure. At the end of every trial step, the system formation enthalpy and entropy were recorded for further analysis. To explore high-temperature, high-energy phases of bulk NaO2, each simulation was initialized with a fully-organized supercell structure, composed of N x N x N cells of conﬁguration AAAA-PPPP. Initial system temperature used in the Metropolis-Hastings scheme was raised to 1252 K, to examine if the simulated bulk material would maintain long- range orientational or magnetic order at high temperature. The structure was simulated at 1252 Kelvin for a number of steps Nst suﬃcient to reach and maintain stable system energy. The required Nst was scaled with the supercell size N, as Nst = 15000 ∗(N/3)2. Once the energy of the structure was stabilized at the initial high temperature, the system was annealed23 in temperature steps of 0.25 K, down to 2 K. At each 50 K increment, the structure was held for an equivalent Nst, and both formation enthalpy and conﬁgurational entropy data was collected for analysis. This scheme worked robustly for the system studied, which contained between 256 and 1372 sites. Both entropy and formation enthalpy, per oxygen dimer contained, remained consistent for all supercell sizes investigated. The simulation was used to output data regarding the formation enthalpy of the bulk supercell, per formula unit, and the energy contribution by the conﬁgurational entropy of the bulk supercell (T ∗S), per formula unit, as recorded at the end of every trial step.
