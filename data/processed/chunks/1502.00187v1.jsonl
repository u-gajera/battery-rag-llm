In this work, the “anode potential” of charge-neutral lithium-intercalated graphite (LiC6) with oxidized edge planes is computed as a function of Li-content (nLi) at edge planes, using ab initio molecular dy- namics (AIMD), a previously introduced Li+ transfer free energy method, and the experimental Li+/Li(s) value as reference. The voltage assignments are corroborated using explicit electron transfer from ﬂuoroethylene carbonate radical anion markers. PF− 6 is shown to decompose electro- chemically (i.e., not just thermally) at low potentials imposed by our voltage calibration technique. We demonstrate that excess electrons reside in localized states-in-the-gap in the organic carbonate liquid region, which is not semiconductor-like (band-state-like) as widely assumed in the literature. keywords: lithium ion batteries; voltage prediction; density functional theory; ab initio molecule dynamics; computational electrochemistry 1", "page": 0, "position": 0}

Li+ insertion into graphite anodes to form LiC6 is completed at 0.1 V vs. Li+/Li(s), or ∼−2.9 V vs. standard hydrogen potential. Before this low voltage is reached, commonly used battery electrolytes containing ethylene carbonate (EC), cosolvents, and Li+/PF− 6 salt already decompose at 0.7-0.8 V vs. Li+/Li(s). Fortunately, the growth of self-limiting ﬁlms (called “solid-electrolyte interphase,” or SEI) formed via electron-injection- induced sacriﬁcial electrolyte degradation passivates and stabilizes the anode.1,2 SEI con- siderations are also relevant for new anode materials like silicon. To intepret measurements and to help devise better artiﬁcial SEI/passivation layers,3 there is a need to use electronic structure computational tools (e.g., Density Functional Theory, DFT) to predict the voltage dependence of liquid-solid interfacial processes. Such a capability will have signiﬁcant im- pact for studying not just LIB,4,5 but also lithium-air batteries,6 water-splitting processes,7,8 and broad areas relevant to fuel cells, catalysis,9–12 and electrodeposition.13,14 In this work, we validate a recently devised potential calibration scheme,15 apply it to interfaces between liquid EC and oxidized edge planes of LiC6, and explore the possibility of electrochemical decomposition of the counter-ion (PF− 6 ) used in commercial LIB electrolytes. In the elec- tronic supporting information (S.I.), we document the signiﬁcant error that can arise if the liquid electolyte is omitted in voltage estimates at interfaces. For non-redox active systems like non-Faradaic supercapacitors, the voltage diﬀerence be- tween two electrodes arises from their diﬀerent surface charges mediated by electric double layers in the liquid regino.16 In contrast, on complex LIB electrode surfaces, what a certain “applied voltage” means at the atomic level has not been suﬃciently conceptualized, partly due to the diﬃculty in probing details at such lengthscales.17 On the theory side, potential calibration has been challenging in periodic boundary conditions, condensed-phase DFT sim- ulations that depict liquid-solid interfaces.8–12 DFT calculations are performed at constant number of electrons, not constant voltage. Each DFT simulation cell is associated with one electrode/Fermi level and is incompatible with a second reference electrode.

Purely condensed phase simulations with no vacuum region require other methods. We recently estimated what will be called the “anode potential” (V) of inert LiC6 basal planes at ﬁnite temperature.15 The justiﬁcation is brieﬂy and heuristically described here. Our approach seeks to mimic LIB experimental processes, where Li-deintercalation occurs via transfer of Li+ from LiC6, through the liquid-solid interface, to the liquid electrolyte, and ultimately into the Li metal counter electrode not explicitly depicted in the simulation. e−ﬂows in the same direction, but through the external circuit. Experimentally, it is known that these charge transfer processes occur at the onset potential of 0.1 V vs. Li+/Li(s). We model this half-cell reaction at the onset of LiC6 delithiation, (LiC6)n →(Li(1−1/n)C6)− n + Li+(solv). (1) While our model does not include counter electrodes, and the excess e−is left on the anode in the simulation (with ﬁnite surface area correction, see below), Eq. 1 has eﬀectively completed the e−circuit. This is because, at equilibrium and in the absence of load-induced voltage drop, the Fermi level (EF) of the Li metal “counter electrode” in our thought experiment must be lowered by 0.1 V to coincide with the EF of LiC6. Under these conditions, the excess e−on Li1−δC6 can start to ﬂow to Li(s). By reaching equilibrium (tuning the free energy change (∆Gt) of the Eq. 1 to zero) via varying the surface charge (σ) on the electrode surface, we arrive at the experimentally known half-cell voltage for this reaction. This is the reference point that can be pegged to measurements. Away from this V=0.1 V vs. Li+/Li(s) ﬁxed point, anode voltages are clearly related to the free energy of monovalent Li+ transfer between LiC6 and EC liquid (∆Gt), ∆V = −∆Gt/|e|, provided that the interior Li atoms are frozen and not allowed to leak into the electrolyte (i.e., there is no redox reaction), which is the case in our simulations.15 The σ-V relationship associated with our frozen-Li basal plane", "page": 2, "position": 0}

The present work focuses on LiC6 edge planes through which Li+ can intercalate and deintercalate. Edge planes are far more technologically relevant and complex than the proof- of-principle pristine basal plane considered previously.15 But the same theoretical method can be used to examine the edge plane voltage. Indeed, Ref. 15 (Fig. 2) implies that this Li+ transfer protocol can in priciple directly compare the voltage on any two electrodes. This is because a suﬃciently thick liquid electrolyte region intervening between a basal and an edge plane can chemically and electrostatically screen them from each other. So the diﬀerence in equilibrium free energies of Li+ transfer from each electrodes to the electrolyte, divided by |e| should be proportional to their voltage diﬀerence. Since LiC6 is an electronic conductor, at equilibrium e−ﬂows between surfaces to make the voltage the same on basal and edge planes. On pristine edge planes, the all-important ∆Gt=0 point is determined not only by the electronic charge (σ) compensated by mobile Li+ in the liquid electrolyte, but also the fraction of Li occupying the edge sites (nLi). At a ﬁxed, applied potential, these two quantities should adjust themselves to minimize the free energy of the system. For the illustrative purpose of this work, we have ﬁxed σ=0 and only varied nLi, and V can be considered the instantaneous voltage before the edge Li+ content can change. Our predicted edge plane voltage as nLi varies will be corroborated using explicit electron transfer from ﬂuoroethylene carbonate radical anion markers. Using AIMD simulations with appropriately calibrated potentials, PF− 6 is shown to exhibit concerted e−transfer and bond- breaking reactions at low voltages, suggesting that under such conditions electrochemical decomposition may need to be considered. This is signiﬁcant because it is widely accepted that PF− 6 decomposes only thermally or due to reaction with trace water.19,20 Finally, the simulation cells used in this work provide information about the electronic orbital alignment at explicit electrode/electrolyte interfaces.

II. METHOD Our simpliﬁed electrode model consists of a LiC6 strip with all C=O termination.22,23 Four neighboring C=O bonds form a pocket where Li+ can reside. The Li+ surface density (nLi) is unity if all such pockets are occupied. Figure 1 depicts the periodically replicated 29.74×14.97×15.06 ˚A3 interfacial simulation cell containing a LixC192O48 anode slab and 32 EC molecules. Interior atoms in the anode, with LiC6 stochiometry, are frozen while C, O, and Li atoms at the edges are allowed to move. nLi < 1 electrode conﬁgurations are obtained by randomly, and as uniformly as possible, removing Li atoms from the two LiC6 edge planes. AIMD trajectories and a two-point thermodynamic integration (T.I.) formula with correc- tions/extrapolations are used to compute ∆Gt (Table I).

Tritium masses are substituted for proton masses to permit 1 fs time steps. Compared to the previous work,15 the predicted ∆Gt is shifted by −0.17 V to correct the prior neglect of quantum nuclear eﬀect inside bulk LiC6 and the inadvertent use of T=450 K when adding translational and vibrational entropies to compare with experiments performed at T=300 K. The trajectories are initiated using Monte Carlo (MC) simulations in which anode atoms are frozen in DFT/PBE-optimized conﬁgurations. LIB salt concentration is typically 1.0 M, the static dielectric constant is large (Debye length ∼3 ˚A), and electrode surfaces should be screened from each other even in a small simulation cell. Electrical double layers should be well-equilibrated to the extent that the simple classical force ﬁelds used are accurate. More MC details are described in the S.I. III. RESULTS A. Controlling Potential at LiC6 Edge Planes Instead of mapping the entire two-dimensional potential V(nLi, σ), we focus on σ = 0. In Fig. 1a, the linearly extrapolated V(σ = 0, nLi) reaches the LiC6 experimental plateau voltage of 0.1 V vs. Li+/Li(s) at nLi∼0.69. If nLi>0.69, σ > 0 would be needed to raise V(σ, nLi) back to the green line and achieve the experimental potential associated with LiC6. This merely means that some of the edge Li must then be considered Li+ ions — not atoms — compensated with mobile PF− 6 further away in the electrolyte.27 Note that a “half-electron rule” vertical shift has been included to convert ∆Gt (Table I) to V(σ = 0, nLi) (Fig. 1a). T.I. calculations involve moving a Li+ from LiC6 to the middle of the solvent region of a charge-neutral simulation cell, leaving an e−behind. Along the T.I. path, an average of half an e−, or σ=−|e|/(4A), exists on the two electrode surfaces, where", "page": 5, "position": 0}

We inject one mobile Li+, compensating an excess e−on the electrode, and recompute ∆Gt (Table I, trajectories G-H). The simulation cells remain charge-neutral. ∆V is found to be −0.20 V (δσ/δV=17.8 µC/(cm2V )) after adding the one e−. This is smaller in magnitude than that in basal plane simulation cells.15 To undo this surface charging eﬀect, a +0.1 V correction is thus applied. The shift vanishes at large A, and represents an extrapolation to inﬁnite system size. We stress that experimentalists can impose a potential without knowing details about the surfaces, but DFT calculations work diﬀerently; σ and nLi need to be adjusted to arrive at the desired voltage. In the absence of the liquid electrolyte, the potential at zero surface charge is directly related to the work function of the electrode in vacuum. In the S.I., we report work functions and show that the potential in vacuum, predicted as a function of nLi, is signiﬁcantly modiﬁed by the inclusion of the liquid electrolyte in the main text. This observation dovetails with predictions that work functions of metals can vary by ∼1 V when their surfaces are covered with a monolayer of water12 or organic molecules.28 Although linear extrapolation is not expected to hold over the entire nLi range, V(nLi, σ = 0) appears to extrapolate to a value substantially below 0 V vs. Li+/Li(s) at nLi=1. Nega- tive potentials relative to Li+/Li(s) are below the operating conditions of LIB anodes. This strongly suggests that σ=0 and nLi=1 yield an overpotential for electrolyte decomposition. In the literature, C=O edge AIMD simulations have been reported at nLi=1 and σ=0, and EC molecules are found to decompose in picosecond via two diﬀerent 2-e−mechanisms, releasing CO and C2H4 gases, respectively.22 What are the potential dependences of these two competing processes? Recently, it has been predicted that the 2-e−CO-releasing route has a far lower reaction barrier than C2H4 generation in bulk liquid electrolyte regions.29 It is therefore unlikely that C2H4 should be a dominant 2-e−product unless there is an over-", "page": 6, "position": 0}

In contrast, FEC−is bent (Fig. 2d), with CC now sp3 hybridized. This leads to a large “reorganization energy” in the Marcus theory sense,31 discussed below.

To initiate AIMD simulations, we ﬁrst conduct MC using classical force ﬁelds (see the S.I.), then run AIMD for 1.0 ps while freezing all FEC−atoms, and ﬁnally remove FEC constraints at “t=0” of AIMD trajectories. The time evolution of R are shown in Fig. 2. The reduction potential of FEC in bulk liquid regions is predicted to be Φ=0.58 eV when it is not coordinated to Li+ (S.I.). If V(σ = 0, nLi)<Φ, the excess e−should stay on FEC−, ultimately leading to a second reduction of FEC−and rapid decomposition.30,32 In the opposite case, the excess e−should be transferred to the electrode. The S.I. shows that this expectation is always satisﬁed with diﬀerent initial conﬁgurations on less electrochemically active basal plane surfaces. At edge planes, this test is successful, but less than 100 % of the time. When V∼0.18 V (nLi=0.667), lower than Φ=0.58 V, FEC−persists in all trials until it absorbs a second e−and decomposes (Fig. 2a). This dovetails with our expectation. 9", "page": 8, "position": 0}

Given our statistical uncertainties, this 50/50 split in the outcome is reasonable. When Φ<V=0.98 V, FEC−should give up its excess e−. This is observed 3 out of 4 times (Fig. 2c). On the whole, Fig. 2 demonstrates that V calibrated using Li+ transfer also correctly governs e−transfer. The one glaring “error” at V=0.98 V is apparently due to overly rapid C-O bond breaking in FEC−predicted using the PBE functional. This occurs within 100 fs (arrow in Fig. 2c; the predicted MP2 barriers for breaking this bond in EC−and FEC−are consistent with slower reaction rates.29,30). Afterwards, the FEC−ring cannot be reformed in AIMD timescale even if the anode potential favors it. It is also worth pointing out that DFT/PBE allows unphysical splitting of an excess e−between the electrode and the redox center, artiﬁcially accelerating e−transfer rate,33 and may make Fig. 2 unduly sensitive to initial conﬁgurations. Instantaneous ﬂuctuations in the potential experienced by redox centers are physical and real, but e−transfer occurs over a ﬁnite timescale that partially averages out the ﬂuctuations. Despite this, the overall trend of V and Φ correspondence is correctly predicted: as V decreases, FEC−retains its excess e−more readily. C.

In panel (a) (V=0.56 V), the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) is localized on FEC−— reminiscent of a polaron in solid state physics — just below the Fermi level (EF). FEC−is found to decompose from this conﬁgura- tion. In panel (b), V =0.98 V, higher than Φ=0.58 V; the localized orbital resides above EF, and FEC−loses its excess e−rapidly in this trajectory.

The above discussion adopts the solid state physics language often used in the battery community. It is important and of great interest to reconcile our study with molecular electrochemistry terminology35 less often featured in battery studies. According to Mar- cus theory,31 e−injection into FEC is accompanied with reorganization (free) energies (λ). For FEC−, λ contains a large intramolecular component, and is not solely due to “outer shell” solvation eﬀects. The “polaronic shift” of the HOMO of FEC−, from above the liquid conduction band edge if FEC−were ﬂat, to within the liquid gap due to FEC−geometry change and dielectric solvation, is a non-trivial manifestation of this λ. Quantitatively, the vertical electron aﬃnity should be at a value λ above the molecular reduction potential Φ.36 Unfortuately, it is diﬃcult to compute λ in simulation cells with electrodes which are electron conductors. For example, the liquid electrolyte LUMO at frozen liquid geometry tend to reside above the Fermi level. As a result, injecting an e−to the system to calculate the vertical electron aﬃnity immediately populates the Fermi level of the electrode, not the the electrolyte, unless constrained DFT methods are used in the electrolyte region. In this sense, the systems considered in this work may diﬀer from electrodes with a signiﬁcant band gap, like TiO2.37 Thus all AIMD simulations in this work report adiabatic free energy changes and redox potentials, not vertical excitations that include λ. To estimate λ, we have applied a localized basis set and dielectric continuum approach similar to Ref. 29. We ﬁnd that the total λ for FEC is 3.2 eV. This is somewhat larger than that of the struc- turally similar EC.29 Our predicted λ can be compared with future optical measurements in organic solvents analogous to those in aqueous media.36 Incidentally, the wide separation between the localized excess e−orbital in FEC−and the liquid", "page": 10, "position": 0}

PF− 6 Electrochemical Reduction Finally, this potential-calibration technique is used to investigate possible PF− 6 reductive decompostion on anode surfaces as V varies. A recent AIMD study has predicted rapid reductive decomposition of PF− 6 into LiF and PFq− n fragments, n ≤4, at liquid EC/graphite edge interfaces.39 Seemingly consistent with this prediction, simple cluster-based calculations suggests that the LiPF6 “molecule” has a reduction potential of 1.46 V (S.I.), far above LiC6 potentials during battery charging. However, such a PF− 6 reduction signature has not been observed in cyclic voltametry. Experimentally, the SEI formed in LiPF6-based electrolytes is known to contain LiF from PF− 6 breakdown, but it has been widely accepted that PF− 6 decomposes thermally or due to reaction with trace water over a period of hours,19,20 not electrochemically in seconds. To reconcile these observations, we note that, unlike FEC reduction, e−transfer to PF− 6 occurs in concert with P-F bond breaking.

In Fig. 4, we apply AIMD potential-of-mean-force (∆W(R)) techniques to estimate the free energy barrier (∆G∗) of PF− 6 decomposition at two diﬀerent potentials. The trajectories include a PF− 6 pre-equilibrated at each graphite edge, charge-balanced by Li+ in the electrolyte. The 3-atom reaction coordinate is R′=|RP −RF|−|RLi −RF|; P, F, and Li atoms are chosen such that they are in position to react at t=0 ps. Increasing R′ is correlated with F−transfer from P to an edge Li. Umbrella sampling potentials of the form A(R′ −Ro)2/2 are enforced, where B=4 to 10 eV and Ro span the range between the reactant and the transition state. See the S.I. for details. Figure 4a shows that, at V=0.56 V (nLi=0.583), ∆G∗is at least 0.9 eV. As soon as one P-F bond breaks completely, e−is transferred, other F−’s detach from the P-atom spontaneously (Fig. 4d), and these irreversible steps render a quasi-equilibrium sampling of ∆W(R) in the barrier top region impossible. In contrast, at V=−0.21 V (nLi=0.75), the barrier appears not much higher than 0.2 eV. Fig. 4 indicates that PF− 6 electrochemical reduction may occur during the initial stage of SEI formation if the anode is at suﬃciently low potentials, although this process faces competition from solvent reductive decomposition. Conclusions In conclusion, we have calibrated the anode potential (V(σ = 0, nLi)) of lithium interca- lated graphite edge planes at zero surface electronic charge (σ=0) as a function of the edge Li content (nLi) by computing the free energy of Li+ transfer between electrode and liquid electrolyte. The estimated V is shown to be reasonable by correlating with observed electron transfer from reduced ﬂuoroethylene carbonate (FEC−) radical anions inserted into the liq- uid region. Electrochemical reduction of PF− 6 at the pristine edge plane is shown to be viable at low potentials and to exhibit potential-dependent kinetics. This reduction pathway may need to be considered during SEI formation, in addition to thermal/impurity water-induced PF− 6 decomposition routes widely accepted in the literature.

Fluorine Chemistry, 2005, 126, 27-31. 21 In the literature, the onset of SEI formation is often assumed to occur when the LUMO aligns with EF in all electrolytes. See, e.g., J.B. Goodenough and K.-S. Park, J. Am. Chem. Soc., 2013, 135, 1167-1176. 22 K. Leung and J.L. Budzien, Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys., 2010, 12, 6583-6586. 23 Edge C atoms are terminated in various functional groups. See R.L.

Burke and M. Ernzerhof, Phys. Rev. Lett., 1996, 77, 3865-3868. 27 We have used LiC6 inside the electrode throughout, instead of pure graphite at high voltage and LiC6 at low. The rationale is that the electrolyte does not see the electrode interior. See Ref. 22 for a discussion. 28 P.C. Rusu and G. Brocks, J. Phys. Chem. B, 2006, 110, 22628-22634. 29 K. Leung, Chem. Phys.

Marcus, Rev. Mod. Phys., 1993, 65, 599. 32 Organic carbonates have been shown to exhibit higher second reduction potentials than ﬁrst in high dielectric media, especially if they have broken bonds.29 33 P. Mori-S´anchez, A.J. Cohen and W. Yang, Phys. Rev. Lett., 2008, 100, 146401. 34 Although Kohn-Sham orbitals are not physical quantities in general and the above discussion is therefore qualitative, at the onset of FEC reduction, when the occupied FEC−HOMO orbital is at the Fermi level, the change of total electronic energy as a function of the partial occupancy of this orbital should indeed correspond to the orbital energy. In that sense Fig. 3 is well deﬁned at the onset of FEC reduction. 35 See, e.g., J.-M. Sa´eant, Chem. Rev. 2008, 108, 2348-2378. 36 C. Adriaanse, J. Cheng, V. Chau, M. Sulpizi, J. VandeVondele and M.
