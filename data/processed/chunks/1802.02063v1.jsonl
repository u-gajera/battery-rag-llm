Although, nitrogen-doped carbon nanotube (NCNT) arrays have been developed over recent decades through various advanced technologies are now capable of catalyzing ORR efficiently, their underdeveloped bifunctional property, hydrophobic surface, and detrimental preparation strategy are found to limit practical large-scale commercialization for effective rechargeable ZABs. Here, we have demonstrated fabrication of a three-dimensional (3D) nickel foam supported NCNT arrays with CoNi nanoparticles (NPs) encapsulated within the apical domain (denoted as CoNi@NCNT/NF) that exhibits excellent bifunctional catalytic performance toward both ORR (onset potential of 0.97 V vs. RHE) and OER (overpotential of 1.54 V vs. RHE at 10 mA cm-2). We further examined the practicability of this CoNi@NCNT/NF material being used as an air electrode for rechargeable ZAB coin cell and pouch cell systems. The ZAB coin cell showed a peak power density of 108 mW cm-2 with an energy density of 845 Wh kgZn-1 and robust rechargeability over 28h under ambient conditions, which exceeds the performance of PGM catalysts and leading non-PGM electrocatalysts. In addition, density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that the ORR and OER catalytic performance of the CoNi@NCNT/NF electrode are mainly derived from the d-orbitals from the CoNi NPs encapsulated within the apical dominant end of the NCNTs.

Thus, the use of highly efficient and stable electrocatalysts as air electrodes is of paramount significance for facilitating the sluggish ORR and OER, thereby attaining high power and long operating lifetime performance for ZABs. Typically, platinum group metals (PGM) are most favorable as ORR and OER catalysts displaying absolute superiority of catalytic activity. However, the high cost, poor stability/durability and low poison resistance of PGM have been the primary barriers that hamper widespread commercialization of ZABs.2, 6-9 With decades of extensive research in developing cost-effective catalysts that possess remarkable catalytic performance, a new generation of PGM-free electrocatalysts based on carbon materials such as heteroatom doped carbon nanotubes, graphene, and porous carbons have been studied. Most of these carbon catalysts exhibit comparable activity to PGM catalysts, which can be attributed to the heteroatom-introduced electron density redistribution of surface carbon atoms and an increase in pentagonal graphene edge defects. Among these, nitrogen-doped carbon nanotube (NCNT) arrays have previously shown impressive performance in fuel cells due to their favorable properties such as the in-situ growth of NCNT electrocatalyst on electrode substrate.5, 10-11 However, many well-developed NCNT arrays present with a hydrophobic surface characteristic that does not allow for O2, H2O, OH- and other ORR or OER intermediates to", "page": 2, "position": 0}

Additionally, the fabrication of carbon nanotube arrays are generally achieved through bottom-up processes by using transitional metal nanoparticles (NPs), mainly distributed at the base of NCNT arrays, as seeds for nanotube growth. This nano-architecture displaying hydrophobic properties at the carbon surface is unfavorable for fully accessible active sites being derived from carbon-encapsulated transition metals at the NCNT array base. Besides, neither the commonly used Si or Cu substrates are suitable for serving as an air electrode in ZABs, due to their air- impenetrability and easy corrosion in alkaline electrolyte.12-13 Thus, to further improve the performance of carbon nanotube arrays electrocatalysts in fuel cells will be a great challenge using the conventional synthesis strategy. Inspired by the mechanism of apical dominance in plant growth, where the shoot apex upward growth is crucial for better access to a light source, thus promoting more efficient photosynthesis when compared to lateral bud growth.14-15 Hence, according to plant physiology, it is conceivable that vertically grown NCNT arrays that present apically dominant active sites are better equipped to absorb O2, H2O, OH- and other associated reactants for a more immediate ORR or OER response, than compared with the base-grown NCNT arrays. For this reason, it is of great interest to rationally design a NCNT array electrode with enhanced catalytic activity at the NCNT apex. Herein, we have developed a highly efficient PGM-free catalyst comprised of three-dimensional (3D) nickel foam (NF) supported NCNT arrays in which CoNi alloy NPs were rationally implanted into the NCNT apex (the final product denotes CoNi@NCNT/NF). As a result, the as-prepared CoNi@NCNT/NF exhibited excellent catalytic performance toward both ORR and OER.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION The CoNi@NCNT/NF catalyst was synthesized through the following steps (Fig. S1): Firstly, a g-C3N4 layer acted as the carbon source for NCNTs growth, was polymerized and deposited on nickel foam by one step thermal treatment of melamine-covered nickel foam in air (referred to g- C3N4@NF, Fig. S1b); Then, Co3O4 nano-flakes were deposited on the g-C3N4@NF surface by repeatedly soaking g-C3N4@NF in cobalt nitrate solution and subsequent heat treatment in a muffle furnace under air atmosphere (denoted as Co3O4@g-C3N4@NF, Fig. S1d); Finally, after pyrolysis of Co3O4@g-C3N4@NF under nitrogen flow, NCNTs arrays were grown onto the nickel foam by following a “tip-growth” mechanism. More precisely, during heat treatment, the Ni atoms from nickel foam underwent diffusion and subsequent alloying with Co metal to form CoNi alloy NPs that served as catalytic seeds for NCNTs tip-growth. As a result, the NCNTs with CoNi NPs encapsulated within their apical domains were synthesized (denoted as CoNi@NCNT/NF, Fig. S1e). Scanning electron microscopic (SEM) images in Fig. 1a reveal a 3D structure of the nickel foam with open pathways for electrolyte and gas diffusion. A closer SEM observation in Fig. 1b shows vertical NCNT arrays are homogeneously grown on the surface of nickel foam. The corresponding SEM elemental mapping in Fig. S2 shows that C, N, O, Co and Ni elements uniformly exist within the skeleton of CoNi@NCNT/NF. Interestingly, as depicted in Fig. 1 c, the metal NPs (indicated by yellow circles) are only observed within the apex of each carbon nanotube. To further investigate the growth mechanism of CoNi@NCNT/NF, synthesis of the NCNT/NF without encapsulating CoNi NPs was completed for comparison. Elemental mapping of NCNT/NF indicate that the C, N, O and Ni elements are evenly distributed within the nickel", "page": 4, "position": 0}

This implies that the growth of the NCNT/NF follows a \"base-growth\" mechanism, further indicating the incorporation of Co compounds into the fabrication precursor plays a vital role in the apically dominant growth mechanism for CoNi@NCNT/NF. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image (Fig. 1d) of the CoNi@NCNT catalyst further confirms that metal NPs are encapsulated within the carbon nanotube apex. High- resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images in Fig. 1e show a well-defined graphite lattice spacing in the range of 0.42-0.54 nm (see Fig. 1f), which is larger than the typical lattice spacing of pristine graphite (0.34 nm). This can be attributed to the addition of nitrogen elemental dopants in the graphite layers, which increases the spacing of carbon layers.16 This is especially apparent for the carbon layers directly surrounding the metal NPs. The number of carbon layers surrounding the metal NP are also variant and highlighted in Fig. 1e and f as: 1- layer corresponding to the blue and red areas, 3-layer for the yellow area, and 6-layer for the purple area. This implies the metal NP has more effect on the most-outer carbon layer of tip section in NCNT than those of other places. Moreover, a lattice spacing of 0.2 nm is observed for the selected area in HRTEM image (Fig. 1e), which agrees well with the (111) crystal plane of CoNi alloy.17 TEM elemental mapping shows that N and C signals are uniformly distributed within carbon nanotubes, whereas Co and Ni signals are only detected at the black-contrast apical domains in the upper carbon nanotube sections. These findings suggest that nitrogen element is doped into the carbon nanotubes, and the metal NPs within the carbon nanotubes are comprised of Co and Ni elements.

Notably, the (002) diffraction peak of CoNi@NCNT/NF exhibits higher intensity and a smaller peak width at half height (FWHM) than that of NCNT/NF, indicating the high graphitization degree of CoNi@NCNT/NF.18 Concurrently, diffraction peaks of the CoNi@NCNT/NF are present at an approximate 0.5º lower than those of nickel metal (JCPDS: 04-0850) and NCNT/NF, indicating the CoNi alloy NPs are encapsulated within the NCNT arrays. Raman spectra of CoNi@NCNT/NF (Fig. S7) shows two prominent peaks at 1359 and 1587 cm-1, corresponding to D and G bands of NCNT, respectively. A higher ratio of D and G band intensities (ID/IG) indicates a more disordered carbon structure. In our case, the value of ID/IG for CoNi@NCNT/NF (0.99) is larger than that of NCNT/NF (0.90), suggesting more defects exist in the carbon layers on the surface near CoNi NPs. X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) for both CoNi@NCNT/NF and Ni@NCNT/NF are presented in Fig. S8. As expected, C, N, O and Ni elements are found in both samples, where a Co elemental signal was only detected in the CoNi@NCNT/NF sample. The mole ratio of Co to Ni was estimated to be 0.5 in the CoNi@NCNT/NF. The nitrogen dopants in NCNT can be deconvoluted into pyridinic nitrogen (Pyr-N) and graphitic nitrogen (Gra-N), corresponding to 3.2 at.% for Pyr-N and 5.8 at.% for Gra-N in CoNi@NCNT/NF (Fig. S9). In contrast, there are 4.2 at.% Pyr-N and 5.9 at.% Gra-N (Fig. S10) in NCNT/NF, which are slightly higher than those in CoNi@NCNT/NF. Meanwhile, previous reports suggested that both Pyr-N and Gra-N species can act as active sites for ORR and OER.19-20 Therefore, it may be expected that a higher catalytic activity would be observed on the NCNT/NF as compared to the CoNi@NCNT/NF. On contrary, the following electrochemical measurements performed in this work have demonstrated that the catalytic activity of CoNi@NCNT/NF was indeed higher than NCNT/NF.

A typical schematic diagram of the CoNi@NCNT/NF electrode is illustrated in Fig. 2a. We assume that the NCNTs are vertically grown from the NF surface, where much of the electrochemically relevant species have access to only the NCNT array apex, which can be attributed to the hydrophobic NCNT surface preventing molecular permeation. The implantation of CoNi NPs within the NCNT apical domains could promote catalytic efficiency of the surface active sites, thus accelerating ORR/OER processes on the CoNi@NCNT/NF electrode. For comparison, the schematic illustration in Fig. 2b shows a passive catalytic performance for NCNT/NF with scattered reactants (O2, OH- and H+ etc.) being absorbed on the NCNT surface. These reactants have limited access to the active sites for ORR and OER due to the hydrophobic characteristic of NCNT. To verify the previous assumptions, ORR and OER catalytic performance for both samples were first evaluated by steady-state linear sweep voltammograms (LSV) in 0.1 M KOH solution. Fig. 2c shows the CoNi@NCNT/NF electrode with an onset potential (Eonset) of 0.97 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) for ORR, which is more positive than those of Pt/C+RuO2/NF (Eonset = 0.91 V) and NiCNT/NF (Eonset = 0.81 V) electrodes. For OER catalytic performance, the overpotential at 10 mA cm-2 is measured to be E10 = 1.54 V vs. RHE for the CoNi@NCNT/NF electrode, outperforming Pt/C+RuO2/NF (E10 = 1.63 V), NCNT/NF (E10 = 1.59 V), NF (E10 = 1.71 V) electrodes and the other state-of-the-art catalysts (Supplementary Table 1).21-24 The NCNT arrays also provide the nickel foam with an increased, readily accessible active area, as", "page": 7, "position": 0}

This suggests that the higher active surface area of NCNT/NF and CoNi@NCNT/NF are a result from the modification of nickel foam with NCNT arrays, leading to effective promotion of electrochemically accessible surface. Stability is an important parameter for evaluating catalytic performance of electrocatalysts, the chronopotentiometry curves (Fig. 2d) show the stability of the CoNi@NCNT/NF electrode for ORR and OER, which is much higher than those of other electrodes in our study, with almost no decay of operating potential for either ORR or OER after 10h of operation at 10 mA cm-2. Interestingly, the OER overpotential for CoNi@NCNT/NF is shown to decrease after stability testing for 10h, which could be attributed to the formation of hydroxylated surface.25-26 In contrast, an increased overpotential is observed for both the NCNT/NF electrode and the Pt/C+RuO2/NF electrode after ORR/OER testing for 10h (Fig. 2e). Moreover, the potential difference between LSVs of ORR and OER at 10 mA cm-2 (∆E10) on the CoNi@NCNT/NF is decreased by 0.04 V after 10h operation, whereas increased ∆E10 values are observed with the NCNT/NF (∆E10 = 0.08 V) and Pt/C+RuO2/NF (∆E10 = 0.05 V) electrodes suggesting outstanding catalytic activity and stability for the CoNi@NCNT/NF electrode in ORR and OER. The same phenomenon can also be obtained through the amperometric (i-t) analysis (Fig. S12). To gain further insight into the effect of apical dominance on NCNTs, the catalytic contribution derived from the nickel foam should be ruled out. Therefore, the NCNTs from CoNi@NCNT/NF and NCNT/NF electrodes were individually stripped from nickel foam by sonication, and compared by cyclic voltammetry (CV) using rotating disk electrode (RDE) and rotating ring-disk electrode (RRDE) evaluations.

The observed oxygen reduction peak for CoNi@NCNT (0.87 V vs. RHE) is more positive than those of NCNT (0.71 V vs. RHE) and commercial Pt/C (0.83 V vs. RHE), suggesting the remarkable electrocatalytic activity of CoNi@NCNT for ORR. LSV curves in Fig. 3a confirm once again the superior ORR catalytic performance of CoNi@NCNT electrode with a positive onset potential (Eonset) at 0.97 V vs. RHE and a half-wave potential (E1/2) at 0.87 V vs. RHE. In contrast, those values of NCNT electrode (Eonset = 0.88 V and E1/2 = 0.70 V vs. RHE) and Pt/C electrode (Eonset = 0.94 V and E1/2 = 0.82 V vs. RHE) are much smaller than those of CoNi@NCNT, highlighting the enhanced ORR activity of CoNi@NCNT is attributed to the NCNTs being filled with CoNi NPs. In general, the electrical conductivity of electrocatalyst also plays a vital role in ORR performance. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS, Fig. S14) of the CoNi@NCNT electrode has a smaller semicircle than that of NCNT electrode, which implies a facilitated ORR process with the CoNi@NCNT electrode arising from the encapsulation of CoNi NPs into NCNTs. Interestingly, the CoNi@NCNT electrode also shows more stable catalytic activity with less ∆E1/2 attenuation (3 mV) than that of Pt/C electrode (32 mV) after 8000 cycles in 0.1 M KOH electrolyte. From the RDE voltammograms in Fig. 3b, it can be observed that the limiting current of CoNi@NCNT electrode increases with an increase in rotation speed (from 225 to 2025 rpm). The corresponding Koutecky-Levich (K-L) plots within the potential range from 0.55 to 0.75 V vs. RHE show a good linear relationship and similar slope to that of Pt/C. This suggests first order ORR reaction kinetics, which are related to oxygen concentration in the electrolyte and lead to a four-electron ORR pathway for the CoNi@NCNT electrode. The kinetic current for CoNi@NCNT (Jk = 26.3 mA cm-2) is extracted from the fitted K-L plot intercept at 0.65 V vs. RHE and is larger than that of Pt/C (Jk = 16.2 mA cm-2) and NCNT electrodes (Jk", "page": 9, "position": 0}

This describes a facilitated kinetics process for CoNi@NCNT showing an increase in Gibbs free energy (∆G) for ORR. Although, nitrogen content in CoNi@NCNT is lower than that of NCNT (Fig. S10), the encapsulation of CoNi NPs into the apical domain of the NCNTs could indeed optimize the accessibility of reactants to the active sites and therefore enhance catalytic activities of surface carbons as reflected by the above experimental observations. The ORR catalytic performance for CoNi@NCNT were also evaluated by RRDE measurements. The RRDE voltammograms in Fig. 3e show a larger disk current and more positive overpotential of CoNi@NCNT than those of Pt/C. Moreover, the ring current of CoNi@NCNT is as low as that of Pt/C. Concurrently, the electron transfer number (n) and HO2- yield for electrochemical reduction of oxygen can be calculated from ring and disk current (Fig. S15). The calculated values of n = 3.94 and HO2- yield = 7.8% for CoNi@NCNT are close to n = 3.96 and HO2- yield = 2% for the Pt/C electrode, implying a four-electron pathway with high selectivity toward ORR. Despite the CoNi@NCNT electrode performed well in the electro-reduction of oxygen, the actual active sites are still ambiguous since various active species that could be formed on the carbon surface during the pyrolysis, such as N-C, Metal-N/C and metal compounds such as carbides and oxides.6, 27 To ascertain the identity of the active sites, we studied the electrochemical performance of CoNi@NCNT under different detection experiments. As shown in Fig. 3f, compared with the LSV curve for a fresh CoNi@NCNT electrode (black line), no visible diminishment is detected on the CoNi@NCNT electrode after acid etching (red dashed line). This phenomenon suggests the carbides, oxides and other metal compounds are absent in the active sites of the CoNi@NCNT electrode.

One can see from Fig. 3f, the LSVs for CoNi@NCNT after adding 10 mM and 20 mM KSCN into 0.1 M KOH maintain the same feature to that of the original one, clarifying no Metal-N/C species exist in the active sites of CoNi@NCNT. Moreover, the CoNi@NCNT electrode also shows a strong tolerance to methanol crossover, as demonstrated by unnoticeable changes of current density in LSV curves after the addition of 1 M and 3 M methanol to the electrolyte (Fig. S16a). Whereas an obvious peak at 0.7 V vs. RHE appears in the Pt/C electrode LSV in 0.1 M KOH containing 1 M methanol solution, corresponding to the oxidation of methanol. Also, it is not a surprise that the CoNi@NCNT electrode has a superior OER activity than that of NCNT electrode, as evidenced by the LSV curves for OER in Fig. S17. These before mentioned results highlight good activity and stability of CoNi@NCNT ascribe to an optimal balance of surface active site density, nitrogen content and electron conductivity. In addition, we have computationally investigated the catalytic activity of the CoNi catalyst which was supported or encapsulated by NCNT i.e. CoNi@NCNT catalyst by calculating electronic properties of the CNT, NCNT and CoNi@NCNT systems; see Fig. 4. Our present calculations showed that there is a very small electron density appearing around the Fermi Energy (EF) level of the CNT although two bands overlapped and showed Dirac-point features like graphene,28 as shown in Fig. 4a. The Dirac point feature was lost in the band structure of the two wall CNT and two bands are just crossed the Fermi level resulting in less electron density around the EF as depicted in Fig. 4b. This calculation suggests that there is a repulsion between two layers in the two wall CNT, which is a feature that is also found in bilayer graphene.28 The interesting results were observed in the N-doped single wall CNT (i.e. NCNT), where doping caused a large change in the electronic properties of the NCNT.

To investigate the large electron density which appeared around the EF, we studied contribution of the d-subshell electron density of the CoNi catalyst which was encapsulated by NCNT. The DOSs of the d-subshell electrons of the individuals Co and Ni atoms were computed and plotted in the inset in Fig. 4d. The diagram suggest that the d-subshell electrons of the Ni atoms provide the major electron density around the Fermi level in the total density of states. Therefore, this is consistent with the d-subshell electron density of the Ni atoms plays an important role in improving the catalytic activity of the CoNi@NCNT and thus this catalyst enhances the catalytic performance for overall oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). To shed light on the ORR catalytic behaviors of, we further investigated the chemical reaction mechanism for the reaction on the surfaces of the CoNi@NCNT. To study the detail ORR mechanism, we computationally designed a cluster model of CoNi cluster and determined the lowest energy state and stability of the CoNi cluster. We found that the CoNi cluster with the spin=3 and multiplicity=4 is the stable conformer and it has the lowest energy state. The CoNi cluster was encapsulated by the N-doped CNT in our model system. To balance the C-valances, extra H-atoms were added in the CoNi@NCNT model system as shown in Fig. 5. We find that ORR starts with O-O chemisorbing onto the surface of CoNi@NCNT.

Similarly, the sufficient rechargeability of ZAB coin cell with bifunctional CoNi@NCNT/NF electrode was also identified by the stable galvanostatic charge-discharge proﬁles in which no obvious potential drop was detected after a long-term cycling of over 28h at 5 mA cm-2. It is worthy of note that the difference between discharge and charge potential (∆EDC) of the ZAB assembled with the CoNi@NCNT/NF electrode (∆EDC = 0.52 V) is much smaller than that of the battery using the Pt/C+RuO2/NF electrode (∆EDC = 0.8 V) and the leading results reported elsewhere.2, 5 The rechargeable performance sufficiently proves the highly efficient and stable catalytic activity of the CoNi@NCNT/NF electrode toward both ORR and OER in such a harsh environment of ZAB coin cell. As shown in Fig. S19, it is found that the CoNi@NCNT/NF electrode still maintains a high-density of NCNT arrays on nickel foam surface after 28h cycling test, suggesting robust characteristics with a long-term stability in ZAB. In a certain sense, a ZAB with high capacity and controllable potentials is desirable for application beyond small electronic devices such hearing aids. For this consideration, we constructed a rechargeable ZAB pouch cell to show that our bifunctional CoNi@NCNT/NF electrode can be applied in a large scale rechargeable ZAB.

However, the ZAB can be designed with a flexible configuration such as a serial or parallel circuit using the pouch cell. Unsurprisingly, the rechargeable ZAB pouch cell assembled with the CoNi@NCNT/NF electrode can be used to start-up a timer (1.5 V, Fig. S20b). Meanwhile, we also examined the durability of the CoNi@NCNT/NF in the rechargeable ZAB pouch cell by long-term discharge-charge cycling test. As a result, the pouch cell using CoNi@NCNT/NF electrode shows superior cycling performance with almost no attenuation after 810 cycles (18h) to that of the pouch cell using Pt/C+RuO2/NF (756 cycles with 16.8h, Fig. S21). For the application of ZAB with a higher output potential, we also designed a pouch cell with two tandem ZABs, as illustrated in Fig. S22. The as-prepared pouch cell with two tandem ZABs was discharged under 10 mA cm-2 over 25h, which exhibited a stable discharge potential at 2.31 V without attenuation (Fig. S23). At the same time, the discharge potentials of 1.06 V and 3.46 V were obtained for the single and the three tandem circuits of ZAB pouch cells, respectively, which suggests an effective strategy to extend the application of our ZAB by controlling of the inner configuration and circuit. CONCLUSIONS In summary, we have developed a strategy for the fabrication of 3D nickel foam supported NCNT arrays where CoNi NPs were individually encapsulated within the NCNT apex. The as- prepared CoNi@NCNT/NF showed efficient catalytic activity toward both ORR and OER, that can be attributed to synergetic contributions from the carbon-encapsulated CoNi NPs and nitrogen doped carbon sites. As a proof of concept, ZAB coin and pouch cells were assembled using CoNi@NCNT/NF as the air electrode. The developed ZAB exhibited an open-circuit potential of 1.40 V, an energy density of 845 Wh kgZn-1 and a peak power density of 108 mW cm-", "page": 16, "position": 0}

The DFT calculations revealed that the carbon-encapsulated CoNi NPs within the NCNT apical domain, due to the d-electrons, further improved catalytic activity of the outermost nitrogen doped carbon and provided additional catalytically active sites on the electrode surface. Incorporation of the apical dominance theory for NCNT array fabrication will undoubtedly pave a way for rationally designed advanced bifunctional electrodes for renewable energy systems.

This procedure was repeated three times to form Co3O4/C3N4/NF (Fig. S1d); iii) Finally, the CoNi@NCNT/NF was obtained by heat treating of Co3O4/C3N4/NF in CVD at 700 oC with N2 flow followed by washing and drying. Synthesis of NCNT/NF The NCNT/NF was synthesized following the same procedure to the CoNi@NCNT/NF, except that the second step of Co3O4 deposition was removed. Characterization The samples were characterized by a field-emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM, ZEISS ultra 55) and a high-resolution JEOL JEM-2100F TEM at 200 kV. Raman spectra were obtained using a Renishaw Raman RE01 scope (Renishaw, Inc.) with a 532 nm excitation argon laser. The chemical state of elements were detected by X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) measurements using a PHI Quantera SXM scanning X-ray microscope. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were obtained by using a powder XRD system (Rigaku D/Max Ultima II, Cu Kα radiation). Nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms were measured at 77 K by a Quantachrome Autosorb-3b Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) Surface Analyzer. Before measurements, all samples were degassed at 383 K under vacuum for 2h. Electrochemical analysis All electrochemical measurements were conducted with a CHI 760E electrochemical workstation in a conventional three-electrode cell, with platinum foil as the counter electrode, Ag/AgCl as the reference electrode, and a catalyst-modified glassy carbon electrode (GCE) as the working electrode.

Catalyst loading was calculated to be 408 g cm-2 for as-prepared catalysts, 204 μg cm-2 for Pt/C and RuO2, respectively. For steady-state linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) measurements, the working electrode was prepared by tailoring CoNi@NCNT/NF, NCNT/NF into 1 x 1 cm2 area. The Pt/C+RuO2/NF electrode was prepared by drop casting the catalyst ink with 2 mg Pt/C and 1 mg RuO2 into nickel foam, and subsequently drying in air. LSVs for ORR were acquired in an O2-saturated 0.1 M KOH aqueous solution at various rotating speeds (225-2025 rpm) with a scan rate of 5 mV s-1. CVs of all samples were tested in a potential range of 0 to -1 V at a scan rate of 50 mV s-1. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were performed by applying an AC voltage with 5 mV amplitude in a frequency range from 100000 to 1 Hz and recorded at 0.85 V (E vs. RHE). The electrical double layer capacitance (Cdl) of the all catalysts were measured from double-layer charging curves using cyclic voltammograms (CVs) in a potential range of 1.08-1.18 V. Before collecting the CV data, the working electrodes were scanned for several cycles until their voltammograms were stabilized. The plot of the current density against scan rate was collected at 1.16 V, which shows a linear relationship, with its slope as the double layer capacitance (Cdl).
