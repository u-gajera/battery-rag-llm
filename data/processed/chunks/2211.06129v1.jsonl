Conventional lithium-ion batteries (LiB) consisting of organic liquid electrolytes are efficient energy storage devices which are successfully commercialized since decades1. Despite continuous improvements, the conventional LiB technology still suffers from safety issues due to the flammability of the liquid electrolytes2,3. Solid state batteries (SSBs)4–7 that use solid electrolytes (SEs)8–17 promise to overcome this limitation by eliminating the use of flammable solvent18–21. SSB technology presents other advantages such as high energy density due to its compatibility with high voltage cathode materials22,23 and opens the possibility to safely use lithium metal as the anode, thus increasing the gravimetric energy density by 40%24,25 and simplifies the manufacturing process26. Within the range of available material for the SE, solid oxide electrolytes27–32 have a high stability in air29, wide electrochemical window33,34 and improved chemical stability with oxide cathodes35; however, their implementation is limited due to their poor ionic conductivity at room temperature36. The superior ionic conductivity of the sulfide SEs compare to their oxide counterparts appears to be related to their reduced grain boundary resistance37. Different strategies have been proposed to decrease grain boundary resistances in oxide SEs, such as the introduction of B2O3 as a microstructure modifier to facilitate the grain growth and to reduce the number of grain boundaries38, or the incorporation of a secondary lithium compounds such as Li3BO3, Li3PO4, Li2O, Li4P2O7 which segregate at the grain boundaries and subsequently inducing lower grain boundary resistance38–40. Nevertheless, the total ionic conductivity of oxide-based SEs, and especially Li1+xAl1-xGe1+x(PO4)3 (LAGP) which exhibits one of the highest ionic conductivities (10-4 S.cm-1 at RT) from the oxide group32,is still an order of magnitude lower in comparison to its sulfide SEs counterparts11,41,42.

LAGP synthetized using excess Li showed an increase in total ionic conductivity due to lithium segregation at the grain boundaries which formed Li-rich structures, subsequently increasing the concentration of the charge carriers which results in an increased grain boundary conductivity46,47. Despite their importance, the structure and the composition of the inter-grain region are still not fully understood which stands as an obstacle for the further development of LAGP-based SSB. To unambiguously identify the origin of the ionic conductivity losses in the inter-grain regions, this work aims to correlate the inter-grain region composition with LAGP ionic conductivity by varying the sintering temperature of LAGP in spark plasm sintered (SPS) sintered pellets. A more complete understanding of the inter-grain microstructure is obtained using complementary macroscopic techniques (compactness and impedance measurements), longer range/periodic structural techniques such as XRD, and short- range/local characterization achieved by SEM-EDX, 3D FIB-SEM tomographic reconstruction and solid-state MAS NMR coupled with materials modelling. This combined approach attempts to investigate whether specific grain boundary phase compositions can induce an improved ionic conductivity performance in the LAGP system.", "page": 3, "position": 0}

In this study, LAGP powder was synthesized using sol-gel method (see the Experimental Methods section). Figure 1a displays the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of the synthesized solid electrolyte that exhibits a tetragonal morphology characterized by a particle size distribution spanning a 0.175 - 3.0 µm range with LAGP particles agglomerated in group of tens of microns (Figure S1a). The Rietveld refinement pattern of sol-gel synthesized solid electrolyte displayed in the Figure 1b shows that the main phase corresponds to LAGP (space group R3-c). However, secondary phases such as GeO2, Li9Al3(P2O7)2(PO4)3 (OPLA), Li4P2O7 and AlPO4 are also present, which are consistent with previous reports on the synthesis of the LAGP phase32,52. Oxides solid electrolytes require high temperatures to get densified and to possess highly ionic conductivity27. Spark plasma sintering (SPS) represents one of the most efficient techniques for obtaining highly dense pellets in short periods of time (see Figure 1c) compared to other methods such as cold or hot sintering53–62. In this work, the SPS temperature was varied (650, 665, 680 and 700 °C) to optimize the compacity of the pellets, and to study the quantities and compositions of the grains and inter-grain phases in correlation with the overall ionic conductivity performance of the pellets54,56,63 (see the Experimental Methods section and Figure S1b in the Supporting Information). The compacity values of the sintered pellets calculated using the Eq. S1 are in the 85 - 99 % range (Figure S2), increasing from its lowest value at a sintering temperature of 650 °C up to its highest value for a sintering temperature of 680 °C, before decreasing again at higher temperatures.

Grain and inter-grain phase ionic conductivity (σg and σig) were calculated based on the obtained resistances values using the Eq. S2 and the overall ionic conductivity is the sum of grain and inter-grain ionic conductivity. The RT impedance data of Figure 2a show that pellets sintered at 650 and 665 °C have much larger inter-grain resistivities (1,155.4 and 1,074.9 ohm.cm, respectively) in comparison to their 680 and 700 °C counterparts (195.7 and 322.6 ohm.cm, respectively), with the 680 °C pellet demonstrating the lowest inter-grain resistivity. Interesting enough, the bulk grain conductivity, contrary to inter-grain ionic conductivity, remains constant (to within experimental error) regardless the sintering temperature. As a result, the total ionic conductivity was monotonically increased with the sintering temperature until 680 °C, then was slightly decreased at 700 °C. A tendency towards higher conductivity was observed with higher compacity, except for the values obtained with 665 °C- and 700 °C-sintered pellets. This difference is due to a lower inter-grain resistivity present in 700 °C-sintered pellet (Figure 2b), which could originate from morphological and compositional changes in grain boundaries/inter-grain phases. From the R2 and R3 resistance values summarized in Table S1 obtained by fitting the impedance data recorded in the -30 - 60 °C range, the Arrhenius plots of Figures 2c-e associated with the grain (1/R2), inter-grain (1/R3) and total (1/R2+1/R3) ionic conductivities versus 1/T can be obtained.

In contrast, for the ion migration through the inter-grain region, the activation energies derived for the samples synthesized at the lower sintering temperatures exhibit marginally lower activation energies indicating a less disturbed ionic migration through the inter-grain region. This difference reflects the range of materials co-existing in the inter-grain regions and the evolving speciation that dominates these regions at the different sintering temperatures. Figure 2.

FIB-SEM tomography provides a 3D representation of the grain and inter-grain region at the micrometer scale, as well as allowing for a quantification of the phase fractions, tortuosity, and local connectivity. Moreover, as the level of contrast in the backscattered electron-SEM (BE-SEM) images can be associated with a given phase, the segmentation of the BE-SEM 3D volume allows to quantify and determine the spatial distribution of each phase present inside the SE. Figure 3(a-d) shows the BE-SEM images that were collected during the FIB- BE-SEM tomography acquisition of the pellets sintered at different temperatures. It is observed that in all the sintered pellets reveals the presence of an inter-grain region and pores surrounding the LAGP grains. The 3D-FIB-BE-SEM analysis shows that the inter-grain phase forms a connected network in all the LAGP grains which can strongly impact the ionic conduction. The presence of such an inter-grain phase located between the LAGP grains most likely constitute the main reason for a lower grain boundaries/inter-grain region ionic conductivity in the pellets sintered at lower temperature. The 3D volumes of the different phases (LAGP grains, inter-grain regions and voids) associated to the pellet sintered at 680 °C are shown in the Figure 3(g-i). The 3D volumes of the pellets obtained at other temperatures and their associated phases (LAGP grains, inter-grain regions, voids, germanium oxide and Al-rich phase) are shown in the Figure S3. From 3D segmented phases, we can extract their relative fraction. Based on the 3D-FIB-BE-SEM analysis the low sintering temperature presents a higher fraction ratio of inter-grain region (spanning 13.8 − 21.4 % range) compared to high sintering temperature (spanning 13.8 − 21.4 % range). The lowest fraction ratio of the inter-grain region was observed for the 680 °C pellet, which also exhibited the lowest grain boundaries contribution suggesting a link between the fraction ratio of the inter-grain phase and total ionic conductivity.", "page": 8, "position": 0}

In terms of ionic conductivity, a tortuosity value of 1 represents a direct path, a larger tortuosity value a less direct paths (more tortuous) between the two sides of the pellets67.

The finite value indicates the presence of a continuous pathway in the inter- grain regions. The infinite values for higher sintering temperatures indicate the inter-grain region does not form a continuous path for the conduction of Li+. The tortuosity values for the grain remain close to 1 except for the 665 °C sintered pellet due to the presence of a dense inter-grain network that prevent a continuous connection of the LAGP grains. The similar tortuosity value of the grain is to put in relation with the similar activation energy measured for the grains by impedance measurements. The lower tortuosity values of the 650 °C and 665 °C pellets might explain the lower activation energies measured for the inter-grain regions for these samples by impedance, i.e., a more continuous inter-grain pathways decreases the energy barrier for the Li+ to propagate through the inter-grain network.

BE-SEM images were formed from a signal proportional to the locally averaged atomic number (Z) of the sample, using such a Z sensitive imaging mode, and in combination with an EDX-SEM dataset acquired at the same locations, each level of contrast in the BE-SEM image can be attributed to a given composition. Using the BE-SEM images, a segmentation process was carried out (Figure S5a) to separate the different phases presented in the analyzed area of each sintered pellets. Thus, the five different levels of contrast in BE-SEM images were attributed to the GeO2, LAGP, AlPO4, inter-grain phase and voids with decreasing level of intensity from white to dark for the 650 °C sample. Further, using a python segmentation code (See details in Supporting Information) the average atomic percent of each phase present in the sample was obtained. The relative at% of each element (except Li) in the grain and inter-grain regions was listed in Table S2. Germanium concentration is found in a significantly lower value for the inter-grain phase in all the analyzed pellets compared to the grains in which its values are closer to the theoretical LAGP.

A range of sintering temperatures have been implemented to investigate the role of morphologies and compositions of the grains and inter-grain region on the ionic conductivity. The predominant finding from this work showed that the bulk ionic conductivity is constant throughout the different sintering temperatures, and that the main difference in the total ionic conductivity was induced by the ionic conductivity at the inter-grain region. The pellets sintered at a lower sintering temperature (650 and 665 °C) exhibited a higher resistance at the inter-grain regions compared to material produced at higher sintering temperatures (680 and 700 °C). The total ionic conductivity was observed to increase with the sintering temperature until 680 °C, followed by a small decrease at 700 °C. Even though sintering at 665 °C and 700 °C created similar compacity values, the latter had higher overall ionic conductivity indicating that morphological and compositional changes in the inter-grain region influence the ionic conductivity. 3D-FIB-SEM tomography revealed the presence of the inter-grain region, creating a network around the LAGP grains. The inter-grain region network was found in a lower proportion for the samples sintered at higher sintering temperature compared to lower sintering temperature, with 680 °C sample exhibiting the lowest inter-grain region and the highest ionic conductivity. Furthermore, along the morphology of the inter-grain region, their composition can explain the observed differences in the ionic conductivity. Cross-section segmented SEM-EDX analyses showed that the inter- grain phase contains significantly lower concentrations of Ge and a higher concentration of P compared to the bulk LAGP grain material.

The stoichiometric amount of Al(OC4H9)3 (Sigma Aldrich) was dissolved in 100 mL THF solution for 2h. Using a syringe Ge(OC2H5)4 (Sigma Aldrich) precursor was added drop by drop in the THF solution and then mixed together at 50 °C. In 100 mL water solution at 60 °C CH3COOLi and NH4H2PO4 precursors were dissolved for 2 hours. After the dissolution of the precursors using a pipette the water solution is added drop by drop in the THF solution and let it overnight at 70 °C for the evaporation of the solvent. The powder obtained is grounded in an agate mortar and then placed for a heat treatment using a heat rate of 1 °C/min. at 850 °C for 2 hours for obtaining the LAGP phase. Spark Plasma Sintering An FCT GmbH HPD10 Spark Plasma Sintering with the chamber in a glovebox was used to obtain compact LAGP pellets. The solid electrolyte powder was packed in a 10 mm (inner diameter) graphite die which was previously inside covered it with graphite paper. A pressure of 8 kN was applied on the pellets to compress the powder and a heating rate of 1 °C/s until the maximum temperature of heating, followed by a plateau of 5 minutes at the maximum temperature and then a controlled cooling within 5 minutes at the room temperature (total sintering time :27 min). The obtained pellets were polished to remove the graphite paper. XRD analysis Each pellet obtained by SPS at different temperatures was grinded in a mortar and pestle to obtain a homogeneous powder. The obtained powder was characterized by X-ray diffraction using a D8 Bruker with Cu Kα radiation (λ1 = 1.5406 Å, λ2 = 1.5444 Å). The", "page": 20, "position": 0}

The automatic slice milling in the volume was realized using a current of 30 kV, 100 pA with a slice thickness of 21 nm and a depth of 8 µm. For the recording imaging conditions, we used 5 kV and 100 pA in order to avoid the damage in the solid electrolyte by a high current probe. Tilt compensator was set to 36 degrees to avoid the distortions which are induced in the image since the images are recorded when the sample is tilted to 54 degrees. Dynamic focus option was used to insure the focus from the top to the bottom of the recorded images. Alignment, Segmentation, and 3D volumes reconstruction ImageJ software was used for the alignment of the images (Linear alignment with SIFT (Translation mode)) and the Trainable Weka Segmentation package was used for the segmentation of the images (Random Forest algorithm). The volumes were reconstructed using the software Dragonfly.

Non- selective (solution) π/2 pulse times of 18 μs were calibrated using 1.1 M AlNO3 from which a selective (solid) π/2 pulses of 6 μs were associated. All 1D 27Al MAS NMR data were acquired using single pulse experiments employing selective 1 μs π/12 pulses, and a recycle delay of 10 s. The corresponding 2D 27Al MQMAS data were acquired at 11.7 and 9.4 T using a 3Q Z-filtered experiment consisting of a 4 μs multiple quantum excitation pulse, a 1.4 μs conversion pulse, a soft π/2 20 μs selective pulse, a 20 μs inter-pulse Z-filter delay, and a 5 s recycle delay.

All 27Al MAS NMR data were referenced against the IUPAC recommended reference of 1.1 M aluminum nitrate (AlNO3) solution (𝛿iso= 0 ppm). The determination of the NMR parameters from featureless quadrupole dominated 27Al resonances is achieved by graphical presentation of variable field 27Al MAS NMR data.

The PQ parameter: 𝑃𝑄= 𝐶𝑄√(1 + 𝜂2 3 ) is closely related to the quadrupolar coupling constant CQ by a factor of ~10 - 15%.", "page": 23, "position": 0}
