For such systems, density-functional theory (DFT) with standard (semi-)local exchange-correlation functionals is of limited use as it often fails due to strong self-interaction errors that are especially relevant in the partially ﬁlled d shells. Here, we perform a detailed comparative study of the phospho-olivine cathode materials LixMnPO4, LixFePO4, and the mixed transition metal LixMn1/2Fe1/2PO4 (x = 0, 1/4, 1/2, 3/4, 1) using four electronic-structure methods: DFT, DFT+U, DFT+U+V , and HSE06. We show that DFT+U+V , with onsite U and intersite V Hubbard parameters determined from ﬁrst principles and self-consistently with respect to the structural parameters by means of density-functional perturba- tion theory (linear response), provides the most accurate description of the electronic structure of these challenging compounds. In particular, we demonstrate that DFT+U+V displays very clearly “digital” changes in oxidation states of the transition-metal ions in all compounds, including the mixed-valence phases occurring at intermediate Li concentrations, leading to voltages in remarkable agreement with experiments. We show that the inclusion of intersite Hubbard interactions is es- sential for the accurate prediction of thermodynamic quantities, balancing the drive for localization induced by the onsite U with intersite V orbital hybridizations. At variance with other methods, DFT+U+V describes accurately such localization-hybridization interplay, and thus opens the door for the study of more complex cathode materials as well as for a reliable exploration of the chemical space of compounds for Li-ion batteries.

I. INTRODUCTION Recent years have witnessed urgent needs for renew- able energy and the availability of energy storage tech- nology that is needed at all scales. One of the major advances in this area can be traced back to the devel- opment of Li-ion rechargeable batteries [1, 2] that are currently employed in a variety of applications, e.g. for portable electronics, power tools, automotive industry, electricity grids, to name a few [3, 4]. These technolo- gies are in increasing demand due to a global increase in energy consumption, widening dependence on the avail- ability of eﬃcient, safe, and nontoxic Li-ion batteries. The properties and performance of Li-ion batteries (such as power and energy density, capacity retention, cyclability, thermal stability, etc.) depend on many fac- tors and their interplay within the complexity of the ac- tual multicomponent devices. As part of this network, cathode materials play a pivotal role, determining the Li intercalation voltage and cyclability of Li+ ions through the interface with the electrolyte. There are various types of cathode materials, among which we mention layered, spinel, olivine, prussian blue, and cation-disordered rock- salt [5–7]. A key ingredient of cathodes are transition- ∗iurii.timrov@epﬂ.ch metal (TM) elements that are electrochemically active species that change their oxidation state during charg- ing and discharging of the battery. It is therefore of paramount importance to understand at the atomistic level what properties of such compounds lead to eﬃcient electrochemical processes. An important tool for studying cathode materials is density-functional theory (DFT) [8, 9], which is a workhorse for ﬁrst-principles simulations in physics, chemistry, and materials science. DFT requires ap- proximations to the exchange-correlation (xc) functional, with local spin-density approximation (LSDA) and spin- polarized generalized-gradient approximation (σ-GGA) being the most popular ones.

DFT requires ap- proximations to the exchange-correlation (xc) functional, with local spin-density approximation (LSDA) and spin- polarized generalized-gradient approximation (σ-GGA) being the most popular ones. However, these approxi- mations often provide some unsatisfactory results (e.g. voltages, formation energies, change in the atomic occu- pations in mixed-valence compounds, etc.) for many TM compounds due to self-interaction errors (SIE) [10, 11] which are especially large for localized d and f electrons. For this reason, more accurate approaches beyond “stan- dard DFT” (i.e. based on LSDA or σ-GGA) are gener- ally used, among which we mention Hubbard-corrected DFT based on LSDA or σ-GGA (so-called LSDA+U and GGA+U [12–14] and its extensions LSDA+U+V and GGA+U+V [15–17] - in the following we will refer to these broadly as DFT+U and DFT+U+V ), meta-GGA functionals such as SCAN [18] (and its ﬂavors [19, 20]) and SCAN+U [21–24], DFT with hybrid functionals (e.g. arXiv:2203.15732v2 [cond-mat.mtrl-sci] 2 Nov 2022", "page": 0, "position": 2}

In DFT+U, the Hubbard U correction is applied selectively only to the partially ﬁlled d states of TM elements to al- leviate SIE for these states [28], while all other states are treated at the level of LSDA or σ-GGA. In contrast, in meta-GGA functionals the kinetic energy density is taken into account and known exact constraints are satisﬁed (17 in the case of SCAN). Finally, in hybrid functionals a fraction of Fock exchange is added (25% in the case of PBE0 and HSE06) and the remainder of exchange is treated at the σ-GGA level, together with 100% of the σ-GGA correlation. In the context of a ﬁrst-principle prediction of the properties of cathode materials, it still remains to establish which of these classes of advanced functionals provides the most accurate, reliable, and com- putationally aﬀordable results. The major interest in the use of Hubbard-corrected DFT comes from its ability to greatly improve the accu- racy of standard DFT with only a marginal increment in the computational cost [29]. However, this is true only if the proper values of the Hubbard parameters are em- ployed. In practice, these are unknown a priori and need to be determined by means of a robust protocol. One strategy that is widespread is to assign bona ﬁde em- pirical values to the Hubbard parameters. For example, DFT+U with U parameters ﬁtted to experimental binary metal formation energies [30] using the Kubaschewski ta- bles [31] have proven to be eﬀective for high-throughput search of novel cathode materials [32–35]. Also, U pa- rameters are often calibrated empirically so that DFT+U calculations reproduce some properties of interest (e.g. band gaps, magnetic moments, lattice parameters, oxi- dation enthalpies - see e.g. Refs. [36–38]), and are used to predict other properties, (e.g. voltages, formation en- ergies, migration barriers, etc.).

If, on one side, exper- imental results might not be available for the Hubbard parameters to be ﬁtted on, on the other the so-tuned U values are not always guarantied to be suitable for accurate predictions of other properties. Hence, ﬁnding empirically a global U parameter that makes accurate predictions on many properties of a given material at the same time is a nontrivial task. In this respect, an alternative and very attractive approach is to compute these parameters using ﬁrst-principle methods [39], such as constrained DFT (cDFT) [40–48], Hartree-Fock based approaches [16, 17, 49–52], and the constrained random phase approximation (cRPA) [53–56]. A linear-response (LR) formulation [57] of cDFT (LR-cDFT) has become a method of choice for many computational Hubbard- corrected DFT studies [58, 59]; moreover, its recent re- formulation in terms of density-functional perturbation theory (DFPT) [60, 61] further boosted its success thanks to the fact that it allows to replace computationally ex- pensive supercells by a primitive cell with monochro- matic perturbations, thus signiﬁcantly reducing the com- putational burden of determining the Hubbard param- eters. DFT+U with Hubbard U computed using LR- cDFT [48, 62–64] or cRPA [65] has proven to be eﬀective in improving intercalation voltages and electronic struc- ture properties of cathode materials, and, remarkably, DFT+U+V with U and V determined from LR-cDFT in a self-consistent fashion [61] was shown to provide ex- cellent agreement with experimental voltages for olivine- type cathode materials [58] thereby highlighting the im- portance of intersite Hubbard V interactions. Finally, Hubbard-corrected DFT calculations are sometimes per- formed including van der Waals (vdW) corrections (es- pecially for layered materials) that were shown to further improve the accuracy of the computed properties [66].

However, it is im- portant to note that despite being very successful for a broad class of materials and properties, SCAN still con- tains signiﬁcant SIE especially when applied to TM com- pounds [67, 68], it exhibits some potential limitations in describing magnetic systems [69, 70], and it suﬀers from strong numerical instabilities [71]. Moreover, from a tech- nical point of view there are currently only few SCAN- based pseudopotentials (PPs) [72] and often GGA-based PPs are used; this inconsistency is known to introduce noticeable errors in calculating some properties of mate- rials as e.g. phase transition energies [73]. Nonetheless, recent applications of SCAN have shown that it gives im- proved description of electronic properties and voltages in layered cathode materials compared to other function- als [74]; however, SCAN does not eliminate the need of the Hubbard U correction in olivine and spinel materi- als [75]. In fact, SCAN with the Hubbard U correction (SCAN+U) was shown to give more accurate predictions for many transition-metal compounds than SCAN [21– 24]. In addition, SCAN and SCAN+U are also used including the vdW corrections [75–78]; at present, only SCAN+rVV10+U is used since the revised Vydrov-Van Voorhis (rVV10) functional [79, 80] is the only vdW func- tional that has been parametrized for SCAN so far [81]. Finally, hybrid functionals exhibit a similar accuracy improvement over standard DFT as they work in the same direction of reducing SIE for TM compounds [82]. At variance with Hubbard functionals and SCAN, how- ever, their use comes at a much higher computational cost than standard DFT. Furthermore, for hybrid functionals, quite often the required fraction of Fock exchange must be tuned in solids in order to reach improved agreement with experiments [83].

The possibility to use hybrids with vdW corrections guarantees their applicability for the study of layered and organic systems [92, 93]. In this paper, we present a detailed comparative study for selected olivine-type cathode materials: LixFePO4, LixMnPO4, as well as the more complex mixed-TM com- pound LixMn1/2Fe1/2PO4 (x = 0, 1/4, 1/2, 3/4, 1). We perform calculations with the four electronic-structure methods: DFT, DFT+U, DFT+U+V , and HSE06, with the aim to assess the reliability of their predictions (e.g., oxidation states and Li intercalation voltages) in com- parison with experiments. We show that DFT+U+V remarkably outperforms the other three well-established methods. A key requirement is that the onsite U and in- tersite V Hubbard parameters are determined from ﬁrst- principles self-consistently using DFPT [60, 61]. In par- ticular, we demonstrate that DFT+U+V accurately pre- dicts the electronic structure not only for the fully delithi- ated/lithiated compounds (x = 0, 1), but also for the in- termediate Li concentrations (x = 1/4, 1/2, 3/4). Over- all, HSE06 and DFT+U results are in good qualitative agreement with DFT+U+V , and superior to standard DFT, but intercalation voltages do not match the quan- titative accuracy shown by DFT+U+V . Importantly, DFT+U+V predicts a “digital” change in atomic occu- pations when gradually changing the Li concentration while DFT averages out the occupations over sites and HSE06 shows a less clear pattern in the “digital” change of occupations for Fe-containing phospho-olivines. This study shows that the inclusion of intersite interactions V is essential for the accurate prediction of thermody- namic quantities when electronic localization occurs in the presence of signiﬁcant interatomic hybridization, con- ﬁrming and enriching the ﬁndings of earlier work by some of us [58].

METHODS In this section we discuss the basics of HSE06 [26, 27], DFT+U [12, 14], and DFT+U+V [15, 29] as well as the main idea of the DFPT approach for computing Hubbard parameters [60, 61]. In the following, we use the generic name “DFT+Hubbard” as broadly referring to any ﬂavor of Hubbard-corrected DFT, which in this paper covers DFT+U and DFT+U+V . For the sake of simplicity, the formalism is presented in the framework of norm- conserving (NC) PPs in the collinear spin-polarized case. Hartree atomic units are used throughout. A. DFT+Hubbard For the sake of generality, here we discuss the DFT+U+V formalism [15]. It can be easily simpliﬁed to DFT+U by setting V = 0. In DFT+U+V , the xc en- ergy contains a (semi-)local functional (e.g., PBEsol [94]) and a corrective Hubbard term [15]: EPBEsol+U+V xc = EPBEsol xc + EU+V xc , (1) where EU+V xc is the Hubbard energy that removes (from the Hubbard manifold) SIE present due to the use of ap- proximations in the xc functional. At variance with the DFT+U approach whose Hubbard corrective term only contains onsite interactions (scaled by U), DFT+U+V also features intersite interactions (scaled by V ) be- tween orbitals centered on diﬀerent sites. In the sim- pliﬁed rotationally-invariant formulation, the extended Hubbard term EU+V xc is deﬁned such that it removes the mean-ﬁeld PBEsol-based interactions in the Hubbard manifold and adds the ones that restore the piecewise lin- ear energy behavior [29], and it reads [15]: EU+V xc = 1 2 X I X σmm′ U I \u0000δmm′ −nIIσ mm′ \u0001 nIIσ m′m −1 2", "page": 2, "position": 1}

In the sim- pliﬁed rotationally-invariant formulation, the extended Hubbard term EU+V xc is deﬁned such that it removes the mean-ﬁeld PBEsol-based interactions in the Hubbard manifold and adds the ones that restore the piecewise lin- ear energy behavior [29], and it reads [15]: EU+V xc = 1 2 X I X σmm′ U I \u0000δmm′ −nIIσ mm′ \u0001 nIIσ m′m −1 2 X I ∗ X J(J̸=I) X σmm′ V IJnIJσ mm′nJIσ m′m , (2) where σ is the spin index, I and J are atomic site indices, m and m′ are the magnetic quantum numbers associated with a speciﬁc angular momentum, U I and V IJ are the eﬀective onsite and intersite Hubbard parameters, and the asterisk in the sum denotes that for each atom I, the index J covers all its neighbors up to a given distance (or up to a given shell). As apparent from its expression, by subtracting a term quadratic in the atomic occupa- tions and substituting it with a linear one, the Hubbard correction contributes to decreasing the curvature of the energy as a function of the occupations of the Hubbard manifold (a measure of the eﬀective self-interaction) and to reestablish a piecewise linear behavior [29]. While such piecewise linearity is not a formal requirement of energy functionals, it has been long argued [28, 57, 95, 96] that it is an essential condition to reduce SIE in systems with very localized (e.g., d and f) electrons. The generalized occupation matrices nIJσ mm′ are based on a projection of the Kohn-Sham (KS) wave functions ψσ v,k(r) on localized orbitals ϕI m(r) of neighbor atoms [15]: nIJσ mm′ = X v,k f σ v,k⟨ψσ v,k|ϕJ m′⟩⟨ϕI m|ψσ v,k⟩, (3) where v is the electronic band index, k indicates points in the ﬁrst Brillouin zone, f σ v,k are the occupations of the KS states, and ϕI m(r) ≡ϕγ(I) m (r −RI) are localized orbitals centered on the Ith atom of type γ(I) at the po- sition RI.

The two terms in Eq. (2) (i.e., proportional to the onsite U I and intersite V IJ couplings) counter- act each other: the onsite term favors localization on atomic sites (thus suppressing hybridization with neigh- bors), while the intersite term favors hybridized states with components on neighbor atoms (thus suppressing the onsite localization). It is the balance between these two competing eﬀects that determines the ground state of the system. Therefore, an accurate evaluation of U I and V IJ is crucial in this respect. In DFT+Hubbard the values of the Hubbard param- eters are not known a priori, and hence they are often adjusted empirically such that the ﬁnal results of sim- ulations match some experimental properties of interest (e.g. band gaps, oxidation enthalpies, etc.). This pro- cedure introduces a degree of arbitrariness (e.g. on the choice of experimental measurements to match) and in- determinacy (there might be several sets of interaction parameters able to reproduce a limited number of exper- imental results) and makes DFT+Hubbard not fully ﬁrst principles. Sometimes the match to experimental mea- surements is also questionable on conceptual grounds, e.g. when a band gap is matched, given that exact DFT would also not reproduce the experimental gap. Most importantly, it restricts the applicability of this correc- tive scheme only to a domain of materials for which the Hubbard parameters can be validated with experimental results and limits its use for investigating the behavior of not-yet synthesized systems. Moreover, it is often for- gotten that the Hubbard U correction is applied using Hubbard projectors that can be deﬁned in many diﬀerent ways [97], e.g. taken from the atomic calculations used to generate the respective pseudopotentials or their or- thogonalized counterparts (see Eq. (7)), and that can be constructed with diﬀerent degrees of oxidation.

Hence, these Hubbard projectors and the respective U parame- ters are not transferable and one should not consider U as a universal number for a given element or material (see the appendix in Ref. [28]). Therefore, a ﬁrst-principles calculation of the Hubbard parameters is essential for quantitative reliability and thus highly desirable. In many cases, where localization occurs on atomic states, the eﬀect of a ﬁnite V might actually be mimicked by a smaller value of U that avoids suppressing intersite hybridization too much. However, there are cases where localization might actually occur on bonds [15], and in these cases the use of an intersite V cannot be mimicked by any small value of U which lacks the physics needed for intersite covalent bonding. Therefore, DFT+U+V where both U and V values are computed from ﬁrst prin- ciples constitutes a robust and accurate approach that describes accurately the onsite localization and intersite hybridization of electrons without any manual calibra- tions of Hubbard parameters. The aforementioned LR-cDFT approach allows us to compute U and V from a generalized piece-wise linear- ity condition [15, 57]. Within this framework the Hub- bard parameters are the elements of an eﬀective interac- tion matrix computed as the diﬀerence between bare and screened inverse susceptibilities [57]: U I = \u0000χ−1 0 −χ−1\u0001 II , (4) V IJ = \u0000χ−1 0 −χ−1\u0001 IJ .

The diﬀerence between χ0 and χ consists in the fact that the for- mer represents the (bare) response to the total poten- tial (i.e., before the electronic charge density readjusts self-consistently), while the latter – the (total) response to the external potential [98].", "page": 3, "position": 1}

In order to avoid com- putationally demanding supercell calculations, required within the LR-cDFT approach to make the perturbation isolated, we have recently recast the LR calculation out- lined above within DFPT, so that the response to iso- lated perturbations can be eﬃciently computed from the superposition of the variation of atomic occupations to monochromatic (i.e., wave-vector-speciﬁc) perturbations using primitive cells [60]: dnIσ mm′ dαJ = 1 Nq Nq X q eiq·(Rl−Rl′)∆s′ q nsσ mm′ . (6) Here, ∆s′ q nsσ mm′ is the response of the occupation ma- trix, I ≡(l, s) and J ≡(l′, s′), where s and s′ are the atomic indices in unit cells while l and l′ are the unit- cell indices. Rl and Rl′ are the Bravais lattice vectors, and the grid of q points is chosen ﬁne enough to make the resulting atomic perturbations eﬀectively decoupled from their periodic replicas. An exhaustive illustration of this approach can be found in Refs. [60, 61], where a recent extension to ultrasoft pseudopotentials and to the projector-augmented-wave method is also discussed. It is crucial to keep in mind that the values of the com- puted Hubbard parameters strongly dependent on the type of Hubbard projector functions ϕI m(r) that are used in DFT+Hubbard [28, 97, 99, 100].

As a matter of fact, DFT+Hubbard with the Löwdin orthogonalized or- bitals has proven to give more accurate results for various properties of materials [103–109], provided the Hubbard parameters are consistently computed with the Löwdin orthogonalized orbitals. Therefore, Hubbard parameters and Hubbard projectors should always be deﬁned consis- tently and reported together. B. HSE06 In the range-separated hybrid functional HSE06 the exchange energy is divided into a short-range (S) and a long-range (L) part. Only 25% of the short-range part consists of the Fock energy and the remaining 75% is the PBE exchange energy, while the long-range exchange part is fully computed at the PBE level [26, 27]. The total xc energy is EHSE06 xc = 1 4EFock,S x + 3 4EPBE,S x + EPBE,L x + EPBE c , (8) where EPBE c is the PBE correlation energy. The Fock short-range energy is the most computationally expensive term and it is deﬁned by generalizing the deﬁnition of Fock [110] as follows: EFock,S x = −1 2 X σ X v,k X v′,k′ Z Z drdr′erfc(ω|r −r′|) × ψσ∗ v,k(r)ψσ v′,k′(r)ψσ∗ v′,k′(r′)ψσ v,k(r′) |r −r′| , (9) where erfc is the complementary error function, ω = 0.106 a−1 0 is the screening parameter with a0 being the Bohr radius [27]. The Fock short-range energy of Eq. (9) contains only exchange interactions at relatively short atomic length scales, and it can be assimilated to a sort of “onsite exchange” and “intersite exchange” energy con- tributions: the former refers to exchange acting between orbitals centered on the same atom while the latter refers to exchange acting between orbitals centered on diﬀerent atoms [91]. This aspect is crucial and in the following we further investigate such an analogy between HSE06 and DFT+Hubbard. C.

As will be shown in what follows, DFT+U+V is as accurate as (and occasionally better than) HSE06 in predicting electronic properties and voltages in phospho-olivines, and we provide a sim- ple qualitative explanation for this. DFT+U and hybrid functionals share one impor- tant feature: they both attempt to correct SIE for or- bitals centered on the same site. However, in contrast to HSE06, DFT+U does not correct for SIE originat- ing from the interactions of orbitals centered on diﬀer- ent (neighboring) sites. This is why for systems with strong covalent bonding DFT+U typically disagrees with HSE06 predictions. In contrast, this latter eﬀect is cap- tured by DFT+U+V , which makes it more general and allows us to cover similar physics as the one described by HSE06. However, it is important to recall that in DFT+U+V only a subset of orbitals are corrected while hybrid functionals act on all the orbitals. Moreover, since typically only nearest-neighbor intersite interactions are taken into account in DFT+U+V , this looks similar to HSE06 that has only the short-range Fock exchange, while long-range eﬀects are fully disregarded both in DFT+U+V and HSE06. D. Crystal structure, magnetic ordering, and further details of calculation The phospho-olivines LixFePO4, LixMnPO4, and LixMn1/2Fe1/2PO4 have an orthorhombic crystal struc- ture at x = 0 and x = 1 with a Pnma space group [112– 114].

The TM atoms (labeled as M with an index from 1 to 4 in Fig. 1) are coordinated by six O atoms forming a MO6 octahedron of which it occupies the center. The P atoms are instead at the center of PO4 tetrahedra that they form with neighboring oxygens. The three- dimensional structure of the crystal can be understood as being based on a network of corner-sharing MO6 oc- tahedra further linked by “interstitial” PO4 tetrahedra that act as structural reinforcer [avoiding excessive vol- ume variations upon Li (de-)intercalation] and chemical stabilizers (useful to avoid oxygen escapes). Li ions reside within octahedral channels parallel to the intermediate- length side of the cell. The phospho-olivines are known to show an anti- ferromagnetic behavior below their transition temper- atures [115–118]. In the previous study (Ref. [58]) it was shown that diﬀerent antiferromagnetic arrangements of spins result in total energies that diﬀer not more than by ∼20 meV at the DFT+Hubbard level of the- ory (largely irrelevant for the calculation of voltages). In this paper we use the magnetic conﬁguration that minimizes the total energy (labeled “AF1” in Ref. [58]), and it is depicted in Fig. 1. Moreover, we use the same spin arrangement in the mixed TM phospho-olivine LixMn1/2Fe1/2PO4.

All technical details of the calculations are described in Sec. S1 of the Supplemental Material (SM) [120]. Hubbard parameters are computed self-consistently us- ing DFPT as described in Sec.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION A. Oxidation states, Löwdin occupations, and magnetic moments The concept of oxidation state (OS) is central and ubiquitous in chemistry and physics, it is widely used to describe redox reactions, electrolysis, and many elec- trochemical processes as it allows to track electron move- ment during reactions [122]. The main idea is that the variations in electron number must be integer and this assigns the OS of an ion [123]. However, OS has long eluded a proper quantum- mechanical interpretation. Numerous methods have been proposed to determine the OS, and such methods often infer the OS of ions from schemes for allocating charges to ions.

The main idea is that the variations in electron number must be integer and this assigns the OS of an ion [123]. However, OS has long eluded a proper quantum- mechanical interpretation. Numerous methods have been proposed to determine the OS, and such methods often infer the OS of ions from schemes for allocating charges to ions. These schemes can be classiﬁed into categories, among which we mention: i) partition of space with inte- gration of the total charge density within space allocated to each ion (e.g. Bader [124] and Voronoi [125] charges), and ii) projection of the electronic wavefunctions onto a localized basis (e.g. Mulliken [126] and Löwdin [101] charges, or natural bond orbitals [127]). On the one hand, in the partition schemes all orbitals contribute to the charge within the allocated volume (e.g. a sphere of a certain radius centered on an ion), thus losing the connec- tion to the OS of individual ions and its certain manifold (e.g. d orbitals of TM elements). On the other hand, projection schemes present a dependence on the type of projector functions that are used to construct the local- ized basis set (and dependence on the cutoﬀradii used in some methods). The electronic populations computed using these methods are quite useful to give an indication of the OS, however these populations are often noninte- ger and their changes during redox reactions are signiﬁ- cantly smaller than the changes in the nominal electron numbers for the end elements of the reaction. Raebiger et al. [128] have pointed out that the net physical charge be- longing to a TM atom is essentially independent of its OS and this is due to the negative-feedback charge regulation mechanism that is inherent to TM compounds [129, 130]. The diﬃculty in accurate and unambiguous determina- tion of the OS of ions has inspired the development of novel methods. Among these, we highlight the method of Ref. [131] which is based on wavefunction topology and the modern theory of polarization, and the method of Ref.

S5 in SM [120] we also discuss the determi- nation of OS based on magnetic moments computed by integrating the diﬀerence between the spin-up and spin- down components of the spin-charge density over atomic spheres of varying radius centered on ions [133].

According to Ref.

This agrees well with the nominal OS shown in Table I and depicted in Fig. 2. In addition we ﬁnd that Mn and Fe are in a high-spin state in agreement with experiments [117, 118, 135].

The horizontal dashed lines correspond to the Löwdin occupations of the end elements (x = 0 and x = 1) with their corresponding oxidation states determined using the data in Table I. For each material there are four TM atoms, each of which is represented with a bar. (corresponding to λ↑ 1) features occupations in the range from 0.40 to 0.54 due to mixing with O-2p ligand states, whereas much smaller ﬁlling of all d states occurs in the spin-down channel. Therefore, a larger deviation from 0 of the eigenvalues indicates a stronger mixing of the unoc- cupied d orbitals with the ligand orbitals, in accordance with the prescription of Ref. [121]. Table I also contains the Löwdin occupations n and magnetic moments m, which are often used to determine the OS of ions. However, as we discussed earlier, these are not always appropriate descriptors of the OS: due to the hybridization of the TM orbitals with the states of their ligands, it is diﬃcult to assign the correct num- ber of electrons to the TM ions; moreover, the number of electrons on TM orbitals undergoes smaller changes than predicted by the nominal OS during (de-)lithiation due the negative-feedback charge regulation mechanism dis- cussed in Ref.

Similar trends are also ob- served for MnPO4 and LiMnPO4, which suggests that the TM-ligand intersite electronic interactions are slightly stronger in the fully lithiated olivines. Nevertheless, the Löwdin occupations (and magnetic moments) are still very useful quantities for bookkeeping [128], in partic- ular when describing the gradual (de-)lithiation process as discussed in the following.

Here we do not show the DFT+U results since these are known to be less accurate than the DFT+U+V ones in olivines e.g. for x = 1/2 [58]; in addition, the simulta- neous convergence of the Hubbard U parameters within DFT+U and the crystal structure in a self-consistent fashion [61] is problematic for x = 1/4 and 3/4 (which requires further investigation). We stress that no con- vergence issues were found when using self-consistent DFT+U+V . Our main goal here is to compare the accuracy of the DFT+U+V approach versus the well- established HSE06 one. In the case of LixMnPO4, we can see that DFT+U+V and HSE06 agree remarkably well and both show a “digital” change in the Löwdin oc- cupations: adding one Li+ ion and one electron to the cathode during the lithiation process leads to changes in the occupation from 4.98 to 5.21 (and to the correspond- ing change in the OS from +3 to +2, see Table I) of only one Mn ion (that accepts this extra electron) while all other Mn ions remain unchanged. This process continues when we go on with the Li intercalation until eventually all Mn ions reduce from +3 to +2. Thus, these two ap- proaches successfully describe the mixed-valence nature of the LixMnPO4 compound that contains two types of Mn ion, Mn3+ and Mn2+, at x = 1/4, 1/2, 3/4. In con- trast, DFT fails to localize an extra electron on one of the Mn ions and as a consequence the charge density is spread out and equally distributed among all Mn ions in the system with approximately equal occupations, as can be seen in Fig. 3. Hence, in DFT at x = 1/4, 1/2, 3/4 there is only one type of Mn ions whose occupations are intermediate (and progressively changing with Li con- tent) between those of the +2 and +3 ions.

In the case of LixFePO4, our results are similar with the diﬀerence that here only DFT+U+V shows the “digital” change in Löwdin occupations while HSE06 does not manage to de- scribe accurately the localization of electrons on Fe ions. This seems to suggest that the global mixing parameter of 0.25 of HSE06 turns out to be ineﬀective at describ- ing complex electronic interactions in LixFePO4, while DFT+U+V with site-dependent self-consistent Hubbard U and V parameters proves capable at capturing the local chemistry (in particular, the varying amount of 3d−2p in- tersite hybridization) and the “digital” change in the OS of Fe ions. Finally, in LixMn1/2Fe1/2PO4 we ﬁnd that Mn3+ ions are the ﬁrst to reduce to Mn2+ when lithiat- ing the compound from x = 0 to x = 1/4 and x = 1/2, and only at higher Li concentrations (from x = 1/2 to x = 1) Fe3+ ions reduce to Fe2+. Importantly, we ﬁnd that both DFT+U+V and HSE06 agree to describe the change in the Löwdin occupations on Mn ions, while for Fe ions we again ﬁnd that DFT+U+V outpaces HSE06 in terms of accuracy; in fact, the change in the occupa- tion of Fe-3d states is not as sharp as the one obtained from the Hubbard correction. Similar trends are also ob- served for magnetic moments for these three materials (see Sec. S5 in SM [120]). B.

III A). Instead, the Li-donated extra elec- tron is spread out over all Fe and Mn ions that results in approximately equal PDOS for the likewise TM ele- ments. In contrast, both DFT+U+V and HSE06 change drastically the PDOS compared to the DFT-based one: the material preserves its insulating character (i.e., a ﬁ- nite band gap) during the whole process of lithiation from x = 0 up to x = 1 (the reader is referred to Sec. S8 in the SM [120] for the values of band gaps). When changing x from 0 to 1/4 (i.e. intercalating one Li+ ion and adding one electron to the olivine cathode material), only the PDOS of one Mn ion (labeled as “Mn4”) changes by shift- ing Mn-3d empty states to higher energies in the spin-up channel and Mn-3d occupied states closer to the top of the valence bands in the spin-down channel. Further- more, by changing x from 1/4 to 1/2 the PDOS of the second Mn ion (labeled as “Mn2”) changes in", "page": 8, "position": 2}

Further- more, by changing x from 1/4 to 1/2 the PDOS of the second Mn ion (labeled as “Mn2”) changes in the same way as the PDOS of Mn4 but mirrored with respect to the spin channels. This is in line with the fact that Mn is the ﬁrst species to change its occupation when lithiating the structure from x = 0 to x = 1/2 as shown in Fig. 3. By further lithiating the cathode material from x = 1/2 to 3/4 and ﬁnally from 3/4 to 1 we can see that now the PDOS of the two Fe ions (labeled as “Fe1” and “Fe3”) change by shifting Fe-3d empty states to higher energies and Fe-3d occupied states towards the top of the valence bands. These changes in the PDOS are consistent with the reduction of Mn3+ to Mn2+ and of Fe3+ to Fe2+ (see Sec. III A). It is interesting to note that the occupied Fe- 3d states are localized and show small hybridization with O-2p ligand states for x in the range 0 to 1/2 (red and violet peaks at around −8 eV) while, for x from 1/2 to 1, they move up in energy thus overlapping with the O-2p states (from −7 to 0 eV) and becoming more dispersive. This latter eﬀect is well captured both in HSE06 and DFT+U+V since both describe the intersite electronic", "page": 8, "position": 3}

It is instructive to highlight the diﬀerences in the PDOS computed using DFT+U+V and HSE06. While both methods show changes in the character of the top of the valence bands when going from x = 0 to 1, the ﬁne details are diﬀerent.

In addition, in DFT+U+V we can see a clearer energy sep- aration between the Fe-3d and Mn-3d empty states at x = 0, while within HSE06 these states are closer in en- ergy. At x = 1/4 and x = 1/2, both methods show that the top of the valence bands is dominated by the Mn-3d states, although in HSE06 the intensity of these states is much stronger than in DFT+U+V . Finally, at x = 3/4 and 1 these two methods give diﬀerent predic- tions for the character of the top of the valence bands. In HSE06 at x = 1, Fe-3d states are the highest occu- pied states while Mn-3d states lie deeper in energy and there is an energy gap between these two sets of states. In contrast, in DFT+U+V at x = 1 there is no gap be- tween the Fe-3d and Mn-3d occupied states, and all these states overlap in energy and thus the top of the valence bands is predominantly of the Fe-3d and Mn-3d charac- ter. To the best of our knowledge there is no experimen- tal data from photoemission and x-ray absorption spec- troscopy measurements, so it is not possible to establish which method gives a more accurate description of the electronic structure of LixMn1/2Fe1/2PO4. However, the fact that DFT+U+V can capture the “digital” change of Löwdin occupations (especially for Fe ions) upon the lithiation of olivines (as shown in Sec. III A) suggests that the PDOS from DFT+U+V is probably more reli- able than that from HSE06. Further investigations are required in order to shed more light on this issue. But the overall agreement between trends in the PDOS com- puted within DFT+U+V and HSE06 proves that these two methods - despite having very diﬀerent mathemati- cal formulations and theoretical background (see Sec.

Lithium intercalation voltages The topotactic Li intercalation voltages can be com- puted using the fundamental thermodynamic deﬁni- tion [58, 137]: Φ = −E(Lix2S) −E(Lix1S) −(x2 −x1)E(Li) (x2 −x1)e , (10) where S is introduced for the sake of shorthand nota- tion and it denotes e.g. MnPO4 for LixMnPO4 and sim- ilarly for other cathode materials considered in this pa- per. Here, Φ is the voltage, e is the electronic charge, x1 and x2 are the concentrations of Li and they take val- ues between 0 and 1 in this study, and E is the total energy per formula unit. It is important to remark that E(Li) is the total energy of bulk Li computed at the level of standard DFT (PBEsol functional) while E(Lix1S) and E(Lix2S) are computed using the four approaches considered in this work: DFT, HSE06, DFT+U, and DFT+U+V (U and V are computed self-consistently in- dividually for each structure [58]). We note that entropic and pressure-volume eﬀects are neglected when comput- ing Φ since these are known to not signiﬁcantly impact average Li intercalation voltages [138]. Figure 5 shows a comparison between computed volt- ages and experimental ones from Refs. [114, 136]. For LixMnPO4 and LixFePO4 we compute the average volt- ages in the range 0 < x < 1 (thus x1 = 0 and x2 = 1) since experimentally it is known that there is only one plateau in the voltage proﬁle [114]. In contrast, for LixMn1/2Fe1/2PO4 we compute the average voltages in two ranges of x, 0 < x < 1/2 and 1/2 < x < 1, which correspond to the two plateaus observed experimentally in the voltage proﬁle [114].

As discussed in previous sections, 0 < x < 1/2 corresponds to the reduction of Mn ions and hence the voltage is similar to that of LixMnPO4, while 1/2 < x < 1 corresponds to the re- duction of Fe ions with a voltage that is similar to that of LixFePO4. Experimentally it is known that the mix- ing of TM cations creates shifts in redox potentials: the voltage of the Mn2+/3+ couple is decreased by ∼0.08 V while the voltage of the Fe2+/3+ couple is increased by ∼0.05 V when going from the pristine end members (LixMnPO4 and LixFePO4) to the mixed TM olivine (LixMn1/2Fe1/2PO4) [114, 136]. The shifts in redox po- tentials were also observed in previous DFT+U-based calculations [139–141] and were attributed to changes in the TM−O bond lengths [114, 136, 141] or strain [140]. As can be seen from Fig. 5, standard DFT largely un- derestimates the voltages (on average 22 −31% oﬀwith respect to the experiments). This demonstrates that the energetics is strongly aﬀected by the delocalization of TM d electrons due to the strong SIE inherent to xc func- tionals (such as e.g. PBEsol). HSE06 alleviates these errors partially and improves the energetics, however the resulting voltages are overestimated by 6 −15%. It is worth noting that our HSE06-based voltages are signiﬁ- cantly higher than those of Ref. [82] that reports 3.87 V for LixMnPO4 and 3.33 V for LixFePO4 using HSE06. These discrepancies are likely due to various diﬀerences in computational details (diﬀerent pseudopotentials, screen- ing parameter ω, kinetic-energy cutoﬀ, k points sam- pling, etc.) and diﬀerent geometries (here we use the DFT+U+V geometry for HSE06 calculations while in Ref. [82] the HSE06-optimized geometry was used). We recall that in HSE06 the amount of Fock exchange is ﬁxed to 25%, and it", "page": 10, "position": 2}

The experimental data is from Refs. [114, 136]. ages result closer to the experimental value). Over- all, DFT+U voltages are scattered over a wider range (3 −14%) around the experimental values than those obtained from HSE06. It is useful to remark that our DFT+U voltages for LixMnPO4 and LixFePO4 are in better agreement with the experimental ones than those of Ref. [58]; as was pointed out in Ref. [61], this is a conse- quence of the diﬀerence in the values of U, and of the con- sistent calculation of forces and stresses using the orthog- onalized atomic Hubbard projectors [see Eq. (7)] that has signiﬁcantly reﬁned the prediction of the equilibrium crystal structure in this work. Finally, DFT+U+V gives the most accurate predictions of voltages compared to all other methods considered in this work. More speciﬁcally, the average deviation of DFT+U+V voltages from the experimental values is in the 1 −7% range; leaving aside the LixMn1/2Fe1/2PO4 case with 1/2 < x < 1, the aver- age deviation is 1−2% which is remarkable given the fact that the DFT+U+V calculations are fully ﬁrst-principles with no ﬁtting or adjusted parameters. This ﬁnding demonstrates that the accuracy of the DFT+U+V ap- proach with U and V computed using linear-response theory [57, 60] in a self-consistent fashion [58, 61] is satis- factory for predictive simulations of olivine-type cathode materials.

These redox potential shifts are similar to those obtained within HSE06, namely 0.14 and 0.15 V for the Mn2+/3+ and Fe2+/3+ couples, respectively. Therefore, both DFT+U+V and HSE06 overestimate the experi- mental redox potential shifts. At the same time we ob- serve changes in the Mn−O and Fe−O bond lengths in the mixed TM olivine compared to the pristine end mem- bers (see Table S2 of SM [120]), in consistency with the hypothesis of Refs. [114, 136, 141] that these might be responsible for the redox potential shifts. These promising results and observations motivate in- vestigations of other classes of cathode materials using the extended Hubbard functional, and the work in this di- rection is in progress. Furthermore, the predictive power of DFT+U+V might help to obtain further insights on still problematic aspects of the considered systems, e.g. the asymmetric charge-discharge behavior of LixFePO4 possibly promoted by the existence of a hidden two-step phase transition via a metastable phase [142]. D. General remarks In the previous sections we have shown that DFT+U+V is a powerful tool for the accurate descrip- tion of the structural, electronic, magnetic, and electro- chemical properties of phospho-olivines. It is useful to provide general remarks about this approach compared to state-of-the-art approaches that are currently used. Computational cost. DFT+U+V is only marginally more expensive than DFT+U when the parameters U and V are known, and both these methods are only slightly more demanding than plain DFT. However, the cost of computing U and V using DFPT is an order- of-magnitude larger (with some prefactor that depends on the number of symmetries, number of nonequivalent atoms of the same type, etc.) than ground-state DFT calculations. Therefore, the cost of the DFT+U+V cal- culation itself is negligible compared", "page": 11, "position": 1}

[82]). Con- versely, structural optimization using DFT+U+V are absolutely aﬀordable and the main cost comes from the evaluation of Hubbard forces and stresses using Löwdin- orthogonalized atomic orbitals [97]. We note that the structural optimization using DFT+U+V is inherently incorporated in the self-consistent protocol of the eval- uation of the Hubbard parameters that brings the sys- tem to the global minimum [61]. Therefore, overall the self-consistent DFT+U+V approach is much more af- fordable than HSE06 although obviously more expensive than DFT+U with empirical U parameters. Dependence on the availability of the experimental data. The strength of the DFT+U+V approach used here is that it is “parameter-free” in the sense that U and V are computed from ﬁrst principles without relying on any experimental data. This makes this approach predic- tive for novel materials for which experimental data are not available and allows us to capture the dependence of the Hubbard parameters, e.g., on the local chemical environment and on the OS. As for what concerns hy- brids, when tuning the fraction of Fock exchange is nec- essary to improve their predictivity an empirical strategy can also be adopted, presenting the same disadvantages as for empirically-tuned Hubbard-corrected functionals. First-principles calculations of these parameters have also become increasingly popular in recent years [84–89]: how- ever, they tend to further increase the already signiﬁcant computational costs. Generalizations and limitations. The DFT+U+V framework is very general, it can be used with any xc functional, e.g. PBE [143], PBEsol [94], SCAN [18], rSCAN [19], r2SCAN [20], etc. Since SCAN and its ﬂa- vors are gaining more and more popularity in the com- munity, it would be very useful and important to gen- eralize DFT+U+V to meta-GGAs. In practice, though, this requires, ﬁrst of all, the availability of the meta- GGA pseudopotentials, and, secondly, the generalization of DFPT to meta-GGAs for a consistent evaluation of the Hubbard interactions.

In practice, though, this requires, ﬁrst of all, the availability of the meta- GGA pseudopotentials, and, secondly, the generalization of DFPT to meta-GGAs for a consistent evaluation of the Hubbard interactions. As for what concerns limita- tions, currently our formulation of DFT+U+V does not include the Hund’s J corrections that are known to be important in some classes of materials [144]. Moreover, DFT+U+V is a mean-ﬁeld approach based on a single Slater determinant, hence systems for which the multiref- erence nature of the wave function is important are be- yond reach for the current formulation of DFT+U+V . Finally, as mentioned earlier, the simultaneous conver- gence of the Hubbard U parameters within DFT+U and the crystal structure in a self-consistent fashion [61] is problematic for some fractional concentrations of Li that might be due to the missing derivatives of the Hubbard parameters with respect to atomic positions when com- puting Hubbard forces [145]. Data set and databases. In the present work we con- sider only three examples from the same family of cath- ode materials (containing only two diﬀerent TM ions, Mn and Fe). Therefore, our work is by no means conclusive and the accuracy of DFT+U+V for other classes of cath- ode materials (e.g. layered, spinel, etc.) has to be veriﬁed thoroughly and with care. However, the promising re- sults presented in this work for phospho-olivines are very encouraging and the whole computational DFT+U+V framework is indeed very robust. Work is in progress for the development of automated DFT+U+V workﬂows for the high-throughput calculations for cathode materials using AiiDA [146, 147], which would allow us to gener- ate large databases of cathode materials’ properties and benchmark them versus data obtained using state-of-the- art methods and data from experiments.

IV. CONCLUSIONS We have presented the ﬁrst comparative study (us- ing DFT, DFT+U, DFT+U+V , and HSE06) of the electronic properties and the energetics of lithium inter- calation in representative phospho-olivine cathode ma- terials: LixMnPO4, LixFePO4, and LixMn1/2Fe1/2PO4 (x = 0, 1/4, 1/2, 3/4, 1). In DFT+U and DFT+U+V , the Hubbard parameters U and V have been computed from ﬁrst principles using density-functional perturba- tion theory, without any need for adjustments or ad hoc ﬁtting of the model. By determining the oxidation state of TM ions using the projection-based method of Ref. [121], we were able to analyse the change in Löwdin occupations of the d man- ifolds during the lithiation process. We have found that DFT fails to account for the onset of disproportionation of the TM atoms along the intermediates of the lithia- tion process. In contrast, DFT+U+V correctly predicts the “digital” change of Löwdin occupations upon Li in- tercalation (only one TM ion changes its oxidation state from +3 to +2 for each Li ion added) in all materials studied here. For comparison, HSE06 shows the “dig- ital” change in occupations for LixMnPO4 but it fails to do so for LixFePO4 at x = 1/4 and 3/4 and for LixMn1/2Fe1/2PO4 at x = 3/4. Furthermore, the inves- tigation of the electronic structure has revealed that both DFT+U+V and HSE06 qualitatively show similar trends in the spin-resolved projected density of states, while DFT fails dramatically due to strong self-interactions er- rors. Finally, the computed intercalation voltages are greatly underestimated within DFT, whereas HSE06 brings voltages closer to the experimental values, albeit with a slight systematic overestimation. On the other hand, while DFT+U is on average only slightly worse than HSE06, DFT+U+V outperforms HSE06 in terms of accuracy, achieving voltages in very good agreement with experiments.

Technical details All calculations were performed using the plane-wave (PW) pseudopotential implementation of DFT contained in the Quantum ESPRESSO distribution [1–3]. We have used the exchange-correlation functional constructed using σ-GGA with the PBEsol prescrip- tion [4]. For DFT, DFT+U, and DFT+U+V calculations we have used pseudopotentials (PPs) from the SSSP library v1.1 (precision) [5, 6], which are either ultrasoft (US) or projector-augmented-wave (PAW): For manganese we have used mn_pbesol_v1.5.uspp.F.UPF from the GBRV v1.5 library [7], for iron and oxygen Fe.pbesol-spn-kjpaw_psl.0.2.1.UPF and O.pbesol-n-kjpaw_psl.0.1.UPF from the Pslibrary v0.3.1 [8], for phosphorus P.pbesol-n-rrkjus_psl.1.0.0.UPF from the Pslibrary v1.0.0 [9], and for lithium li_pbesol_v1.4.uspp.F.UPF from the GBRV v1.4 library [7]. For HSE06 calculations we have used norm-conserving PPs from the PseudoDojo library [10]. To construct the Hubbard projector functions ϕI m(r) [see Eq. (9) in the main text] we have used atomic orbitals which are orthogonalized using Löwdin’s method [11, 12]. Structural optimizations using DFT+U and DFT+U+V are performed using orthogonalized atomic orbitals as described in detail in Ref. [13]. The Brillouin zone was sampled using the uniform Γ-centered k point mesh of size 5×8×9. Kohn-Sham (KS) wavefunctions and potentials are expanded in PWs up to a kinetic-energy cutoﬀof 90 and 1080 Ry, respectively, for structural optimization. The crystal structure was optimized using the Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (BFGS) algorithm [14], with a convergence threshold for the total energy of 10−6 Ry, for forces of 10−5 Ry/Bohr, and for pressure of 0.5 Kbar. For the metallic ground states (that appear at the DFT level of theory and intermediate Li concentrations), we have used the Marzari-Vanderbilt smearing method [15] with a broadening parameter of 0.01 Ry. For the formation energy calculations of LixFePO4 and LixMn1/2Fe1/2PO4 we used tighter parametrization in order to ensure the convergence of the results: we used a 8×10×12 uniform Γ-centered k point mesh and the kinetic-energy cutoﬀof 120 and 1440 Ry for the KS wavefunctions and potentials, respectively. The DFPT calculations of Hubbard parameters are performed", "page": 19, "position": 0}

The DFPT calculations of Hubbard parameters are performed using the HP code [16] of Quantum ESPRESSO using the uniform Γ-centered k and q point meshes of size 3×4×5 and 1×2×3, respectively, which give an accuracy of 0.01 eV for the computed values of U and V . The KS wavefunctions and potentials are expanded in PWs up to a kinetic-energy cutoﬀof 65 and 780 Ry, respectively, for calculation of Hubbard parameters. The linear-response KS equations of DFPT are solved using the conjugate-gradient algorithm [17] and the mixing scheme of Ref. [18] for the response potential to speed up convergence. The HSE06 (PBE + 25% short-range Fock) calculations are performed using the uniform Γ-centered k and q point meshes of size 6×8×10 and 3×4×5, respectively. We recall here that the use of the q point mesh is diﬀerent in HSE06 and in DFPT: in the former case, the q mesh is a coarsened k mesh that is used to reduce the computational cost of the HSE06 calculations; in the latter case the q points represent the wavevectors of monochromatic perturbations that are applied to the system to study its (linear) response [19]. The q →0 limit in HSE06 was treated using the Gygi-Baldereschi scheme [20]. The KS wavefunctions and potentials are expanded in PWs up to a kinetic-energy cutoﬀ of 80 and 320 Ry, respectively, while the exact-exchange (Fock) term was expanded in PWs up to 80 Ry. All HSE06 calculations were performed using the DFT+U+V optimized geometry (since the HSE06 structural optimizations are computationally too expensive for phospho-olivines). Bulk Li is modelled at the DFT-PBEsol level using the bcc unit cell with one Li atom at the origin. The optimized lattice parameter is 3.436 Å. The Brillouin zone", "page": 19, "position": 1}

Hubbard parameters Table S1 contains the values of onsite U and intersite V Hubbard parameters for Mn(3d) and Fe(3d) states in phospho-olivines considered here, which were computed in the framework of DFT+U+V self-consistently using DFPT [19, 22] with orthogonalized atomic orbitals as Hubbard projectors, as described in Sec. II.C of the main text. We have also computed the onsite Hubbard U in the framework of DFT+U – these values are smaller than U’s re- ported in Table S1 due to diﬀerences in the electronic screening [23]. More speciﬁcally, within DFT+U for LixMnPO4 we obtain U(Mn)=6.19 eV for x = 0 and U(Mn)=4.30 eV for x = 1; for LixFePO4, Hubbard U(Fe)=5.00 eV for x = 0 and U(Fe)=4.99 eV for x = 1; and, for LixMn1/2Fe1/2PO4, U(Fe)=5.01 eV and U(Mn)=6.23 eV for x = 0, and U(Fe)=4.97 eV and U(Mn)=4.32 eV for x = 1.

From Table S1 we can see how the values of Hubbard parameters change upon lithiation of the phospho-olivines. The general trend when going from x = 0 to x = 1 is that the values of Hubbard parameters decrease. Namely, Hubbard U decreases because the 3d manifolds of TM ions acquire an extra electron due to the insertion of Li. This suggests that a larger number of electrons on the same ion promotes the screening of the eﬀective Hubbard interactions thus leading to lower values. Also intersite Hubbard V values decrease when going from x = 0 to x = 1. This latter fact can probably be related to the structural expansion (unit cell volume and TM–O bond length, see Fig. S1) that the system undergoes upon lithiation; the longer the bond between two atoms, the smaller the intersite Hubbard interaction V .", "page": 20, "position": 1}

In general, we ﬁnd that there is a good agreement between these two studies, with largest diﬀerences for the Hubbard parameters being ∼0.3 eV in the DFT+U+V framework. However, in the DFT+U framework the largest diﬀerence in the Hubbard U is ∼2 eV. These diﬀerences stem from the fact that in this paper we consistently use orthogonalized atomic orbitals for the calculation of Hubbard parameters and for the structural optimization (i.e. to compute Hubbard forces and stresses [13]), whereas in Ref. [23] the orthogonalized atomic orbitals were used for the calculation of Hubbard parameters while structural optimizations were based on nonorthogonalized atomic orbitals (since at that time there was no implementation of Hubbard energy derivatives with orthogonal atomic basis set). This highlights the importance of consistency in using the same type of Hubbard projector functions across all calculations. Finally, it is informative to comment about a change in the Hubbard parameters when gradually changing the concentration of Li. We stress that Hubbard parameters are site-dependent quantities, i.e. they are not global averaged values that are the same for all TM ions. Interestingly, from Table S1 we can see that Hubbard U’s for diﬀerent TM elements of a given material do not change in a monotonic way upon Li intercalation. This ﬁnding is consistent with Ref. [23]. In other words, the U values do not change in a digital manner in contrast to the Löwdin occupations in Fig. 3 of the main text. This fact is a consequence of the Hubbard parameters being computed self- consistently with Li content: when additional Li ions are inserted in the crystal the structural readjustment leads to a general change of the Hubbard parameters of all TM ions, although the closest to the additional Li are typically aﬀected the most.

We do not present here the DFT+U crystal structure parameters because, as stated in the main text, for some concentrations of Li the self-consistent evaluation of Hubbard parameters fails to converge. Moreover, HSE06 structural optimizations were not performed because of their large computational cost. It can be seen in Fig. S1 that the lattice parameters a and b increase upon Li intercalation, while the lattice parameter c decreases. This is in agreement with the experimental trends. At x = 1 all computed lattice parameters are in remarkable agreement with the experimental values, with DFT+U+V results being slightly more accurate than the DFT ones. At x = 0 for LixFePO4, the DFT and DFT+U+V lattice parameters almost coincide and they somewhat overestimate the experimental ones. For LixMnPO4, at x = 0 the computed lattice parameter a is very similar between and it is in good agreement with experiments, while the experimental value of b is in-between the DFT and DFT+U+V predictions. The main distinction between DFT and DFT+U+V arises for the c lattice parameter of the delithiated phase MnPO4; the c parameter is overestimated in DFT and even more in DFT+U+V [23]. This stronger departure from the experiment of DFT+U+V compared to DFT inﬂuences the local geometry and makes some implicit incidence on the ﬁnal properties. Nevertheless, the extent of corresponding relative error is less than 2%.

Similarly, for FePO4 the optimized c lattice parameter shows the largest deviation from the experimental one, though DFT and DFT+U+V are now in better agreement. The angles α, β, and γ are all 90◦at x = 0 and x = 1 because of the orthorhombic symmetry of the crystal, in agreement with experiments [24–26]. However, at intermediate Li concentrations, x = 1/4, x = 1/2 and x = 3/4, both DFT and DFT+U+V predict distorted equilibrium crystal structures, with deviations from the orthorhombic symmetries that depend on the speciﬁc angle, the speciﬁc material, and the concentration of Li, and become slightly more pronounced in the presence of Mn. In Fig. S1, we also show the cell volume at diﬀerent Li concentrations. The general trend is that the addition of Li expands the lattice and the cell volume increases. At x = 1 we ﬁnd that the DFT+U+V volumes are in remarkable agreement with the experimental ones while DFT volumes are somewhat underestimated. In contrast, at x = 0 we observe that both DFT and DFT+U+V volumes overestimate the experimental one in LixFePO4, while in LixMnPO4 the DFT volume is in good agreement with the experimental one while the DFT+U+V volume is overestimated. Overall we ﬁnd that the accuracy of DFT+U+V is fairly good for predicting the crystal structural parameters. For this reason we used the DFT+U+V structural parameters also for the HSE06 calculations. It is useful to comment on the structural data of the MO6 octahedra (M = Fe, Mn) upon the lithiation/delithiation. The results are shown in Table S2. We use the conventional notation for the four kinds of bonds [28]: M-O1, M- O2, M-O3, and M-O3′. The directions of M-O1 and M-O2 are axial, while two of M-O3 and two of M-O3′ are equatorial (see Fig. S2). The MO6 octahedra belong to Cs point group symmetry, and the symmetry is conserved upon lithiation/delithiation [29]. From Table", "page": 21, "position": 2}

This distortion is not a strict Jahn-Teller type, because there is no symmetry reduction in MnO6 (the Cs point group symmetry is preserved) [29].

Here, E(LixS), E(LiS), and E(S) are the total energies per formula unit for the compounds LixS, LiS, and S, respectively. The results are shown in Fig. S4 for the three phospho-olivines studied here. As known from previous studies [37, 38], plain DFT predicts negative or near-zero formation energies which contradicts the lack of experimental observation of stable compounds at intermediate Li concentrations (0 < x < 1) for both LixFePO4 and LixMnPO4 that are characterized by a two-phase reaction upon (de-)lithiation and a single voltage plateau [25, 39]. We note that our DFT formation energies somewhat diﬀer from those of Ref. [38], most likely because we use the PBEsol functional while in Ref. [38] the authors used PBE. Remarkably, DFT+U+V correctly predicts positive-valued formation energies and thus unstable LixFePO4 and LixMnPO4 at fractional x, which is in line with previous DFT+U studies [38]. Our HSE06 formation energies for LixFePO4 agree well qualitatively with previous HSE06 studies [38]: they predict stable structures at x = 1/4 and x = 3/4, thus contradicting experiments. It is worth mentioning that for Li1/2FePO4 the lowest-energy structure when using HSE06 is Conﬁguration 2, which is shown as the minimum of the dashed line in the central panel of Fig. S4, and highlights a similar trend to the DFT.

The case of LixMn1/2Fe1/2PO4 is of particular interest. Experimentally it was found that a two-phase reaction occurs in the range 0 ≤x < 1/2, while for 1/2 < x ≲1 the system undergoes a single-phase reaction [39]. For x = 1/2, i.e. at the border of the two regions, there is no clear consensus from experiments although previous DFT+U studies show that this composition lies on the convex hull thus resulting stable [40]. At x = 1/4, the formation energies from DFT+U+V and HSE06 agree remarkably well and both are positive meaning that the structure is unstable in agreement with the experimentally observed two-phase reaction. At x = 1/2, the formation energies from DFT+U+V and HSE06 again agree very well and are both negative meaning that the structure is stable in agreement with Ref. [40]. However, at x = 3/4 the formation energies from DFT+U+V and HSE06 disagree: the former gives a positive value while the latter gives a negative value. In other words, at x = 3/4, HSE06 predicts a stable phase (since it lies on the convex hull) whose existence agrees with the experimentally observed single-phase reaction, while DFT+U+V predicts this composition to be above the convex hull, thus contradicting experiments.

A more thorough study of this structure would require considering all possible arrangements of TM atoms and spins to identify the lowest-energy one. In addition, we recall that here we have neglected the eﬀects from the conﬁguration entropy, the inclusion of which might also inﬂuence the trends for the formation (free) energies.

The horizontal dashed lines correspond to the magnetic moments of the end elements (x = 0 and x = 1). For each material there are four transition-metal atoms, each of which is represented with a bar. Before we proceed to the detailed analysis of Fig. S5, it is useful to compare the computed magnetic moments with the available experimental values. On the one hand, for LixMnPO4, at x = 0 the experimental magnetic moments are not known (to the best of our knowledge), while at x = 1 they are 4.28 [41] and 5.20 µB [42]. These experimental values are largely scattered which complicates a comparison with our theoretical predictions. Nevertheless, from Table I in the main text we can see that both DFT+U+V and HSE06 predict the magnetic moment to be 4.75 µB which falls right between the two experimental values. The predictions by DFT and DFT+U are 4.62 and 4.76 µB,", "page": 26, "position": 1}

On the other hand, for LixFePO4, at x = 0 the experimental magnetic moment is 4.15 µB while at x = 1 it is 4.19 µB [43]. At x = 0, DFT+U+V and HSE06 predict the magnetic moments to be 4.18 and 4.26 µB, respectively, and at x = 1 the magnetic moments are 3.74 from both methods. DFT and DFT+U provide quite similar values (see Table I in the main text). Therefore, at x = 0, the DFT+U+V magnetic moment falls within the experimental range and proves more accurate than HSE06 and other methods considered here. However, at x = 1 the computed magnetic moments are smaller than the experimental ones. It would be important to have novel and more accurate experiments on LixFePO4 to verify whether the trend and values of Ref. [43] are correct and, in particular, whether and how Fe3+ and Fe2+ can assume very similar magnetic moments. Finally, we are not aware of experimental measurements of the magnetic moments in LixMn1/2Fe1/2PO4. Now let us discuss Fig. S5. Our main goal here (as in the main text for Löwdin occupations) is to compare the accuracy of the DFT+U+V approach versus HSE06 for predicting a relative change in magnetic moments upon (de- )lithiation of phospho-olivines. In the case of LixMnPO4, we can see that DFT+U+V and HSE06 agree remarkably well and both show a digital change in the magnetic moments: adding one Li+ ion and one electron to the cathode during the lithiation process leads to the change in the magnetic moment of only one Mn ion (that accepts this extra electron) while all other Mn ions remain unchanged. This process continues when we go on with the Li intercalation until eventually all Mn ions switch their magnetic moments between the values characteristic of their +3 and +2 OS. Thus, these two approaches successfully describe the mixed-valence nature of the LixMnPO4 compound that contains two types of Mn ions, Mn3+ and Mn2+, at x = 1/4, 1/2, 3/4.

In the case of LixFePO4, we ﬁnd similar trends with the diﬀerence that here only DFT+U+V shows a digital change in the magnetic moments while HSE06 features a more gradual change in the magnetic moments of Fe atoms. In full consistency with the previous observations, in LixMn1/2Fe1/2PO4 we ﬁnd that both DFT+U+V and HSE06 predict a digital change of the magnetic moments of Mn ions, while for Fe ions again we ﬁnd that only DFT+U+V achieves a digital switch of the magnetic moments. 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 rc (Å) 0 1 2 3 4 5 Magnetic moment (µΒ) DFT+U+V (Fe 2+) DFT+U+V (Mn 2+) HSE06 (Fe 2+) HSE06 (Mn 2+) DFT (Fe 2+) DFT (Mn 2+) Fe 2+ Mn 2+ (a) 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 rc (Å) 0 1 2 3 4 5 Magnetic moment (µΒ) DFT+U+V (Fe 3+) DFT+U+V (Mn 3+) HSE06 (Fe 3+) HSE06 (Mn 3+) DFT (Fe 3+) DFT (Mn 3+) Mn 3+ Fe 3+ (b) FIG.

Since the magnetic moment is very sensitive to the cutoﬀradius rc of the sphere, we compute it for many values of rc [44] and study its dependence on this parameter. The result is shown in Fig. S6 for the case of LixMn1/2Fe1/2PO4 at x = 1 and x = 0. We can see that the magnetic moment increases steeply as we perform the integration around the transition-metal ion, but quickly reaches a plateau in the interstitial region (O atoms do not contribute signiﬁcantly to the magnetization). For x = 1, the plateau values for Mn and Fe are very close to the nominal magnetic moments of 5.0 and 4.0 µB, respectively, which conﬁrms that both transition-metal elements are in the +2 OS. Interestingly, the plateau values within DFT+U+V and HSE06 are on top of each other, while DFT has smaller values. Moreover, it is useful to mention that the magnetic moments within DFT+U+V and HSE06 increase with diﬀerent rates in the range of rc from 0 to 0.5 Å, which shows that", "page": 27, "position": 2}

For x = 0 the Mn’s magnetic moment plateau value is very close to the nominal value of 4.0 µB (thus conﬁrming the +3 OS of the ion). At x = 0, for Fe the magnetic moment shows a residual dependence on the cut-oﬀradius (determining a slightly “wavy” behavior) all the way to a distance of 2.25 Å from the nucleaus. Most importantly, Fe’s magnetic moment converges to about 4.5 µB which makes the association with the +3 OS less obvious. The diﬀerences between the magnetic moments predicted by various approaches in Fig. S6 (b) are larger than in Fig. S6 (a). Therefore, we can conclude that while the method of Ref. [44] works well for the determination of the OS of transition-metal ions in LiMn1/2Fe1/2PO4, it is less transparent and unambiguous in the case of Mn1/2Fe1/2PO4. For this reason in the manuscript we used the projection-based method of Ref. [45] for the determination of the OS; this in fact worked well in all cases considered in this work. S6.

More speciﬁcally, it shows the eigenvalues of the site-diagonal (I = J) atomic occupation matrix nIσ mm′ of size 5 × 5 [see Eq. (5) in the main text] in the spin-up (σ =↑: λ↑ i ) and spin-down (σ =↓: λ↓ i ) channels, Löwdin occupations n = P5 i=1(λ↑ i + λ↓ i ), magnetic moments m = P5 i=1(λ↑ i −λ↓ i ), and the OS determined using the method of Ref. [45]. By comparing the data in Table S4 with the one in Table I in the main text we can see that the trends are the same.

By comparing the data in Table S4 with the one in Table I in the main text we can see that the trends are the same. In other words, in the mixed olivine LixMn1/2Fe1/2PO4, the occupations n, magnetic moments m, and eigenvalues λσ i are essentially the same as in corresponding olivines LixFePO4 and LixMnPO4. This means that mixing of Mn and Fe atoms in the same olivine compound does not lead to changes in their \"pristine\" electrochemical properties. Therefore, the discussion and the analysis presented in Sec. III.A applies also to LixMn1/2Fe1/2PO4 in exactly the same way. By using the method of Ref. [45], the analysis of the eigenvalues of the atomic occupation matrix in Table S4 reveals that at x = 0 both Mn and Fe are in the +3 OS, while at x = 1 both of them are in the +2 OS. By performing the same analysis at intermediate Li concentrations we ﬁnd that for 0 < x < 1/2 it is the Mn ions that change their OS from +3 to +2 while all Fe ions remain in the +3 OS. On the contrary, for 1/2 < x < 1 it is the Fe ions that get reduced from +3 to +2 while Mn ions remain in the +2 OS (see Fig. 3 in the main text). These results are fully consistent with the fact that Mn3+/2+ redox couple presents a higher reduction potential than the Fe3+/2+ redox couple. S7.

The observations are similar to those presented for LixMn1/2Fe1/2PO4 in Sec. III.B of the main text.

The observations are similar to those presented for LixMn1/2Fe1/2PO4 in Sec. III.B of the main text. For both materials, LixMnPO4 and LixFePO4, DFT fails to predict the correct change in the PDOS during the lithiation process due to SIE, and TM ions change their d states occupation gradually and all together, assuming fractional oxidation states. Conversely, both DFT+U+V and HSE06 show correct trends for these phospho-olivines. More speciﬁcally, when gradually adding Li ions to the materials, we see that only one TM ion at a time changes its OS from +3 to +2 which corresponds to a sudden jump in the (total) occupation of the corresponding Mn-3d or Fe-3d states. The overall similarity of the PDOS from DFT+U+V and HSE06 is striking, even thought, as discussed in the main text, for LixMn1/2Fe1/2PO4 the ﬁne details diﬀer. In particular, the distribution of occupied states near the top of the valence bands is quite diﬀerent within these two approaches: the intensity of the Mn-3d states in the case of LixMnPO4 and of Fe-3d states in the case of LixFePO4 is higher in HSE06, and there is a gap between them at x = 1. It is useful to make a connection between the local geometry changes due to the pseudo Jahn-Teller distortions (see Sec. S3) and changes in the PDOS and atomic occupations. In fact, as can be seen in Fig. S7 for LixMnPO4 at x = 0 there are empty states at around 2 eV above the top of the valence bands that are not present at x = 1. It was shown in Ref. [29] that these empty states originate from the dxz and dx2−y2 states (these are the projections in the global Cartesian framework) in the Jahn-Teller active Mn3+ ion. Since these dxz and dx2−y2 states appear at the same energies, they are likely hybridized [29]. Our DFT+U+V and HSE06 calculations conﬁrm these ﬁndings. Hence, the", "page": 28, "position": 2}

Unfortunately, experimental measurements of band gaps in these materials are relatively scarce, which makes it quite diﬃcult to assess the accuracy of the considered approaches in predicting this quantity. Experimental values of the band gap were only found for LixMnPO4 at x = 1/2 and x = 1 [32], and for LixFePO4 at x = 0 and x = 1 [46–48]. Based on this data we can see that for LixFePO4 at x = 0 the DFT+U and DFT+U+V predictions fall in-between the two experimental values while the HSE06 band gap overestimates both of them. At x = 1 we see that the DFT+U, DFT+U+V , and HSE06 band gaps are all close to the experimental values of Refs. [46, 48], while the experimental value of Ref. [47] is larger by ∼2 eV. Instead, for LixMnPO4 at x = 1 there is a remarkable agreement between our DFT+U and DFT+U+V band gaps and the experimental value reported in Ref.

The DFT+U band gaps at x = 0 and x = 1 for diﬀerent phospho-olivines are generally smaller than the DFT+U+V ones, with a few exceptions when the two match (i.e. at x = 1 for LixMnPO4 and LixMn1/2Fe1/2PO4). Finally, the DFT predictions of band gaps diﬀer notably from those of DFT+U+V and HSE06: at fractional x all materials are predicted to be metallic.

We do not report the DFT+U band gaps at fractional x because of diﬃculties in stabilizing the U values using the self-consistent protocol as explained in the main text (see Sec. III.A). due to the fact that Mn-3d and Fe-3d electrons are overdelocalized due to SIE and hence this leads to the closure of the gap. A very instructive observation that emerges from the comparison of the results for LixMn1/2Fe1/2PO4 with those for LixMnPO4 and LixFePO4 is that for both DFT+U+V and HSE06 the band gap (and its dependence on Li content) is indicative of the speciﬁc TM species that is correspondingly change its OS. In fact, for both these approaches, the band gap values for 0 ≤x < 1/2 are very close to those of LixMnPO4 (in the same range of Li content) while for 1/2 < x ≤1 they resemble those of LixFePO4 for the same values of x. The only exception to this trend is represented by the DFT+U+V band gap of LixMn1/2Fe1/2PO4 at x = 1/2 whose value is intermediate between those of LixMnPO4 and LixFePO4 at the same x. This observation is fully consistent with (and further conﬁrms) the fact that only one TM ion gets reduced at a time, and its 3d orbitals act as the frontier orbitals of the whole system and thus become responsible for its fundamental", "page": 33, "position": 0}
