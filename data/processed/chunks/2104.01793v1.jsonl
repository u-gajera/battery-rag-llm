The wearable EIS system consists of a sensing analog front end integrated with a low-volume (1-5 µL) ultra-sensitive ﬂexible biosensors. A passive sweat sensor was designed integrating glucose oxidase electrochemical system on an active semiconducting material. The non-faradaic EIS response of the biosensor was used to calibrate the analog front end’s response using ratiometric Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) for a shorter measurement time. In this work, a stringent assessment of a continuous glucose sensing platform is performed in a bottom-up approach, going from the biosensor to the system system to the interaction with a human subject. The active semiconductor-based biosensors are dosed with glucose concentrations ranging from 5-200 mg/dL and detection is performed using the analog front end. In addition, detailed analysis of battery life and performance of a wearable EIS system is discussed to deﬁne a ﬁgure of merit for an optimally integrated design. Moreover, a continuous glucose detection test is performed on a healthy human subject cohort to investigate the stability of sensor-system mechanism for an 8-hour period and a time-series based, auto-regressive (AR) model was created for the system.

Introduction There is a signiﬁcant interest in wearable biosensing platforms in the recent times. Constant improvements are being made in developing accurate and robust sensing mechanisms for various biomolecules of interest that demonstrate temporal dynamics. Wearable biosensors are enablers for point of need tracking of chronic conditions and can be beneﬁcial both to the user as well as the healthcare professional in guided therapy1. Glucose is a key biochemical marker with temporal dynamics in context to monitoring chronic health condition of diabetic patients. Current technologies to monitor blood glucose in small and/or wearable form factors still require frequent ﬁnger pricks or needle based interstitial blood glucose monitoring methods such as the Abbott Freestyle Libre or the Dexcom G6 to be integrated with pedometers and other lifestyle management tools towards achieving patient actionable glycemic control. Glucose biosensors, found commercially as well as in literature, implement a microneedle-based, chronoamperometry2–5 and square-wave voltammetry6 biosensor compatible for wearable devices, due to ease of electrical circuit implementation. These sensors may provide good sensitivity at the cost of larger sample volumes of interstitial ﬂuid or sweat to adhere to acceptable CGM standards7. Moreover, due to larger settling time of current, density gradients cause undesirable convective disruption of the diffusion layer8. In addition, large settling time of an amperometric sensing scheme results in relatively higher current consumption. There is an immense opportunity in designing a wearable electronic system towards supporting such point-of-need sensing applications with low-volume, true no-needle insertion mechanisms. A case study of such a system is performed here by coupling a low-volume passive sweat biosensor9 with a rapid response electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS)-based system10. The proposed glucose reporting mechanism utilizes passively expressed system sweat towards achieving quantitative decision making; therefore low sample volume makes it prone to erroneous measurement in a real-world scenario. Error can be deﬁned as a property of the system which introduces a deterministic undesirable offset in the measured outcome of the arXiv:2104.01793v1 [eess.SP] 5 Apr 2021", "page": 0, "position": 1}

On the other hand, noise is a probabilistic property of the system which introduces a random offset in the measured outcome of the system and is modeled as a probability distribution function. The presence of relatively higher noise and error affects the battery performance of a device as it would require more samples to average or ﬁlter out the undesirable signal counterpart. In this work, the sensor’s impedance change is reported and correlated to the conventional statistical methods to establish good sensitivity. Continuous sensing of glucose dose concentration and differentiation of normal and hyperglycemic rate of change of glucose is demonstrated in a healthy cohort of 20 subjects, using an auto-regressive model, in comparison to an interpolated sweat glucose time series. Results Calibration of the system using lumped elements The proposed system was tested for individual channel offset on the calibration channel of a universal dummy cell (Gamry Instruments). Fig. 2 shows the variation of measured impedance of the universal dummy cell using n = 3 replicates of that same system. It is seen that the measured impedance. The accuracy of the device is demonstrated in Fig.2a over n = 3 devices over a single channel. The expected calibration impedance at 100Hz was 4kΩ. However, a systematic negative offset of 50Ωis observed with a variability of 50Ωon the measured impedance. This accounts for a 1.25% inter-device variation along with a −1.25% error. The precision of a single device replicate is observed by taking n = 100 measurements for all four channels using the universal dummy cell. The peak inter-channel variability of 150Ωis observed. Calibration dose response of the system Glucose dose concentrations ranging from 5-200 mg/dL were made in synthetic sweat buffer with pH values 4, 6 and 8 were introduced on a functionalized sensor and the impedance at 100Hz was recorded to demonstrate proof of binding interaction on the sensor surface.

Fig. 3a shows the response of the system as standard error of mean of the percentage change function of impedance impedance to varying pH and dose concentrations with a linear ﬁt. Eqn. 1 shows the mathematical percentage change of the measured impedance used to plot dose response. The system response shows 3% standard error on most of the dose concentrations thus demonstrating precision of measurement. Percentage change in Z = %∆Z = Z −Zbaseline Zbaseline (1) Box-whisker plots were created as shown in Fig 3b to investigate the variability of the system response for a given dose concentration irrespective of buffer pH. The true variability of the sensor response was observed to be 10% inter-sample variation in the form of inter-quartile region height of each of the glucose dose concentrations. It can be observed that even with a larger variability, the median divides the inter-quartile region symmetrically, demonstrating a Gaussian distribution. However, there is a need to model this variation as a mathematical relationship to allow accurate detection as well as differentiation of glucose dose concentrations across the dynamic range. Identiﬁcation of sources of noise and error Noise is an undesirable measured quantity that accompanies a true measured quantity. This introduces an amount of uncertainty in the accuracy and repeatability of the measurement device. Sources of noise have been well characterized for CMOS devices in the past11,12. Primarily, the two major sources of noise discussed in academic as well as industrial design are thermal noise and ﬂicker noise for complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) transistors.

For a non-faradaic electrode-electrolyte interface, the valence of the electrolyte is z. In addition, the measurement is performed for a single frequency, thus the bandwidth of the system is 1 Hz. Fig 1c shows the incremental circuit model established using impedance measurements in Munje et. al.9 and this work. Three noise sources due to Rs, RASA and Rct can be identiﬁed using previously mentioned noise equations. Moreover, the measurement device’s response time of 13 ms is smaller than the biosensor’s response time of 5 minutes. Based on these assumptions14, a noise model was proposed for the biosensor used in this work as shown in Fig. 1d, which was derived from Fig. 1c9 by dividing the cross-section of the sensor in three parts. Since an active semiconducting ﬁlm is a partially conductive ﬁlm with some resistance based on its doping levels, it is prone to a noise voltage similar to a resistor and can be modeled as a thermal noise source. However, considering semi-conducting properties of the ﬁlm in mind15, it can be assumed that there is a presence of 1/ f noise due to this ﬁlm, which is a result of charge carrier generation as well as recombination. However, since a capacitance CASA exists in parallel with the noise sources, this noise can be modeled as a kT/C noise of the active semiconducting ﬁlm. Considering the biosensing electrical double layer and charge transfer resistance, these are modeled to be circuit components for an ideal polarized electrode (IPE), however, they are imperfect in a real scenario. Thus, the noise of this region can be assumed to be a variation in the current", "page": 2, "position": 0}

Considering the biosensing electrical double layer and charge transfer resistance, these are modeled to be circuit components for an ideal polarized electrode (IPE), however, they are imperfect in a real scenario. Thus, the noise of this region can be assumed to be a variation in the current density of the charge carriers depending upon the strength of the electrical potential, which in turn depends on the location of the slip plane. However, since the ion motion is slower than an electron’s motion, a function M(ω) is used to model the frequency dependent effect of this current noise source. The solution resistance is a bulk effect and can be assumed to be a resistor, thus the thermal noise effect. The ﬁnal expression of the noise voltage would be a summation of all these noise sources as given in Eqn. 5. ¯v2 = 4kT(Rs +Relectrode)+2zqI.M(ω).(Rct|| 1 jωCdl )+ kT CASA + K WLCox . 1 f (5) The veracity of this model is conﬁrmed using a noise test for 30 minutes on a non-functionalized sensor surface wet with 1X phosphate saline buffer(PBS) using a high-speed potentiostat (Zurich Instruments, Switzerland). Fig. 2c shows the variation of noise spectra at an interval of 5 minutes. The noise voltage follows a trend inversely proportional the the frequency and is maximum at t=5 minutes, whereas it decreases with time and is at a minimum at t=30 minutes at 100 Hz excitation frequency. Thus, as the introduction of PBS reaches an equilibrium, the noise amplitude of the system start decreasing with respect to 100 Hz excitation frequency. The RMS noise voltage is shown in Fig. 2b.

Thus, the systematic bias will be a constant offset correction where as the standard variable which accounts for variation from external environmental effects in a band limited by %cv. ˆG = G(1+%b+%cv×εn) (6) This approach can be used to characterize sources of variability in system performance. Systematic offset can be observed as a result of device accuracy and precision, offset of the measurement device and speciﬁc signal threshold of the biosensor. Coefﬁcient of variation arises from sample-to-sample variation and is calculated as a ratio of standard deviation to mean for a given dose concentration. In addition, environmental factors such as temperature, relative humidity, variation in volume dispensed, etc. play an important part in the system’s response. However, it would be an extensive effort to characterize for each of them separately and superimpose. A standard normal variable can be used to account for all these variations. Thus, variation is accounted for statistically, whereas systematic offsets are accounted for by observation and nulliﬁed by software when using Eqn. 6.

A simpliﬁed MARD model for the proposed wearable platform was created using sources of error as a percentage component of the device under test in a real world environment in the presence of noise. Such a design comparison is very popular among data conversion designs17 and is deﬁned as the energy required for one data conversion. For deciding an expression for the ﬁgure of merit of a design, the system was split into the measurement device and the biosensor and their inherent properties were observed. For the measurement device, the ultimate objective to be achieved would be very similar to a data conversion system, i.e. achieving a low power consumption per every measurement performed. Similarly, the capability of the device to measure with minimal power will be observed by varying operating conditions. A battery operated device is generally operated at a very low, sleep-mode supply current. However, the device requires a comparatively larger amount of current to operate in an active state. Thus, for such an uneven distribution of current, an average over the time taken by the device to execute the program from start to end. Thus, the battery selection for a ﬁxed average current is performed as follows. Let the sleep current of the device in question is Isleep for time tsleep and the active current of the device is Iactive for time tactive.

However, to demonstrate the increased throughput capacity of the device against power consumption, parameters n and p were included, where n as number of sensors channels available by design and p is the number of points per one measurement cycle. Here, one measurement cycle implies measuring all points until settling for amperometric designs, or one sweep from lowest to highest frequency in impedance spectroscopy designs. For the proposed design, the ﬁgure of merit is calculated for n = 4, p = 10, NBITS = 16, fs = 1 13ms as one conversion period. The voltage is assumed to be 3.7V as of a standard lithium polymer battery. Thus, an FOM of 19nJ/point, or 190nJ/sweep was obtained.

Moreover, it is expected that the biosensor is sensitive to the very low concentrations of biomarkers of interest.

To ensure maximum integrability of the measurement device and the biosensor, an attempt was made to mathematically deﬁne a statistical relationship between sub-block accuracy. Accuracy A of a quantity is deﬁned as the difference between the actual value x of the quantity and the ideal or true value X of the quantity as shown in Eqn. 11. Similarly, mismatch between two quantities x1 and x2 is the difference between the actual ratio of the quantities and the desired ratio of the two quantities as shown in Eqn. 12.

Thus, this speciﬁcation helps a system integrator to analyze the quality of sub-blocks available and investigate methods of error compensation, either by hardware or software. For the proposed system system, for simplicity it is assumed that the since the measurement device and the biosensor are made of different materials, the offsets are uncorrelated, thus additive. The accuracy of the measurement device is 1.25% as per Fig. 2a whereas the accuracy of the biosensor is 10% as per the Fig. 3b.

Also, these models have been created using interstitial ﬂuid (ISF) based continues glucose monitoring systems (CGM), hence these are not based on non-invasively sampled data sets. A more simplistic approach is the application of time-series analysis to measurements provided by the proposed system.

The sweat sample was used to measure sweat glucose levels using a reference method.

However, there has been less interest in design impedance spectroscopy device due to increased complexity required for phase as well as magnitude detection on the hardware aspect. Moreover, added hardware increases the size and power consumption on a system level scale for most designs. Thus, the ﬁrst wearable, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy system is proposed for glucose detection in sweat with a battery lifetime of 215 hours. Moreover, a small form factor of the device is demonstrated by implementing a monolithic SoC with an EIS dedicated front-end with four channel sensing. Table 3 compares the electrical speciﬁcations and system level mechanism in general to highlight the advantages of using an impedance based spectroscopy design over an amperometric design. The proposed biosensor is capable of sensing glucose concentrations in sweat from 10 mg/dL to 200 mg/dL in various synthetic sweat buffers of various pH values. Moreover, the stability of the sensor response is established not only from a conventional statistical approach, but also using sample-to-sample variation observations and demonstrates a 20% variability similar to safe limits on a Clarke Error Grid. In addition, for the ﬁrst time, a semi-quantitative method of detecting rate of change of glucose is proposed for aiding real-time diagnostic efforts using a slope feature extraction algorithm on the impedance response of the sensor. This algorithm also demonstrates a rate-of-change occurrence probability-based reduction in time complexity, leading to low power operation on a wearable platform. From a system level perspective, this work is a ﬁrst attempt to dive into the speciﬁcs of interdisciplinary system integration for biosensing applications. A simplistic noise model for the biosensor is demonstrated along with noise measurements to correlate with change of noise behavior in time based on conventional electrical circuit noise analyses. The analysis is tested against noise measurements made on a high-speed potentiostat and mathematically veriﬁed. In addition, the accuracy of the measurement device is identiﬁed and coupled to a source of error which corroborates", "page": 6, "position": 0}

In addition, the accuracy of the measurement device is identiﬁed and coupled to a source of error which corroborates the MARD based analysis of sample-to-sample variability. Finally, a mismatch expression is proposed to demonstrate low mismatch due to coupling of the biosensor and the measurement device with a mismatch coefﬁcient of -0.875%. Methods Sensor fabrication Fig. 1a shows the cross-sectional view of the chemi-impedance biosensor and the formation of the immunoassay on the functionalized surface. The biosensor substrate is a 100 µm thick,ﬂexible nanoporous polyamide substrate (GE Lifesciences, NJ). Gold electrodes were patterned using shadow mask and deposited using e-beam cryo-evaporator. ZnO thin ﬁlms were sputtered onto patterned in the area between the two gold electrodes to get maximum overlap using an AJA Orion RF magnetron with a 99.999% ZnO target (Kurt J. Lesker) at room temperature9. Materials for implementing glucose assay Poly-amide substrates with 0.2 µm pore size were obtained from GE Healthcare Life Sciences (Piscataway, NJ, USA). The linker molecule dithiobis [succinimidyl propionate] (DSP) and its solvent dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) were ordered from Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc Inc. (Waltham, MA, USA). The monoclonal glucose oxidase antibody was obtained from Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc Inc. (Waltham, MA, USA). Glucose oxidase from Aspergillus niger and D(+)-glucose was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). The glucose antibody was diluted in 1X phosphate buffered saline (PBS, Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc Inc., Waltham, MA, USA). Synthetic sweat was prepared as per the recipe stated in M.T. Mathew et al. The pH range is varied by varying the concentration of the components. Human sweat was purchased from Lee Biosolutions Inc.

Wearable EIS device disassembly The wearable EIS device used for experiments in this work is shown in Fig. 1f. The design is primarily divided into two parts: a mother board and a daughter board. The motherboard houses the integrated circuits required for measurement and communication. The daughter board houses four ﬂexible biosensors using slide-in connectors. The daughter board connects to the motherboard using a slide-in connector as well. The motherboard is further divided into four subsections. The ﬁrst subsection is the ADuCM350 system-on-chip (SoC) (Analog Devices Inc.) which is the heart of the wearable platform. It is equipped with an impedance analyzer block which gives the real and imaginary part of an unknown impedance using a ratiometric discrete Fourier transform (DFT) accelerator. The second subsection is the nRF8001 (Nordic Semiconductor ASA) Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) chip-set which communicates with a mobile application. The third subsection is the temperature and RH sensing which was implemented using HDC1080 (Texas Instruments Inc.). The fourth subsection is the 7/14", "page": 6, "position": 2}

This subsections supplies power to the other subsection either using a lithium battery or USB and manages the charge-discharge cycle of the lithium battery. Glucose sensor experimental protocol Gold surface was functionalized with 3 µL of 10 mmol DSP linker after incubation for 2 hours. The PBS wash was carried out followed by 15 min incubation of 3 µL of 10 µg/mL glucose oxidase antibody. Thereafter, 3 µL of 1 mg/mL glucose oxidase enzyme obtained from Aspergillus Niger is dispensed. Serial dilutions of glucose in synthetic sweat were prepared to range from 5 mg/dL to 200 mg/dL, which were dispensed after antibody incubation. Each glucose concentration was incubated for 5 minutes on the sensor surface prior to measurement. Sensor calibration response was obtained in human sweat with increased glucose concentration doses from 5 mg/dL to 200 mg/dL with n=4 replicates of chips. Two test sample chips with 5 mg/mL and 200 mg/mL glucose concentration doses on each were also measured. The average readings were then compared with the values obtained from calibration dose response in human sweat. These EIS measurements were performed by recording current ﬂow using ADuCM350 after applying 10 mV AC voltage with a frequency of 100 Hz. Human subject enrollment Human subjects for sweat sample collection and on-body continuous measurement in compliance with the protocol approved by Institutional Review Board (IRB) at the University of Texas at Dallas (IRB number 19-146).

The subject will have lunch at T3, and the blood glucose will be observed at T4. A ﬁnal blood glucose measure will be taken at T8 to capture the fall in blood glucose over the duration of experiment. The output of the proposed device and prediction system was validated against the interpolated sweat glucose sample collected separately using a MacroDuct®sweat collector at above mentioned time points. On-body measurement of human subjects A written and informed consent was taken from all participants prior to sample collection. All enrolled subjects wore the devices during the duration of the testing and continuous measurements were recorded in compliance with the protocol approved by the IRB committee. The wearable sweat sensor device was placed on the antebrachial region (lower forearm) of the subject. The human subjects were neither allowed to exert themselves physically nor their skin was excited using a sweat induction method such as iontophoresis. This ensured a full passive generation of sweat to be sampled by AWARE. Continuous on-body measurements sampled every minute for the duration of the testing and depending on the availability of the subject. The concentration proﬁle of the biomarker was reported over the entire time period of recording.
