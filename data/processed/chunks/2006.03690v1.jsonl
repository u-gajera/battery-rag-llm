In contrast, DFT modelling of explicit interfaces in batteries arguably lacks universally adopted methodology and needs further conceptual development. In this paper, we focus on solid-solid interfaces, which are ubiquitous not just in all-solid state batteries; liquid-electrolyte-based batteries often rely on thin, solid passivating ﬁlms on electrode surfaces to function. We use metal anode calculations to illustrate that explicit interface models are critical for elucidating contact potentials, electric ﬁelds at interfaces, and kinetic stability with respect to parasitic reactions. The examples emphasize three key challenges: (1) the “dirty” nature of most battery electrode surfaces; (2) voltage calibration and control; and (3) the fact that interfacial structures are governed by kinetics, not thermodynamics. To meet these challenges, developing new computational techniques and importing insights from other electrochemical disciplines will be beneﬁcial. 1", "page": 0, "position": 0}

INTRODUCTION High energy density batteries are instrumental to vehicle electriﬁcation and to grid storage which helps alleviate intermittency in solar and wind energy generation. Deeper understand- ing of existing materials and the search of new electrode and electrolyte materials are crucial for developing higher capacity, faster-charging, safer, and longer-lasting batteries.1 Battery interfaces are also universally acknowledged to be critical for governing battery rate capa- bility and stability.2 Charge/discharge processes, as well as many side reactions that lead to degradation, self-discharge, and thermal runaway, initiate at interfaces. Electronic structure Density Functional Theory (DFT) modelling of the crystalline in- terior of electrodes, for the purpose of predictng phase stability, equilibrium voltages, and lithium diﬀusion kinetics, has been widely practised for decades.3–7 It provides important guidance to experiments. In contrast, DFT modelling of explicit battery interfaces arguably needs further conceptual development and systematization. Here we distinguish explicit interfaces where two phases are in contact in the same simulation cell, from single-phase DFT calculations used to infer interfacial properties indirectly.8 The present work focuses on modelling methods, oﬀers somewhat pedagogical discussions on the rationale behind the DFT approaches used in our group, and examines future directions and improvements. Simple material interfaces, mainly involving lithium metal, are used as illustrations, but the principles involved should be broadly applicable to other electrodes. Even simple ma- terials exhibit complex interfaces that require substantial approximations; the nature and consequences of some key implicit approximations are highlighted. We restrict ourselves to vanishing current densities.9 This paper is intended to be a topical, critical overview, not a comprehensive review of battery interface DFT modelling.10–12 A useful illustration of the multiplicity of interfacial processes is the ﬁrst charge of graphite anodes used in commercial liquid electrolyte-based lithium ion batteries (Fig. 1a). The “open circuit” potential (OCP) of pristine graphite in organic carbonates, e.g., ethylene carbonate, EC, mixed with salts and cosolvents, is ∼3 V vs. Li+/Li(s) (henceforth this is the reference used unless noted). We stress that OCP is measured by immersing the electrode in the electrolyte over experimental time scale, impling that the interface is well- equilibrated. As charging", "page": 1, "position": 0}

The separator occupies the electrolyte region and is omitted. charges are compensated by an enhanced local concentration of cations in the electrolyte near the interface; the familiar electric double layer (EDL, eﬀectively a dipole sheet) is formed. As the voltage approach ∼0.7 V, graphite acts as an electron emitter — possibly also as an electrocatalyst at its edge site functional groups — and the organic solvent is electrochemically reduced in what will be called “parasitic reactions.” This is because high energy batteries typically operate at voltages outside the electrochemical stability limit of electrolytes.13–15 (Counterions can be reduced at higher voltages, more slowly and to a lesser extent.16–18) The passivating “solid electrolyte interphase” (SEI)10,13,19 grows from these decomposed electrolyte fragments, but e−can tunnel or diﬀuse through the nascent ﬁlm, possibly as part of Li atoms, until later charging cycles.

Li+ does not intercalate into graphite sheets until 0.2-0.1 V (not counting edge sites). This small 0.1 V voltage window has seen the majority of DFT studies,20 in the bulk LixC6 region. By continuity, in this regime, the voltage must be a manifestation of both the graphite electronic structure which changes with x, and the EDL contribution. The SEI continues to grow/evolve in this window. When a LiC6 stoichiometry is attained, the fully charged graphite reverts to an inert electrode, albeit coated with SEI, that may plate lithium metal at negative voltages. Lithium plating is detrimental to battery life and safety. Related processes occur on transition metal oxide cathode surfaces, on which “cathode electrolyte interphase” (CEI) is formed (Fig. 1b); however, the voltage-dependent parasitic reactions there most likely involve species in contact with the surface, just like in water splitting, rather than long-range electron transfer like on the anode. Thus, as our previous overview emphasized,21 batteries interfaces embody the rich physics of mulitple electrochemical devices, and DFT-based battery modelling beneﬁts from bor- rowing from diverse computational disciplines. Electriﬁed liquid/solid interfaces on passive, pristine carbon or platinum surfaces are relevant to electrochemical capacitors and electro- catalysis; these areas have well-established DFT modelling protocols.22–32 Transition metal oxide/liquid interfaces in batteries are in some ways related to electrochemical and photoelec- trochemical water splitting.33–36 Electrodes covered with passivating solid ﬁlms are relevant to breakdown of surface oxide ﬁlms which protect metal surfaces against corrosion, and constructions similar to Fig. 1b have been invoked in corrosion studies.37,38,40 Electroplating studies are also of obvious interest to batteries.121 Passivating ﬁlms on organic-solvent-based battery anode surfaces have inorganic (iSEI) and organic (oSEI) components (Fig. 1b),62 leading to multiple solid-solid interfaces. We argue that it is as urgent to model these comparatively neglected inorganic solid interfaces as the solid-liquid interfaces which have been the mainstay of computational electrochem- istry.

Hence the total number of M atoms should vary with voltage at the interface as well as inside electrodes. We identify three computational challenges somewhat unique to battery interfaces. One is the ubiquity of the aforementioned solid-solid interfaces. Solid surface ﬁlms in which M+ can diﬀuse limit the utility of modelling techniques traditionally used in the liquid state like DFT-based molecular dynamics (also called ab initio molecular dynamics or AIMD).10,51–54 This is because of time scale mismatch: ionic motion and relaxation in solid occur many orders of magnitude slower than liquid state diﬀusion. Another critical issue is voltage determination and control. First we stress that an as- sumption often invoked when modelling explicit battery interfaces, namely that voltages in interfacial simulation cells are determined by the lithium content/energetics, is incorrect. Instead, we adopt the deﬁnition used in other electrochemical disciplines22–30,55 and reconcile it with traditional battery modelling approaches. Using the correct deﬁnitions is necessary to estabilish equilibrium, and to construct simulation cells at overpotentials conditions. Finally, battery interfaces are determined by kinetics, not thermodynamics. Inorganic electrode and electrolyte materials are often sintered for hours at ≥900 oC. A phase diagram, thermodynamics modelling approach suﬃces under those conditions.8 In constrast, interfaces that involve organic solvents are assembled at room temperatures where chemical reactions are slow. Even all-solid-state battery interfaces are usually created at modest (<200 oC) temperatures, where thermodynamic equilibrium does not always apply,56 although ther- modynamic phase diagrams for bulk8 and surfaces57 provide the foundation for kinetics investigations. Thermodynamic (single-phase) calculations are elegant and systematic.8,12 Interfacial kinetics calculations tend to be idiosyncratic. They depend on the realism of the model interface, lattice matching, and other issues common to all interface modelling eﬀorts. Here we focus on issues unique to electrochemical interfaces.

METHODS AND MODELS DFT calculations only deal with half cells because DFT is a ground state theory which supports a single Fermi level (EF). Hence we insert a vacuum region into Fig. 1b, generating two half cells (Fig. 2a). This construction is rigorous for liquid electrolyte systems61 and has been applied in DFT modelling work.31,32 A. Models of Thin-Film-Covered Anode Interfaces Focusing on the anode, the multilayer SEI model62 suggests that inorganic products coat the active anode material, separating it from the thicker, amorphous, and porous or- ganic/polymeric layer outside. The organic SEI is complex, and likely exhibits a low di- electric constant. Its micro- and even atomic-structures are subjects of current studies and debate.63–65 SEI chemical compositions also evolve with time.66,67 To make progress, we replace the outer organic SEI (oSEI), with vacuum (Fig. 2b). This model focuses on the anode active material/innermost inorganic SEI (iSEI) interface, ex- pected to play a main role in blockage of e−tunneling to the electrolyte. Our liquid-free, charge-neutral simulation cells resemble those we use to model all-solid-state battery inter- faces (Fig. 2c).56 In principle, the omitted electrostatic contribution from a liquid electrolyte can be computed using classical force-ﬁeld-based molecular dynamics, but this is not ap- plicable when an organic SEI covers the inorganic ﬁlm. (To give an order-of-magnitude estimate, the liquid EC/vacuum interface exhibits a ∼0.3 V surface potential,55 dwarfed in magnitude by solid-solid interface eﬀects discussed below.) Another approach might be to replace the vacuum in Fig. 2b with implicit solvation.22,27,68 While noble metal-liquid interactions have been calibrated in implicit solvation models, oxide/water or oxide/organic liquid interactions have not. Currently no dielectric solvation model is universally available or uniformally implemented into every DFT code. To enhance reproducibility, we work with vacuum interfaces. The EDL resides entirely within the thin solid ﬁlm regions in our models. Our approach is clearly a limiting-case approximation, to be improved upon in the future. 7", "page": 6, "position": 0}

Kelvin Probe Force Microscopy (KPFM) measurements of voltages in solids share this ambiguity.69 The voltage diﬀerence between cathode and anode does not depend on the cleaved surface provided the two vacuum-solid electrolyte interfaces are identical. Vacuum regions in fact exist in solid electrolytes, inside pores and cracks.70 B. Voltage Deﬁnitions for Metallic Electrodes Unique among electrochemical devices, battery electrodes can emit both electrons and the charge-carrying cation M+. The primary battery functions are charge and discharge, which involve M+ intercalation and exit from electrodes into the electrolyte, accompanied by e−ﬂow in the external circuit. However, as discussed above, e−can also be emitted into (reduction) or captured from (oxidation) the electrolyte, accompanied by local M+ redistribution but not M+ transfer between electrodes. To account for these separate functions, we deﬁne two voltages, Vi and Ve.55 The “ionic” voltage Vi is the canonical deﬁnition in the battery DFT literature.3 It measures the energy gain by inserting an M atom, referenced to M(s)→M(atom): Vi = [(EnM −En′ M)/(nM −n′ M) −µM]/|e|, (1) where EnM is the total energy of simulation cell with an electrode with nM M atoms, µM is the M chemical potential in its bulk metal phase, and |e| is the electronic charge. The entropy change is small in solids and is generally neglected in Eq. 1. Ve is the widely used deﬁnition of voltages in computational electrochemistry; it is Φ=(Evacuum-EF)/|e| modulo a constant, where Evacuum is the vacuum level in the same simulation cell that there Fermi level EF is computed. e−is the prime mover in electrochemistry; potentiostats and voltmeters control and measure e−energy (EF), not M content. Ve is notoriously diﬃcult to deﬁne and control in DFT calculations. For liquid electrolytes associated with corrosion, fuel cells, and batteries, AIMD-based thermodynamic integration approaches have been applied to calibrate the voltage in condensed phase simulation cells without vacuum regions.18,22,25,26,55 (At", "page": 7, "position": 0}

The majority of Ve calculations rely on having a vacuum region (or a quasi-vacuum con- taining an implicit solvent) in the simulation cell. Vacuum is in eﬀect the reference electrode. In periodic boundary DFT calculations, both ﬁnite temperature AIMD23 and T=0 K conﬁg- uration optimization calculations27,31 have used vacuum to compute absolute voltages. The Berry’s phase method, under development for liquid electrolytes,30 can potentially circum- vent the need for vacuum. The relation between voltage referenced to Standard Hydrogen Electrode (SHE), and the work function (Φ), was famously quantiﬁed by Trassati for liquid electrolytes.61 It is Φ minus 4.44 eV divided by |e|. This relation has been incorporated into or used as calibration for implicit solvent formulations of voltage calculations.22,27,29 In cluster-based quantum chemistry and DFT calculations, where only a solute and sometimes a few solvent molecules are surrounded with implicit solvent, calibration is not possible, and the Trasatti relation is directly applied to relate electron aﬃnities (EA) and ionization potentials (IP) to redox potentials.16,74 When the SHE reference is replaced with Li+/Li(s), the shift is changed from 4.44 eV to between 1.37 and 1.40 eV. The O(0.01 eV) diﬀerences are within DFT uncertainties. A metallic electrode is just a large molecule where EA=IP, with the exception that diﬀer- ent facets may have diﬀerent Φ’s which are reconciled by charge transfer and/or geometric considerations.75 The complex organic SEI (Fig. 2a) precludes calibration calculations here. Hence in this and our previous work, we simply assign Ve = Φ/|e| −1.37 V, (2) to electrodes in our overall charge-neutral simulation cells, just like for small molecules, and acknowledge the approximation in omitting the material outside the inorganic solid. Trasatti likely never intended the use of Eq. 2 in vacuum, but one can substitute a low dielectric electrolyte, like argon at low density. We also use this relation for pitting corrosion calculations, where water is optimized at T=0 K. In the future, we will switch to sampling H2O at T=300 K, which is the", "page": 8, "position": 0}

C. i-Equilibrium We deﬁne “i-equilibrium” to be established when Ve=Vi. Rigorously speaking, i- equilibrium is required for comparison with constant-voltage condition experiments. The exact i-equilibrium condition is aﬀected by the accuracy of the DFT functional used, which is neglected herein. Since the two electrochemical potentials follow the relation ¯µM=¯µe−+ ¯µM+ Ve=Vi implies a speciﬁc ¯µM+ in the electrolyte55 which can be used for future calibration calculations. When i-equilibrium is violated, the system is at an overpotential with respect to at least one process. Overpotentials often occur in batteries because M+ and e−motions are generally separated by orders of magnitude in time scales. Experimentally, M+=Li+ relaxation times in cathode materials can be minutes.76 For this reason, we also call Ve and Vi the “instantaneous” and “equilbrium” voltages, respectively. In DFT calculations, Li+ relaxation and motion are far more limited than in experiments because the time scale (if using AIMD) is much shorter, and there is no Li reservoir. Therefore DFT modelling of interfaces is even more susceptable to overpotentials. As long as the “electrode” (a large clump of atoms) is metallic, Ve is instantaneously well deﬁned, even if there are forces on atoms. Vi is in contrast only well-deﬁned when atomic forces are zero at zero temperature, or when the Boltzmann distribution is satisﬁed at ﬁnite T. An incorrect assumption often made45 (including in our early work54) is that simulation cells containing an interface is automatically at “open-circuit” voltage equal to Vi. This ignores the possibility that i-equilibrium can be violated. In fact, Ve is seldom discussed or reported when modelling batteries. The reason is likely historical. The majority of DFT calculations on electrode materials deal with the crystal interior (i.e., they are “single phase”). In the absence of interfaces, the average electrostatic potential in the simulation cell is undeﬁned to a constant77 except in special cases. Hence the absolute EF, which depends the average potential, is also underﬁned — as is Ve via Eq. 2. The only logical recourse then is to assume i-equilibrium.

Grand Canonical Ensemble for e−and Li+ Excess e−surface densities on pristine electrode surfaces vary during charge and dis- charge of EDL capacitors, fuel cell electrodes, and other devices. As a result, mobile ions redistribute at interfaces and EDL’s are modiﬁed. Grand canonical treatments of e−, which permits fractional e−compensated by an eﬀective medium, have been developed for this purpose.22,29 In batteries, charge carriers M+ are also mobile; their concentrations evolve as voltage varies not only inside battery anodes and cathodes, but also at interfaces where there is often less crystalline order. To model changing M+ content calls for Grand Canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) or related methods, in conjunction with electronic structure calculations. AIMD simulations, one of the mainstays in battery interfacial calculations, lack this capability. MC is time-independent and can in principle circumvent the orders-of-magnitude solid-liquid time scale mismatch. In the past, DFT/MC calculations were costly because the global DFT energy was recomputed after each single-atom motion in a MC trial.78 GCMC/DFT- like calculations are being implemented;79,80 they are extremely promising for future studies of battery interfaces. Until such methods become widely available, the interfacial M+ content has to be varied manually or via high-throughput calculations, as it has been done in single phase battery electrode calculations.3,4 Many battery cathode materials are polaron-conducting transition metal oxides with ﬁ- nite band gaps. Rigorously speaking, Ve is undeﬁned such materials (unless surface/interface regions become metallic81); EF is pinned by defect/dopants levels not typically included in the simulation cell, and it cannot be said that all regions of the electrode are at the same voltage. Constant voltage methods which allow fractional e−in DFT calculations22,29 can- not be used because fractional occupancy of transition metal d- or f-orbitals is unphysical. Here one can look to experiments for guidance. In practical batteries, the cathode is a com- posite with active oxides mixed with conductive components. By adding a metallic slab like lattice-matched Au(001) to the bottom of spinel LixMn2O4, one can recover metal-like EF behavior (Fig. 2a).43 Regarding the structure of cathode surface ﬁlms, much less", "page": 10, "position": 0}

Modelling Kinetics and AIMD Simulations At least three general approaches have been applied to model interfacial kinetics in batter- ies: (1) unconstrained AIMD simulations at or near room temperature; (2) high temperature AIMD; (3) barrier predictions. (1) and (2) are both unconstrained and only diﬀer in inten- tion; the former is meant to directly mimic near-experimental and -device conditions while the latter is explicitly understood to artiﬁcially accelerate timescales. Because of the com- putational expense, current AIMD simulations seldom exceed 1 ns in trajectory lengths.52 So unconstrained AIMD trajectories52–54 are at least 1012 times shorter than experimental time scales. M+-motion and bond-breaking reactions revealed in such AIMD trajectories are the initial steps. Even if AIMD predicts that the electrolyte is atomized,52 nucleation of these products to SEI solid phases takes more time. Logically, if a change is observed in an AIMD trajectory, it provides important insights about the mechanism. If no change occurs, it is possible AIMD trajectories are just not long enough. Alternatively, parasitic reactions at interfaces have been examined using AIMD at sub- stantially elevated temperatures.51 This accelerates reaction rates, but extrapolating predic- tions to target conditions (usually room temperature) is non-trivial. This approach can be extremely useful for discovering mechanisms that are subsequently quantiﬁed via barrier- ﬁnding calculations. Reaction barrier calculations like umbrella sampling and metadynamics bypass trajectory length limits at the cost of having to choose pathways.18,82–84 In purely solid state calcu- lations, zero-temperature nudged-elastic-band (NEB) calculations have become standard.85 From barrier calculations, we estimate mean reaction rates using the standard transition state theory expression 1/tave = ko exp(−∆E∗/kBT), (3) where ∆E∗is the activation energy and kBT is the thermal energy at room temperature. At ﬁnite temperatures, free energy barriers (∆G∗) should be used in Eq. 3. We adopt ko=1012/s, within a factor of ten of prefactors used in the literature. Any step in a proposed multi-step reaction mechanisms is considered viable if it is exothermic (∆E<0) and if tave is less than one hour – which translates into ∆E∗<∼1 eV.15 12", "page": 11, "position": 0}

This is an “interface” eﬀect but the ∆Φ magnitude does not decay with distance from the interface. M+ displacement or the transfer of an e−following an electrochemical reaction changes d, Φ, and hence Ve via Eq. 4 in ﬁnite simulation cells. Under constant voltage conditions, ∆Ve should be zero over the course of a reaction. To achieve this condition, constant Ve ensembles86 or extrapolation to large cell sizes87 have been applied in electrocatalysis calculations. Related methods have recently been applied to battery interfaces.88 In some cases, apparent degradation or “disordering” reactions can extend to micron depth beyond the interface89 — far beyond DFT length scales. Fitting reactive force ﬁelds can extend the time- and length-scale associated with the battery interface reaction zone.90 However, spin-dependent reactive potentials have not been devised for transition metal ox- ides. Standard modelling protocols like the “master equation” exist to deal with kinetics- controlled, multistep reactions in catalysis and gas phase reactions.91 So far the complexity of battery reactions has precluded their use. To avoid challenging prospect of calculating all possible reaction mechanisms, whenever possible, we have focused on elucidating the stability of proposed surface ﬁlm components.15 We call this the “surface ﬁlm instability paradigm.” Recent application of artiﬁcial in- telligence to determine locally optimal interfacial atomic structures48 can yield interfaces stable against bond-breaking.

The base model has a 17.28×17.28×36 ˚A3 simulation cell with stoichiometric Li294F144. We conduct a 10 ps AIMD trajectory at T=400 K to equilibrate the interface, and then optimize the ﬁnal MD conﬁguration. The bottom two Li metal layers are held ﬁxed throughout. When an O2 molecule is added to the surface, the c lattice constant is expanded by 4 ˚A. 2×2 Brillouin sampling is used. For the purpose of checking PBE results with the HSE06 functional in this model, Γ-point sampling is employed; decreasing the k-point grid changes Ve by less than 0.12 V. To make connection with corrosion research, Al (111)/α-Al2O3 (0001) interfaces are also considered. No deﬁnitive metal-oxide interfacial structure is known in the experimental literature, and proposed DFT-conﬁgurations with subtle diﬀerences yield signiﬁcant changes in Φ.104,105 This is unlike the weakly interacting and more robust Li-metal/LiF interface. Like Ref. 40, we apply AIMD simulations to equilibrate this interface. Our AIMD is conducted on a primitive surface cell with dimensions 4.81×8.33×50 ˚A3 and Al70O54(H2O)6 stoichiometry. This is the size of a single surface unit cell, chosen to be commensurate with those of Refs. 104 and 105, so that a direct comparison of the respective properties with those work can be made.

Unlike previous DFT work, we add 3 H2O atop each surface Al3+ in an attempt to make surface Al ions 6-coorindated. After a 0.8 ps AIMD trajectory at T=400 K, the system is cooled to T=100 K in 0.15 ps. We ﬁnd that one-third of the added water evaporates/detaches from the surface; they are removed. Another third dissociates into H+ and OH−. The atomic conﬁguration is then optimized at T=0 K, resulting in a conﬁguration where each surface Al is 4-coordinated, and the intact H2O per surface Al lies parallel to the surface, coordinated only to other surface O or OH groups. A 3×2 surface supercell is constructed from this primitive cell and is applied to examine oxygen vacancies with 2×2×1 Brillouin sampling.

In all cases Li and Al metals, softer than ﬂuorides and oxides, are strained to match the ﬂuoride or oxide supercell lattice constants. This changes the pure metal work function by ∼0.1 V. All simulation cells are charge neutral. III. RESULTS A. Lithium Metal in Vacuum Consider a BCC lithium solid cleaved in the (001) direction in vacuum. The cohesive energy is that of Li-metal, and Vi=0.00 V vs. Li+/Li as we remove one entire layer of Li atoms, according to Eq. 1. (The small strain energy is neglected.) The PBE-predicted work function is Φ=3.02 eV, close to the experimental value of 2.93 eV.106 From Eq. 2, Ve=1.65 V vs. Li+/Li(s). Hence the system is out of i-equilibrium, at overpotential against Li dissolution. If there were a Li reservoir and an electrolyte, and Ve=1.65 V were enforced by a potentiostat, the Li slab would completely dissolve. Fig. 3a reinforces this conclusion. A 8 ˚A -thick LiF slab with its (001) facet exposed is located 5 ˚A apart from the Li (001) slab. Neither the Li nor the LiF slab has a net charge or a net dipole moment when isolated.

This ﬁnding cannot be over-emphasized: it is incorrect to assume that Li metal is always at i-equilibrium, i.e., at 0.0 V vs. Li+/Li(s), in an interfacial simulation cell. Experimentally, lithium is stable at or below 0.0 V; when stripping Li under overpotential conditions, Li also exists above 0.0 V. No conclusion about Ve can be drawn from the existence of Li metal in a simulation cell. The same is true of other electrodes, including intercalation and conversion electrodes.

Surface Films Strongly Aﬀect Ve Fig. 3b depicts the conﬁguration obtained after we put the LiF and Li surface slabs in contact. The system develops a large dipole moment, and Φ drops from the vacuum value of 3.02 eV to 1.54 eV. Ve becomes 0.17 V (Eq. 2), much closer to Vi=0.0 V than bare Li (001). The surface ﬁlm brings it close to i-equilibrium — without adding surface charges or liquid electrolyte. Similar, signiﬁcant “contact potential” drops upon adding an inorganic ﬁlm, which reduces Φ (and hence Ve via Eq. 2), have been noted in the corrosion,38 electronics,39, solid electrolyte,43,107 and Li-air battery108 modelling literature. They are partly caused by e−density rearranging within each material at the interface, creating a dipole layer (Eq. 4). 17", "page": 16, "position": 0}

Signiﬁcant contact potentials can also be inferred from experiments,50,69 although they are conducted at less than atomic resolution. We can further reduce Ve to -0.01 V in Fig. 3b (i-equilibrium condition) by manually adding an interlayer of Li atoms directly underneath some of the F−anions at the interface.44 Adding Li atoms in this way is found to be thermoneutral to within 0.05 eV after accounting for Li chemical potential (Eq. 1). It suggests that the energy/voltage landscape at the interface has many similar local minima. This interlayer approach, which reﬂects the grand canonical ensemble environment, is motivated by the “interfacial charge storage” idea.107 Fig. 4b and 4d depict the resulting orbital alignment and electrostatic potential. A ﬁnite band gap remains in the LiF region, and no LiF surface state is occupied. Doubling the LiF slab thickness to 18 ˚A without the Li-interlayer atoms yields a ∆Φ slightly larger by 0.05 eV, leading to Ve=0.22 V. The somewhat diﬀerent Ve partly reﬂects system size eﬀect, but is likely within the uncertainty margin. The Li2O (111)/Li (001) interface yields a contact potential drop of roughly the same size; however, there is small amount of e−leakage to the outer Li2O surface,44 which in reality would have led to further passivation by the organic materials outside. The PBE functional used herein has delocaliza- tion errors111 which may permit unphysical e−leakage from Li metal into LiF. To check that this does not overestimate the contact potential, we also apply the more accurate HSE06 functional to the Li/8-˚A-LiF interface. The resulting ∆Φ is in fact 10% larger than the PBE prediction, showing that our PBE calculations most likely do not exaggerate the contact potential drop. The ﬂatness of the valence band edge (Fig. 4b) emphasizes that we are at “potential- of-zero-charge”-like conditions.

How i-Equilibrium and Ve Aﬀect DFT Predictions Ve is seldom reported or controlled in DFT modelling of battery interfaces. Some reported DFT interface simulations are likely out of i-equilibrium;45,54 they are at as-synthesized rather than battery cycling conditions with well-deﬁned voltages. What are the conse- quences? Ve is crucial for determining the electrochemical equilibrium conditions where M+ inser- tion from liquid electrolyte into metallic electrode is not at an overpotential.55,88,94 The prop- erties under these conditions, e.g., M+ insertion kinetics and barrier, is expected to strongly depend on Ve. Ve is also crucial for passive electrodes acting as e−emitter. The correct Ve value yields redox event onset at the right voltage. In this light, the edge-termination dependence of LiC6 on electrolyte redox behavior in our early work54 is likely the result of the graphite edge sites giving diﬀerent Ve, not computed at that time. Fig. 3c-d qualitatively illustrate this eﬀect by placing a O2 molecule on to the outer LiF surfaces of Fig. 3a and 3b. This example draws on DFT modelling of O2 reduction on Al2O3-coated Al surfaces,40 relevant to the growth of a passivating ﬁlm there, and sidesteps more complex organic molecule redox demonstrations.18,44 When LiF is coated on Li with an “interlayer Li” (Fig. 3b), Ve=0.0 V, and an e−readily transfers through the LiF ﬁlm to the adsorbed O2. Bader analysis110 conﬁrms that a -1.00|e| net charge exists on the oxygen species, i.e., it is a superoxide (O− 2 ). When the Li and LiF slabs are well-separated (Fig. 3a), Ve is much less reductive (1.67 V), and the O2 weakly physisorbs instead. Magnetic moment analysis suggests that O2 is a triplet molecule. Bader analysis yields a -0.31 |e| net charge. The non-integer value is unphysical and is likely due to DFT/PBE localization error111 for this space-separated conﬁguration, which is challenging for DFT methods. In the literature, it has been reported LiF-coated Li metal rapidly decomposes EC molecules in AIMD simulations.53,112 Fig. 3 suggests the reason is that LiF lowers Ve to values which initiate electrochemical reduction.

Ve and electric ﬁelds associated with it should aﬀect charged carriers transport properties.41 Here we use a negative example and examine how Li+ vacancy motion to- wards the metallic electrode aﬀect computed voltages. Again we consider a Li metal slab as in Fig. 3b, with a LiF layer with twice the thickness (∼18 ˚A thick, not shown). Without Li-vacancy, Ve=0.19 V. With a Li-vacancy 10 ˚A from the lithium metal surface, d increases and Ve rises to 0.98 V. When the vacancy is 4 ˚A away from the surface, Ve=0.54 V, still higher than the no-vacancy conﬁguration. Hence the system is not at constant potential during Li-vacancy transport. This is an artifact of the ﬁnite surface area of the simulation cell (Eq. 4). The need to move atoms while keeping Ve constant is known in electrocataly- sis modelling.22,86,87,113 Battery calculations generally have larger lateral surface areas than electrocatalysis and smaller σ (Eq. 4), but d can be much larger unless M+ moves in a high- dielectric liquid electrolyte18,55,88 instead of a relatively low dielectric solid ﬁlm. In general, if there are large changes in Ve along a Li diﬀusion pathway, substantial corrections may be needed to recover the constant potential energy landscape. D. Relation to Atmospheric Corrosion Next we consider contact potential and electric ﬁeld eﬀects on the occupation of orbitals associated with defects. In battery modelling, related studies have been treated mostly at a ﬂat-band level without explicitly considering electriﬁed interfaces.44,118 Because more prior relevant work exists in the Al2O3 literature, we use the Al(111)/α-Al2O3 (0001) interface40 relevant to atmospheric pitting corrosion of aluminum, as example. Of particular interest is the charge state of oxygen vacancies. The “point-defect model” (PDM),37 a widely used approach for predicting passivating oxide breakdown that leads to pitting, proposes doubly positively charged O-vacancies. When Al metal is present in a DFT simulation cell, the charges of defect states are determined by EF and Ve.

As expected, DFT predicts that the H-vacancies carry negative charges, which should be compensated by positive charges on Al metal surfaces in the charge- neutral simulation cell. This raises Ve to a more oxidizing 0.59 V, and raises the local valence band edge near the surface (Fig. 5b). Now creating the same O-vacancy as before yields unoccupied orbital levels above EF (Fig. 5b), and a doubly positively charged defect which dovetails with PDM37 emerges.

Adsorbed halide ions are indeed strongly linked with pitting corrosion onset. The Ve’s constructed for these slabs are too high compared with Al pitting onset voltages. Nevertheless, this slab model appears a promising platform for investigating voltage eﬀects in Al2O3 passivating ﬁlms. Another fruitful connection between battery and corrosion is the possible galvanic lithium corrosion.114 E. The Li(s)/LiOH Interface, a Kinetics Case Study To illustrate the kinetics-controlled nature of battery interfaces, we consider lithium hy- droxide on lithium metal surface. LiOH has occasionally been cited as a SEI component, both experimentally and theoretically.53,62 In Ref. 53, AIMD simulations show that organic solvent decomposes on LiOH (010)-coated Li metal (001) surfaces; the LiOH ﬁlm itself does not react. However, OH groups are expected to give oﬀH2 gas at low voltages.62 Here we explicitly re-examine LiOH stability. First we consider thermodynamics. At T=0 K, both 2LiOH(s) + 2Li(s) →2Li2O(s) + H2(g), and (5) LiOH(s) + 2Li(s) →Li2O(s) + LiH(s) (6) are exothermic, by -1.74 and -1.70 eV, respectively. The reaction H2(g) + 2Li(s) →2LiH(s) (7) is also exothermic by -1.65 eV. H2 gas release is favored by a ∼0.4 eV entropy gain at room temperature over that at T=0 K, but this is insuﬃcient to reverse the exothermicity of Eq. 7. LiH62 has indeed been observed using cryo-TEM,115 although its presence may depend on electrolyte water content.116 Thermodynamically, LiOH solid is predicted to be unstable against lithium metal. Kinetically, both the LiOH ﬁlm and isolated OH−units, which come from reaction with water, are stable within <100 ps AIMD trajectory lengths.53 Here we turn to activation barrier (∆E∗) calculations to extrapolate to longer time scales. Fig. 6a depicts an isolated LiOH unit optimized on the Li (001) surface. In Fig. 6b, the proton is detached to the Li surface, with a favorable ∆E=-1.29 eV released. NEB calcu- lations reveal that ∆E∗=0.72 eV. From Eq. 3, this translates into an average reaction time 22", "page": 21, "position": 0}

We conclude that isolated LiOH is kinetically unstable on Li (001). Next we consider the Li (001)/LiOH (010) interface. Its proposed existence assumes that adsorbed LiOH monomers can nucleate in sub-second time scales before they decompose. The lattice matching is such that all OH groups at the interface are coordinated to surface Li metal atoms (Fig. 6c), unlike LiF and Li2O.44 Breaking one of the three inequivalent OH bonds to form a H−on the lithium metal surface releases ∆E=-0.79 eV, favorable for reaction. The barrier is ∆E∗=1.27 eV, which indicates a reaction exceeding experimental time scales. The other two inequivalent OH groups at the interface exhibit ∆E=-0.60 eV but ∆E∗are similar at 1.20 eV. If one were to deposit Li vapor on defect-free LiOH (010), reactions are expected only at elevated temperatures. However, the above calculations ignore the grand canonical nature of the interface dur- ing cycling. A metastable conﬁguration can be created by adding a Li atom to the sur- face (Fig. 6d). ∆E′ is 0.22 eV after accounting for lithium chemical potential. From this 23", "page": 22, "position": 0}

Accounting for ∆E′ but not zero point energy (ZPE) that further reduces ∆E∗in proton transfer reactions,58 the energy at the transition state is 0.98 eV above that of Fig. 6c. From Eq. 4, this is one reaction per 8 hours at T=300 K. Without mapping out all possible reac- tion paths via the master equation,91 DFT/PBE calculations predict at least one pathway whereby that a pristine LiOH (010) slab should react with lithium metal on an experimen- tally observable time scale, likely forming Li2O on Li metal surfaces. We conclude that the LiOH SEI component seen in experiments are likely not in contact with Li metal. It is more likely lodged on other, more stable SEI components such as Li2O. Thus AIMD simulations of liquid or solid electrolyte decomposition on Li metal surfaces are extremely useful for giving qualitative insights about possible reaction mechanisms, especially at the initial stages of interfacial degradation reactions. But they currently cannot rule out that reactions can occur at >1 ns time scales. 24", "page": 23, "position": 0}

Voltage and Electric Field Eﬀects on Kinetics This LiOH (010) example permits an in-depth exploration of the eﬀect of Ve on ∆E and ∆E∗associated with parasitic reactions. Fig. 6c, d, and e are consistent with Ve=0.42 V, 0.46 V, and 0.45 V, respectively. Unlike the LiF interface (Fig. 3a), all O atoms at the surface are coordinated to Li metal atoms, and attempts at adding an interlayer like in Ref. 44 fail to lower Ve. To achieve i-equilibrium (Ve=0.0 V) requires cations outside the LiOH slab to reduce d via Eq. 4. Here we take an opposite approach. Motivated by our Al2O3 analysis (Fig. 5), we create a H vacancy at the LiOH outer surface (Fig. 6f). As expected, DFT calculations yield a negatively charged H-vacancy in the neutral cell, which makes d more positive in Eq. 4 and increases Ve from 0.42 V to 2.17 V while Vi remains 0.0 V. The system is now at a signiﬁcant overpotential with respect to Li dissolution from the anode. The valence band edge shown in Fig. 7 suggests a signiﬁcant electric ﬁeld of ∼0.22 V/˚A. Remarkably, ∆E and ∆E∗are almost unchanged. They are now -1.09 eV and +0.77 eV, within 0.02 eV of the values at Ve=0.46 V. This is despite the fact that Bader charge analysis suggests the H transferred to the surface now has a −2.1 |e| charge (i.e., it is a hydride). In electrocatalysis modelling, |e— times changes in Ve (designated as “U”) is often added post-processing to ∆E on metal surfaces in reaction steps that involve e−transfer, and ∆E∗ have larger ﬁeld-dependence.60 In Fig. 6, an added ±|e|Ve should emerge in ∆E only if a charged species transverse the entire solid state EDL. The lack of change in ∆E∗is however unusual, and may reﬂect strong metal surface screening. Other parasitic reactions on Li metal we have considered, like those at the Li/LiPON56 (oxy-phosphorus nitride inorganic polymers) and Li/Li2CO315 interfaces, exhibit similarly small voltage dependences until the ﬁeld strengths imposed by localized defects are suf- ﬁcient to initiate diﬀerent degradation mechanisms that involve long-range e−transfer.15 Experimentally, it", "page": 24, "position": 0}

CONCLUSIONS AND OUTLOOK In this work, we apply simple examples with explicit model electrode/surface ﬁlm in- terfaces to illustrate some key challenges speciﬁc to electronic structure DFT modelling of interfaces in high energy density batteries. These include voltage calibration/control, the thin-ﬁlm covered (“dirty”) nature of electrodes in monovalent cation (M+) batteries where M=Li or Na, and the fact that interfaces are kinetics-controlled. We ﬁnd that contact potentials at metal-solid electrolyte interfaces, which can only be computed with explicit interfaces in DFT models, cannot be neglected in understanding the voltage proﬁle across interfaces. The ionic (“open circuit”) voltage Vi, which implies equilibrium conditions, and electronic (“instantaneous”) voltage Ve, must be distinguished. These two quantities determine whether interfaces are at equilibrium, and enable modelling of interfaces at over- potential conditions. Ve is shown to govern long range transfer and electric ﬁelds that modify transport properties. It appears to play little role in chemical reactions where reactants are in direct contact with lithium metals anodes. However, the roles of voltage and electric ﬁelds on reactions at other battery interfaces need further clariﬁcation. The surface-ﬁlm covered nature of electrodes is not an inconvenience; it is a major part of the interfacial physics of batteries, and should be regarded as a new basic science paradigm and opportunity. In contrast, modelling pristine metal electrode surfaces of M+ batter- ies, is mainly relevant to the initial stages of battery assembly. Unconstrained ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations cannot conclusively prove the stability of interfa- cial components because trajectory lengths are 12 orders of magnitude shorter than battery operational time scales; barrier ﬁnding computational techniques are needed to understand kinetics-controlled interfaces. The M+ content across the entire interface follows the grand canonical ensemble. Cathode interfaces are challenging because of the polaron-conducting nature of cathode materials. Borrowing from other branches of computional electrochem- istry like corrosion, supercapacitors, and electrocatalysis presents good opportunities for advancing the current state of battery interface modelling.

The latter areas have been subjects of modelling overviews, while a critical review of modelling methods has been lacking. The unifying modelling concepts discussed in this work focus on metallic conductor electrodes and reasonably well- characterized surface ﬁlms or solid electrolytes. These should be broadly applicable to all battery electrodees like Na anodes, lithiated graphite, and lithiated silicon. One exception is multivalent (e.g., Mg) batteries, where surface ﬁlms have been avoided to prevent slow multi- valent ion transport. Li-S battery apply Li-metal cathodes and often carbon-based cathodes that trap sulfur; these electrodes are metallic and contain surface CEI ﬁlms too. Carbon cathode/Li2O2 interfaces in Li-air batteries also ﬁt this category. All-solid state with metal- lic anodes would be prototype systems to apply these computational ideas, but the thicker solid electrolyte compared to surface ﬁlms in liquid electrolyte batteries may require special treatment (e.g., those devised for DFT modelling of Mott-Schottky contacts) address the larger space charge region. Computing overpotential eﬀects on kinetics in kinetics-limited conversion cathode materials may be a particularly fruitful area to apply our approach; the calculations of reaction barriers at non-overpotential conditions require careful tuning of the electronic voltage at the interface. Interfaces between transition metal oxide cathodes and liquid electrolytes may present the most signiﬁcant challenges. While the non-metallic nature in many such oxides can be circumvented with by adding a computational “current collector” at the bottom, the very thin surface ﬁlm (“CEI”) covering oxide surfaces, which has mostly unknown atomic structures, hinders assignment of voltages and predictions of degradation and transport reaction kinetics. In the ﬁnal analysis, at this and all other battery interfaces, the voltage is an imposed, DFT-constructed quantify; the question is whether model interfacial structures that provide the imposed voltages yield electric ﬁelds that reﬂect experimental conditions.
