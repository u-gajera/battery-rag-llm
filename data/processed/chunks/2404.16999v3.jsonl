Unfortunately, at present, vdW heterostructures are restricted to a small number of stackable layers, due to the weak vdW forces holding adjacent layers together. In this work, we report on computational studies of a bulk vdW material consisting of alternating TiS2 and TiSe2 (TSS) vertically arranged layers as a potential candidate for anode applications. We use density functional theory (DFT) calculations and ab-initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations to explore the effect of high entropy on several electrochemically relevant properties of the bulk heterostructure (TSS-HS) by substituting Mo6+ and Al3+ at the transition metal site (Ti4+). We also study the solvation shell formation at the electrode-electrolyte interface (EEI) using AIMD to determine Li-coordination. Based on the properties computed using DFT and AIMD we propose that high entropy TSS-HS (TSS-HE) might possess improved electrochemical performance over standard TSS-HS. Factors that could improve the performance of TSS-HE are 1) Less structural deformation, 2) Strong bonding (Metal- Oxygen), 3) Better electron mobility, 4) Wider operational voltage window, and 5) Faster Li-ion diffusion. Our observations suggest that ‘high entropy’ can be an effective strategy to design new anode materials for improving electrochemical performance of Li-ion batteries.", "page": 0, "position": 0}

These strategies include doping,7, 8 strain,9, 10 defects,11, 12 or heterostructures with different layered materials.5, 13 In this regard, heterostructures are an attractive alternative that have already shown great promise. The distinct layers of heterostructures are held together by interlayer van der Waals (vdW) interactions. These heterostructures not only exhibit new basic physics,14, 15 but have also shown considerable performance in applications such as field-effect transistors13, 16, 17 and photodetectors.18-20 Additionally, there is a plethora of literature focusing on the virtues of graphene-like heterostructures used as electrode materials.21-23 Some promising post-graphene candidates are transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs),24-27 phosphorene,28 and silicene.29 The layered TMD materials not only have properties similar to graphene, but they also have many mechanical, optical, chemical, thermal, and electrical capabilities that are comparable to or superior to graphene.27, 30, 31 The weak interlayer dispersion interactions in TMDs or their heterostructures facilitate intercalation of foreign atoms (such as Li-ions) which is reported to improve the electron conductivity of the material.32 Hence, layered TMDs and their heterostructures have previously been proposed as promising anode materials for LIBs.33, 34 Commonly, a vdW heterostructure is prepared by mechanically stacking one two-dimensional (2D) layer on top of another. Interestingly, some bulk vdW heterostructures exist in nature, like Frankencite, which is a naturally occurring vdW heterostructure composed of SnS2 and PbS layers stacked alternately.35 There are few examples of such bulk vdW heterostructures, and synthesizing such heterostructures remains difficult despite the advancements in 2D materials research. Another example of a bulk vdW heterostructure is the 6R-phase of TaS2, which consists of alternating layers of 1H-(superconducting)36, 37 and 1T-TaS2 (Mott insulator)38.

Considering the difficulty in synthesizing heterostructures it is of value to first consider potential materials in silico. Here we focus on the heterostructures with ‘high entropy’ elemental configuration. The study of high entropy battery materials commenced with the development of high entropy metal oxides as LIB anodes that showed significant improvement in specific capacity and capacity retention.47-49 This direction was further expanded to high entropy Li-ion cathodes that showed improved electrochemical performance.50, 51 We note that the terms ‘high entropy’,", "page": 1, "position": 1}

Under ideal mixing conditions, where components are randomly distributed, the configurational entropy is expressed as:52 𝑆𝐶𝑜𝑛𝑓𝑖𝑔 𝐼𝑑𝑒𝑎𝑙 = −𝑘𝐵∑𝑥𝑖𝑙𝑛𝑥𝑖 𝑁 𝑖=1 (1) where 𝑥𝑖 indicates the mole fraction of component i on the site of mixing. To be considered high entropy, a material must have an 𝑆𝐶𝑜𝑛𝑓𝑖𝑔 𝐼𝑑𝑒𝑎𝑙 value of ≥1.5𝑅.53 For instance, the traditional cathode material 𝐿𝑖𝑁𝑖0.5𝑀𝑛0.3𝐶𝑜0.2𝑂2, has an 𝑆𝐶𝑜𝑛𝑓𝑖𝑔 𝐼𝑑𝑒𝑎𝑙 of 1.03𝑘𝐵 per transition metal, and therefore cannot be considered a ‘high entropy’ material.54 High-entropy materials can produce a large ensemble of local environments instead of the formation of local homogenous domains with clusters of like atoms which can form in low-entropy materials. Studies have indicated that multi-ensemble local environments might reduce the short-range ordering which is one of the causes of impaired electrochemical performance. Reduced short-range ordering enables ‘high entropy’ materials to attain higher rates and capacities.51, 55 In addition, compared to low-entropy materials, high-entropy materials show a greater tolerance for lattice distortions, allowing for significant changes to the energy landscape for ion diffusion. As recently demonstrated in high-entropy oxide-based materials, carefully designed lattice distortions can produce percolating diffusion routes, allowing orders of magnitude increase in ionic conductivities.56 In this work, we studied the effect of high entropy on structural, electronic, bond strength, and electrochemical characteristics of a typical bulk heterostructure anode TSS-HS using DFT and AIMD calculations. Additionally, we explored Li-ion diffusion at the anode-electrolyte interface. Our analysis suggests that high entropy TSS-HS anode materials can improve overall electrochemical performance and warrant further experimental study. Computational Methods Using DFT, we performed high-throughput calculations on pristine and high entropy 1T-TiS2-TiSe2 (TSS) bulk heterostructure (HS) to explore its potential as a layered anode material for Li-ion batteries. To meet the ‘high entropy’ criteria, i.e., N≥5, we substitute Mo and Al at the transition metal site (Ti). Several Ti-substitution sites were explored using DFT to find suitable spots for Mo and Al in TSS-HS. Using equation (1), we obtained 𝑆𝐶𝑜𝑛𝑓𝑖𝑔 𝐼𝑑𝑒𝑎𝑙=1.44𝑘𝐵 per component for our TSS-HE anode model.

Spin-polarized calculations were carried out with a 5×5×2 k-mesh. Grimme's D3 dispersion correction 64 was used to treat van der Waals interactions. For the analysis of delithiated states of TSS-HS and TSS-HE, Monte Carlo simulations were performed to identify the preferred Li-ion sites at various Li-concentrations (that is, for lithiated to fully delithiated states: 100.0, 87.5, 75.0, 67.5, 50.0, 32.5, 25.0, 12.5, 0.0). Using the Ising model, we generated 20,000 initial guess ground state magnetic configurations for the TSS-HS and TSS-HE systems for the DFT calculations. The lowest three of the 20,000 potential spin configurations were taken into consideration for DFT calculations. The lowest energy structure obtained using DFT was considered for final calculations and analysis. We found that TSS-HS prefers a ferromagnetic state, while TSS-HE prefers an antiferromagnetic state as the ground state magnetic ordering. For the plane-wave basis set, we employed a 520 eV kinetic energy cut-off. In geometry optimizations, the force per atom convergence criterion was 0.01 eV∕Å, whereas the convergence criterion for self-consistent field electronic structure computations was 1×10-5 eV. To determine the strength of metal-anion bonds at various Li-concentrations (metal=Ti, Mo and Al; anion=S and Se), we performed partial crystal orbital Hamiltonian population (pCOHP) analysis using the LOBSTER package.65-68 Maximum bond distances between Ti-S/Se, Mo-S, and Al-Se were between 1-3 Å for the pCOHP calculations. This analysis provides clues regarding the ‘high entropy’ effect on structural deformation of the TSS under the effect of Li-extraction. Furthermore, to obtain the voltage profile of Li-(de)intercalation of TSS-HS and TSS-HE, the following expression was used:69-71 𝑉= − [𝐸(𝐿𝑖𝑥+𝑑𝑥𝑇𝑆𝑆) −𝐸(𝐿𝑖𝑥𝑇𝑆𝑆)] 𝑑𝑥 + 𝐸(𝐿𝑖𝑏𝑐𝑐) (2) Here, 𝐸(𝐿𝑖𝑥+𝑑𝑥𝑇𝑆𝑆) and 𝐸(𝐿𝑖𝑥𝑇𝑆𝑆) are the energies per formula unit of TSS-HS (or TSS-HE) at 𝑥+ 𝑑𝑥 and 𝑥 Li-concentrations.

These simulations demand significant computational resources, and therefore we used a reduced 3×3×2 k- mesh.74 The canonical ensemble (NVT) with the Nose-Hoover thermostat as a heat bath was employed.

All other sites have relative energies, Δ𝐸≳ 1.0 eV. For further calculations site-1 was considered for Li- intercalation, and 100% Li-coverage was used for fully lithiated layered anode materials.

In Fig 3a, ‘a’ exhibits a pronounced decreasing trend with lithiation (that is, charging) up to 50% Li- concentration in TSS-HE, while subsequent lithiation (Li>50%) results in a smaller reduction in ‘a’. In TSS-HS, ‘a’ shows a continuous, albeit somewhat erratic, shrinkage as a function of Li-concentration, which overall is greater than for the high entropy material. We ascribe this shrinkage to reduced intralayer repulsion between metal ions as they are reduced.

Figure 3: Relative change in (a) ‘a’ lattice parameter, (b) ‘c’ parameter and (c) volume of TSS-HS and TSS-HE as a function of Li-concentration. Similar trends were observed in volume change as well (Fig 3c). Suppressed structural deformation attributed to ‘entropy-stabilization’ during dis-charging has been reported by several groups.50, 81 Low lattice deformation may offer enhanced specific capacity as well as prolonged electrochemical cycling. 2. Electronic Structure We performed electronic structure calculations to analyze the effect of ‘high-entropy’ on the electronic structure and electron-mobility in TSS anode materials. Partial density of states (PDOS) obtained for HS and HE at different Li-concentrations are provided in Fig 4, S1 and Fig 5, S2, respectively. Initially at Li-0%, TSS-HS have Ti4+ ions which consists of zero unpaired d-electrons, thus contributing no magnetic moment. This can also be observed in the Li-0% PDOS, where the spin-up and spin- down channels have identically occupied energy levels. The majority of the Ti4+-d states are found in the conduction band region and no-energy gap is present. Upon lithiation of TSS-HS, the Ti-ions commence redox-activity, that is Ti4+ ions are reduced to Ti3+ ions. Ultimately all Ti4+-ions are reduced to Ti3+ ions at the Li-100% level. We see that the Ti4+-d states are shifted down in energy upon Li-insertion as these ions are being reduced. The Ti3+ ion have an unpaired electron, and hence a non- zero magnetic moment is obtained for the Ti3+-d states, which are located across the energy spectrum. As expected, Se-p states are observed near the Fermi level,", "page": 6, "position": 0}

The dotted line indicates that the Fermi level was set at 0.0 eV. The high-valent dopant (i.e., Mo6+) in TSS-HE adds conductive states into the Fermi level region, resulting in a zero-band gap at the 100% Li-level. This may offer improved electron mobility in deep charged states resulting in better conductivity. 3. Redox Activity and Bond Strength In the PDOS analysis, we found that Ti-ions are redox-active, while the chalcogen- and dopant ions do not change their oxidation states during lithiation. For a closer look at the redox activity of the Ti-ions with Li-concentration, we performed redox population analysis for TSS-HS and TSS-HE anode materials. In both TSS-HS and TSS-HE pristine (discharged) states, all Ti-ions are found in a Ti4+ oxidation state (Fig 6). In TSS-HS Ti3+ begin to appear at Li-25.0%, while in TSS-HE Ti3+ emerge at Li- 37.5%. In TSS-HS, all Ti4+ are consumed by Li-87.5%, while for TSS-HE this only occurs at Li-100.0%. Hence, the onset of Ti-reduction is shifted slightly to greater lithiation levels in the high entropy material. We note that the presence of Ti4+ ions is important to maintain a consistent and strong bonding environment with surrounding Se and S ions. Additionally, it has been reported that Mo6+ and Al3+ ions offer strong bonding with surrounding anions which can lead to improved material stability.50, 63, 83, 84", "page": 8, "position": 0}

Values of ICOHP (y-axis) are obtained as the integrated COHP at the Fermi Level. To quantify the strength of chalcogen-metal bonds in the TSS materials, we performed integrated COHP (ICOHP) analyses, where more negative ICOHP values indicate stronger bonds. The ICOHP as a function of Li-concentration can be seen in Fig 7 (a) and (b) for TSS-HS and TSS-HE anode materials, respectively. From Fig 7 we observe that Ti-S and Ti-Se bonding is weakened with lithium insertion for both TSS- HS and TSS-HE, which may be attributed to Ti4+ → Ti3+ reduction. However, in Fig 7(b) we see that the dopants Mo6+ and Al3+ form much stronger bonds with surrounding chalcogen ions. This could be a factor in preventing structural deformations with lithiation in TSS-HE. 4. Open Circuit Voltage Profile In designing high-performance LIBs, open circuit voltage (OCV) is a crucial factor for the development of high energy density batteries. Using equation 2, OCV profiles (Fig 8) were obtained using the ground-state energies of TSS-HE and TSS-HS at each delithiated state. 50 . A wider operational voltage window (~0.47 V) was achieved for TSS-HE compared to TSS-HS (~0.40 V) which may lead to higher capacity as more Li+ ions can be extracted with a larger voltage window.

Interface properties Prior to studying the Li diffusion behavior at the EEI, the structural evolution and Li diffusion in a model electrolyte (EC, PC, and PF6-) was analyzed by computing the integrated radial distribution function (IRDF) (Fig 9(a,b)). We considered relatively short simulations 85-87 to establish basic qualitative trends relating to ion-transport in TSS-HS and TSS-HE at the EEI. Our IRDF analyses show that Li+ ion coordination with surrounding molecules in the electrolyte is slightly reduced in the TSS-HE- electrolyte complex (Fig 10(b)) compared to the TSS-HS-electrolyte (Fig 9(a)), with values of 1.90 to 1.33 (Li-O (EC)) and 1.05 to 0.65 (Li-O (PC)), respectively, within an interaction distance of 3Å. Reduced coordination of Li ions can offer better mobility near the EEI and thus might result in better diffusion.
