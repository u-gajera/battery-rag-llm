Abstract: Polymer additives [like polyethylene oxide (PEO)] are widely used for smooth electrode deposition in aqueous zinc and a number of other battery systems currently investigated for energy storage applications. However, the precise mechanism by which they regulate morphology and suppress dendrite formation remains unclear. In this study, we address this knowledge gap by using in-situ electrochemical atomic force microscopy (EC-AFM) to directly observe the interfacial evolution during Zn electrodeposition and polymer adsorption on copper (Cu) substrates in the presence of varying concentrations of ZnSO4 and PEO. Contrary to previous literature assumptions which emphasize the binding to the growing Zn crystal surfaces or Zn2+ ions, our results demonstrate that PEO smooths Zn films by promoting nucleation of (002)-oriented Zn platelets through interactions with the Cu substrate. Density functional theory (DFT) simulations support this finding by showing that PEO adsorption on Cu modifies the interfacial energy of Zn/Cu/electrolyte interfaces, favoring the stabilization of Zn (002) on the Cu substrate, as well as", "page": 0, "position": 0}

These findings elucidate a novel design principle for electrode smoothing, emphasizing the importance of substrate selection paired with polymer additives that exhibit an attractive interaction with the substrate, but minimal interaction with growing crystals, offering a mechanistic perspective for improved battery performance. Introduction The use of surfactants to modify interfacial free energies, enabling smooth interface growth, is well-established in vapor phase systems.[1–3] However, it remains uncertain how the concept works in solution-based electrochemical systems, which are essential across numerous technological fields – most notably in battery technologies, as well as in manufacturing processes of solution- based thin film deposition for organic solar cells, microelectronic devices, and even in geochemical systems where inorganic films heterogeneously form on mineral grains within reservoirs.[4–6] In the case of batteries, metal anodes such as zinc and lithium have attracted wide attention due to their high energy density but maintaining a flat interface has been a persistent challenge.[7–9] Most attempts have been Edisonian in nature, with a limited fundamental understanding of how to design these anodes to achieve a flat morphology that avoids dendrite formation resulting from these efforts. While several studies have explored the influence of electrolyte compositions on smoothing Zn or Li electrodeposits, and a few have investigated ways to control morphology by manipulating epitaxial relationships to promote the growth of flat-lying crystals, there remains a lack of comprehensive knowledge on how surfactants or polymer additives might impact or regulate electrode morphology.[10–19] A previous finding suggests that the addition of a commonly used polymer additive, polyethylene oxide (PEO), can enhance the performance of Zn anode batteries, pointing to the potential of an interface smoothing mechanism similar to those observed in vapor-phase systems (Fig. S1).[20] From a synthetic perspective, one might expect PEO to adsorb onto various growing Zn crystal faces, thereby altering surface energies and facet-dependent growth rates to influence the Zn film morphology.[21,22] However, using real-time in situ observations of both interfacial evolution during Zn electrodeposition on Cu and the process of PEO adsorption on both the Cu and the Zn, we show that this", "page": 1, "position": 0}

PEO does not interact with the growing Zn crystal surfaces to modify their morphology, rather it does indeed act as a surfactant by interacting specifically with the Cu substrate and modifying the interfacial solution structure. PEO-Cu binding modifies the interfacial free energy and confines ion distributions to a narrow interfacial zone, thereby promoting the nucleation of flat-lying (002)-oriented Zn platelets and preventing the random distribution of crystal orientations that typically cause surface roughening and eventual interface breakdown. Moving beyond previous concepts, such as polymer binding to Zn2+ cations to adjust Zn2+ distributions or to the growing Zn crystals to modify their surface energies, this study introduces a novel perspective and leads to a design principle for suppressing dendrite formation and mitigating interface roughening.[17,20,23–31] Specifically, it provides mechanistic", "page": 1, "position": 1}

In the absence of PEO, Zn platelets were observed to form with a range of crystallographic orientations leading to a rough interface (Fig. 1a). However, the results show that, in the presence of 0.1 wt% PEO (M.W. 100,000), the electrode surface remains much smoother due to a sharp increase in the ratio of parallel-to-inclined Zn plates. The morphology and statistical analysis of plate orientation for Zn electrodeposited in 0.1 M ZnSO4 in the absence of PEO show that the Zn plates exhibit a wide range of orientations with 75% of the plates inclined at an angle >30° (Fig. 1a). In contrast, upon the addition of a small amount of PEO (0.1 wt%), the morphology was significantly altered. Although some inclined plates still formed, often in the form of a “desert rose”, Zn plates oriented parallel to the Cu substrate were dominant. Analysis of the plate orientations shows that three are most common: flat-lying with Zn (002) parallel to the substrate, inclined such that Zn (101) forms the interface with the substrate, and vertical for which Zn (100) lies perpendicular to the substrate (Fig. 1c, d, e). Statistical analysis of the Zn plate orientations for the two cases shows that the ratio of Zn (002)-oriented to Zn (101)- and Zn (100)- oriented increases from 1:3 before adding PEO to 3:2 after (Fig. 1a, b). For the Zn (002)-oriented plates, once the first layer of plates forms, subsequent layers (highlighted by red circles in Fig. 1c) use the first one as a template to continue growing plates that are parallel to the Cu substrate. The same is true of the inclined and vertical Zn plates; the second and third layers also adopt the first layer as a template and stack into multilayers (highlighted by blue circles in Fig. 1d).

Thus, if it interacts with the Zn crystal surfaces, the interactions are weak and neither adversely affects the delivery of Zn2+ to the electrode surface, nor significantly alters Zn surface energies. In contrast, the increased ratio of the parallel-to-inclined Zn plates implies that PEO biases the orientation of the initial nuclei, which determines the orientations of the resulting plates. Thus, we hypothesize that PEO primarily interacts with the Cu substrate to adjust the interfacial structure of the Cu/electrolyte interfacial region and alter the interfacial energies of the Cu/Zn/electrolyte interface.", "page": 3, "position": 1}

The adhesion force map was recollected in the same region after the solution was fully replaced by 0.1 M ZnSO4 (Fig. 2c). The adhesion force remained weak and was also evenly distributed. The adhesion force map changed significantly once 0.1 M ZnSO4 solution with 0.001 wt% PEO was introduced into the cell. The appearance of regions exhibiting higher adhesion force (lighter areas in Fig. 2d), demonstrates extensive polymer adsorption on the Cu surface. To better interpret the CFFM data, single-point adhesion force curves were collected during CFFM at points within and away from the regions of adsorbed polymer seen in the CFFM images (see points A and B highlighted in Fig. 2d). The divergence of the approaching and retracting force curves at point A, which is within the region of polymer adsorption, is characteristic of a sticky surface. (As an AFM cantilever is retracted from a sticky surface, the probe remains adhered until the tensile force is large enough to cause a jump from contact, leading to a negative peak in the force curve). Based on the magnitude of the peak, we estimate an adhesion force of around 4 nN (Fig. 2e).[33,37] In contrast, the approaching and retracting force curves at point B, where no polymer is seen in the CFFM images, overlap well (Fig. 2e) demonstrating that point B is on the hard Cu surface where polymer adsorption is absent (Fig. 2f).[33,34] From a statistical analysis of 16,384 force curves collected in three force maps over a 128 × 128 grid of points, we obtained the relative frequency distribution of adhesion forces on Cu substrates in the three liquid environments: water, 0.1 M ZnSO4 solution, and 0.1 M ZnSO4 solution with 0.001 wt% PEO (Fig. 2g).

When the PEO concentration was increased to 0.1 wt% in the solution, which is equal to the concentration used in the Zn electrodeposition experiments, the proportion of adhesion forces exceeding 1 nN reached 80% (Fig. 2d inserted and Fig. S3). Both height and phase images of Cu substrates soaked in PEO solution were collected to visualize the process of PEO adsorption on Cu substrates, which further supported the conclusion that PEO adsorbs on Cu (Fig. S4, 5, and SI text). Chemical mapping and surface properties of Cu substrates after treatment with PEO solutions provide further evidence that PEO adsorbs to the Cu. Using dried Cu-PEO samples (see methods in the SI text for details on sample preparation), we performed PiFM, which is a technique that combines AFM and infrared spectroscopy, to obtain nanoscale chemical maps of PEO on Cu substrates.[35,36] The PiFM and phase images of Cu-PEO samples were collected simultaneously at an excitation wavelength 1462 cm-1, which is the specific excitation wavelength of PEO.[38,39] The bright regions in the PiFM image indicate the chemical signal of PEO (Fig. 2h).

Because the pattern of bright regions in the PiFM and phase images are similar, we can conclude that soft, sticky regions seen in phase or CFFM measurements consist of PEO on Cu. To evaluate the extent to which the interfacial energy of the Cu surface is affected by PEO adsorption, contact angles of water droplets were measured on bare Cu and Cu subject to treatment with different concentrations (0.001wt%, 0.1wt%) of PEO solution. The results show that the wettability of Cu substrates can be greatly improved after soaking in PEO solution. The contact angle for bare Cu after three minutes of plasma treatment was 71° (Fig. 2j). On plasma-treated Cu substrates soaked in PEO solution for 2 hours and then dried (for the sample preparation protocol, see the SI Methods), the water contact angle was 51° and 21° for 0.001 wt% and 0.1 wt% PEO solutions, respectively (Fig. 2k, l). Zn oxidation and PEO adsorption on Zn Next, we show that the interaction between PEO and the surface of Zn is too weak to control the overall morphology of the Zn films. To investigate the adsorption behavior of PEO on Zn metal, Zn metal was first electrodeposited on Cu before being subjected to PEO adsorption. However, once the voltage that drives electrodeposition was turned off, this composite substrate became unstable in water as Zn plates exhibited etching and surface reorganization (Fig. S6). This effect is attributed to Zn oxidation.[40–42] Both Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) and Grazing Incidence X-ray Diffraction (GIXRD) results showed that the resulting layered hexagonal structures on Cu were oxidation products of Zn metal (Fig. S7 and S8).", "page": 6, "position": 0}

However, after 33 minutes, the grains grow larger until they finally form bundles of platelets (Fig. 3a, Fig. S9b, Figure S10, Video S1). After two hours of immersion in water, Zn foils show visible pitting and a greyish film (Fig. S11). Higher resolution images of the newly formed structure in Fig. 3a captured in situ exhibit a lattice spacing expected for Zn(OH)2 (Fig. 3b and Fig. S12).[43] The in-situ ATR-FTIR measurements were conducted to test Zn chemical transformation in water (Fig. 3c). Upon introduction of water on the zinc foil surface, the ATR-FTIR spectra showed a prominent OH stretch vibration at 3410 cm-1 with a shoulder band at ca. 3220 cm-1, along with the water bending vibration at 1658 cm-1 and a strong peak at 834 cm-1. The latter has been previously reported by Srivastava and Secco[44], Geetha and Sakthi[45] and Wang and Andrews[46] and attributed to a ZnOH bending and OH twisting vibration. These results clearly point to the formation of a hydrated Zn(OH)2 surface. As the hydrolysis reaction progressed, both the stretch and bending vibration peaks dropped in intensities while that of the 834 cm-1 remained constant, suggesting the growth of the Zn(OH)2 layer and the decrease of the amount of hydration water within the detection depth. The much more pronounced reduction of the water bending vibration peak further confirmed the contribution of the hydroxyl groups in the Zn(OH)2 phase. When Zn foil was immersed in 0.1 M ZnSO4 solution, the in-situ AFM results show that the Zn reorganized rapidly into a layered hexagonal structure, which replaced the initial granular structures until they fully occupied the surface (Fig. 3d and Fig. S13, Fig. S14, Video S2).

PEO adsorption on the Zn surface cannot outcompete the natural and spontaneous oxidation of the Zn surface, indicating a weak interaction between Zn and PEO. However, the Zn electrodeposition process is driven by a significant external electrochemical driving force, enabling this reduction reaction to effectively overcome the naturally occurring oxidation of Zn. Consequently, PEO adsorption does not influence Zn electrodeposition, which constitutes the growth process in our system. To summarize, the above results show that PEO smooths the electrodeposited Zn on Cu electrodes because PEO adsorbs on the Cu electrodes and strongly biases the orientation of the Zn nuclei electrodeposited on the Cu surface. In contrast, PEO weakly interacts with the Zn surface and does not influence the Zn growth process. Once Zn is electrodeposited on the Cu surface, the weak Zn- PEO binding does not prevent Zn from oxidizing in the absence of a reducing electric field (E- field), causing any adsorbed PEO to detach from the oxidized Zn. Mechanism by which PEO biases the nucleation orientations The above experimental findings lead us to hypothesize that the adsorption of PEO on the Cu surface influences the local interfacial structure and energy around regions of PEO adsorption, thus biasing the orientation of Zn nuclei. To test this hypothesis, we used simulations to quantify the effect of PEO on three aspects of Zn nucleation on the Cu: 1) biasing the facet specificity of the interfacial energy for Zn nucleation on Cu, 2) altering the structure of the interfacial electrolyte layer, and 3) the dynamics of Zn2+ ions at the interface. Density functional theory (DFT) was employed to compare the role of PEO in biasing the thermodynamics of orientational specificity of Zn nucleation.[53–55] Vacuum calculations revealed the energetic differences for the nucleation of Zn (100) and Zn (002) faces on the Cu (111) surface. The Zn nanoparticle bound with two (100) and six (002) faces was brought into contact with the Cu surface, forming either direct Cu (111) / Zn (100) or Cu (111) / Zn (002) contact. It was found that the interfacial energy of Cu / Zn (100)", "page": 10, "position": 0}

Solvent ∆𝐸 (kJ/mol) PEO (DEG) 294.2 H2O -369.9 The effect of solvent and PEO on interfacial energy was calculated using the comparison of total energies of solvated interfaces. The DFT simulations of Cu (111) / Zn (100) and Cu (111) / Zn (002) were repeated in water- and PEO- environments (Fig. 4a). To keep the same number of each species constant, simulations were performed with 74 water molecules and 14 Diethylene glycol (DEG) molecules representing PEO monomers. Following the vacuum simulations, we considered two orientations of Zn nanoparticles on Cu surfaces and two solvation modes, i.e., water molecules or DEG molecules in direct contact with Zn and Cu surfaces. The packing arrangements of Zn (100) and Zn (002) on Cu (111) remained similar after relaxation in the two modes of solvation (Fig. S21 and Table S1). Our DFT results demonstrate that PEO (DEG) adsorption on Cu modifies the interfacial energy of Zn/Cu/electrolyte interfaces, favoring the stabilization of Zn (002) on the Cu substrate. Specifically, while Zn (100) on Cu is thermodynamically favored in water-saturated conditions, the presence of PEO stabilizes Zn (002) on Cu as the energetically preferred orientation (Table 1). Consequently, PEO-saturated regions promote the formation of flat-lying Zn (002) plates parallel to the Cu substrate, while water-saturated regions result in vertical Zn (100) plates oriented perpendicularly. These results align well with our experimental observations, which show a mixture of plates in various orientations but with a clear bias in orientation distribution after the addition of PEO. Thermodynamic preference of certain orientations of the growing particles is not necessarily insufficient to understand the interfacial processes occurring during electrodeposition, in which kinetics often drives the formation of high-energy morphologies.[56] Coupled kinetic Poisson- Nernst-Plank (PNP) and classical DFT (cDFT) simulations were conducted to elucidate", "page": 12, "position": 0}

There is a weak repulsion between Zn2+ ions and the electrode surface at the distances of 0.75 – 1.75 nm from the electrode surface. However, the repulsive PMF is smaller than 0.0025 eV or about ten times smaller than the thermal energy at room temperature and, thereby, does not affect the electric-potential-driven deposition. Under these conditions, the Zn2+ supply to the surface is unimpeded, and electrodeposition is a reaction-limited process. The reaction-limited electrodeposition drives the formation of thermodynamically stable morphologies,[56] and the formation of plates in (002) orientation to the surface is predicted. In contrast, in the presence of PEO, which creates a low dielectric layer at the interfaces, the PMF of Zn2+ ions has a barrier of 0.8 eV (Fig. 4c). In these simulations, the polymer layer was modeled as a uniform film with a dielectric constant of 2. It was permeable for the ions but created a distinct dielectric environment at the boundary between the metal electrode and aqueous solution with the dielectric constant of 78.5 to simulate PEO adsorption at the interface (Fig. 4c). The corresponding steady-state distribution of Zn2+ ions has a depletion zone 0.7 -1 nm from the surface due to counter ions accumulation about 0.75 nm from the interface (Fig. 4c). The significant barrier in the PMF and partial depletion of Zn2+ ions close to the interface suggest that PEO shifts the mechanism of electrodeposition toward diffusion-limited process. Under these conditions, either higher energy morphologies develop when reaction- and diffusion-driven mechanisms compete, or dendrites are formed in a purely diffusion-limited process. Specifically, if at the pure electrode/aqueous electrolyte interface, the reaction kinetics is controlled by the reaction rate, in the presence of PEO electron transfer rate and diffusion rate of Zn2+ ions both define the growth rate and morphology of the electrodeposited Zn.[57,58] When the reaction rate of Zn2+ ions reducing to Zn is relatively larger than the Zn2+ diffusion rate, the whole process will be diffusion-limited due to a slow diffusion rate, and only Zn2+ in near-surface regions can be reduced to Zn due to a lack", "page": 13, "position": 0}

In this way, PEO adsorption confines electrodeposition to a narrower interfacial region, reduces the probability of vertical and inclined growth, and promotes parallel orientation of Zn plates. The parallel orientation is also thermodynamically more favorable in the presence of PEO, as the energy simulations predicted (Table 1). Thereby, a higher fraction of parallel-orientated Zn plates is expected under mixed reaction-diffusion conditions. Reducing the diffusion rate by lowering ZnSO4 concentration shifts electrodeposition toward a diffusion-limited process, leading to Zn plates with a bigger parallel-to-inclined ratio (Fig. S22). Similarly, modulating the relative rate of reaction and diffusion processes and increasing the reaction rate by increasing the current density can also explain the results of other electrodeposition studies.

Subsequently, the Zn platelets grow layer-by- layer using the first layer of Zn (002) as a template (Fig. 4d) Discussion Multiple side reactions accompany Zn electrodeposition, including hydrogen evolution and oxygen reduction, which increase the pH. This pH shift leads to the precipitation of Zn(OH)2, ZHS, and ZnO from the supersaturation solution, both of which also present plate-like morphologies.[11] Thus, the plates observed in EC-AFM might be Zn reduced from Zn2+ under a reducing E-field, or Zn(OH)2, ZHS and ZnO precipitated due to the pH increase. To test for this phenomenon, we hindered the oxygen reduction reactions by removing dissolved oxygen from the solution. However, a similar evolution in morphology was observed with and without dissolved oxygen, indicating that the platelet formation is not attributable to side reactions related to oxygen reduction (Fig.1 and Fig S23). To investigate whether the increase in pH can generate the observed platelets, liquid AFM under flowing conditions and increasing pH was conducted. When the pH exceeds 6.3, 6.6 and 6.8, 0.1 M ZnSO4 solutions become supersaturated with respect to ZHS, ZnO (Zincite), and Zn(OH)2, respectively. However, we do not observe any morphological changes or formation of platelets on the Cu surface in conditions of pH 6.6, 7.2, or 8 (Fig. S24), demonstrating that the expected pH increase is not sufficient to drive the formation of Zn(OH)2, ZnO or ZHS on Cu. Thus, the hexagonal platelets we observe in in-situ EC-AFM must be Zn reduced from Zn2+. The Zn(OH)2 and ZHS observed in ex-situ experiments (Fig. S7, S8, and Fig. S25) both in this study and others likely comes from the oxidation of Zn into Zn(OH)2 and ZHS after the reducing E-field is turned", "page": 14, "position": 0}

In addition to side reactions, the influence of potential alloying of Zn into Cu was considered but was excluded, as no difference was observed for the electrodeposition of Zn on fresh Cu or on Cu that was cycled until reaching the steady state under the same experimental conditions. Furthermore, the influence of Cl- impurities in ZnSO4 salts was considered but excluded due to the trace amounts at which they were present (1-2 µM in 0.1 M ZnSO4 solution).

Thus grains of the substrates that present specific crystallographic orientations might facilitate the nucleation of Zn (002) plane.[15] Electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) measurements were conducted to test this hypothesis.[63] The orientation map of the Cu substrate before Zn electrodeposition combined with SEM images of the Zn morphology deposited on the same Cu spot after 30 seconds, shows no clear correlation between the crystallographic orientations of Zn plates and the grains of the underlying Cu substrate (Fig. S26). These data show face-selectivity of PEO adsorption to Cu substrates is not responsible for controlling the orientation of Zn plates during nucleation. Conclusions This study demonstrates a distinct mechanism for using polymers to smooth electrodes in Zn aqueous battery systems and answers the long-lasting question of why a widely used polymer, PEO, smooths electrodes, introducing a novel design principle for interface smoothing in solution- based electrochemical systems. This approach leverages polymer additives with appropriately strong binding to the substrate and weaker binding to the deposited metal to precisely tune interfacial energy and structure, enabling control over the orientations of nuclei in the initial thin layer of Zn and promoting continued layer-by-layer growth. Moreover, by using such developed platforms and standardized protocols, extending the testing timeframe beyond initial electrodeposition to multiple cycles will deepen our understanding of how polymer additives affect long-term battery cycling performance. This principle can be further refined by exploring how electrolyte composition and polymer chemical structure impact polymer- induced electrode smoothing in electrochemical systems. Rational design of the electrode surface can be accomplished by grafting single polymer layers on the electrode surfaces, which is an efficient alternative for conventional surface modification, such as surface coating. This approach achieves interface smoothing by forming polymer-saturated regions in solution environments, all while maintaining electron conductivity and reducing the high costs typically associated with conventional surface modification. It offers an efficient and cost-effective strategy to enhance device stability, performance, and longevity across a wide range of applications where precise control of the", "page": 15, "position": 0}

Materials and Experimental Methods Electrolytes Preparation All cell components and the electrolyte reservoir were sonicated in ultrapure water (Milli-Q, 18.2 ΜΩ·cm) for 10 minutes and dried using an N₂ gun. Electrolytes were prepared using ultrapure water (Water OmniTrace Ultra, Sigma Aldrich), zinc sulfate heptahydrate (99.5%, for analysis, Thermo Scientific Chemicals), and polyethylene oxide (PEO, M.W. 100,000, Thermo Scientific Chemicals). Solutions with varying PEO concentrations were obtained by diluting stock PEO solutions. The 5 wt% PEO stock solution was prepared by dissolving PEO in water through repeated cycles of sonication and vortexing until fully dissolved. The solution was then centrifuged at 13,400 rpm for 2 minutes to separate any insoluble components. The clear supernatant was collected and used as the stock solution. For experiments requiring deoxygenation, the electrolytes were purged with N₂ gas for at least 10 minutes to remove dissolved oxygen. Cu and Zn Substrates Preparation Polycrystalline Copper foil (9 µm thick, Purity≥ 99.8%, MTI Corporation), punched into 12.7 mm- diameter round plates, was used as the working electrode. Polycrystalline Zinc foil (0.25 mm thick, 99.98% metals basis, Thermo Scientific Chemicals), cut into 10 mm × 10 mm pieces, served as AFM substrates for studying zinc oxidation reactions and PEO adsorption behaviors. To remove carbon contamination and surface oxides, Zn foils were first rinsed multiple times with acetone and Milli-Q water, followed by a 90-second treatment in 0.1 M H₂SO₄. Cu foils underwent a similar cleaning protocol but without the initial acetone rinse. Ethanol was then used to remove residual acid, and the foils were dried with an N₂ gun. Before assembly into the AFM cell, the treated Cu and Zn foils underwent a 3-minute plasma treatment using an N₂ source. Cu was cycled until reaching the steady state to produce the electrode surface, which forms the Cu-Zn interfacial alloy based on the need.[1] In-situ Electrochemical Atomic Force Microscopy (EC-AFM) Measurements EC-AFM experiments were performed using the Multimode Nanoscope 8 AFM (Bruker) equipped with a standard liquid AFM cell (Bruker).

During electrodeposition, either a constant voltage of -0.015 V was applied, or the voltage was gradually decreased from 0 V to -0.015 V at a uniform scan rate of 0.01 mV/s over 25 minutes. All in-situ EC-AFM imaging was performed in liquid using either PeakForce Tapping™ mode or amplitude modulation mode at room temperature (23 °C) on the Nanoscope 8 AFM (J scanner, Bruker). An FM-20 AFM probe from Nanoworld, with a spring constant k = 2.8 N/m, and a resonance frequency f=75 kHz, was used for imaging. The probe was plasma-cleaned for 3 minutes before imaging. The typical scanning rate is 1 Hz, and the drive frequency was set to approximately 75 kHz. The amplitude setpoint was controlled to maintain image quality without changing the surface topography. Offline data processing and analysis were performed using the Nanoscope Analysis 2.0 software package (Bruker). The slope distribution of the AFM images was analyzed using Gwyddion's Slope Distribution function.

Thus, the lighter part in the phase image represents a softer region attracting probes, and the harder sample will show a darker color. The newly formed lighter phase is softer than the surrounding regions, which might be adsorbed soft PEO polymer on hard Cu metal substrates. We then zoomed in to obtain the high-resolution images of Cu after soaking in the PEO solution (Fig. S4e, S4f). The lighter region in the phase image shows an amorphous polymer aggregation morphology, as highlighted in the white and green circles in Fig. S4e, S4f. By correlating height and phase images, it is proved that PEO adsorbed on the Cu surface with amorphous structures.", "page": 31, "position": 0}

The selected in-situ AFM images of PEO adsorption on Cu with time are shown in Fig. S5. The amorphous structures of PEO include the aggregation (highlighted in the green circle in Fig. S5a, S5b), the ring-shaped structure (highlighted in the blue circle in Fig. S5a, S5b), and the porous film structure (highlighted by the white arrow in Fig. S5f). The adsorbed PEO seems to cover larger and larger areas of Cu substrates in the early soaking stage with time going by, as highlighted in the white circles in Fig. S5b, S5d. After soaking in PEO solution for 2 hours, the aggregation and the ring-shaped structure tend to relax into porous film structures with time (Fig. S5f). The aggregation of PEO on the Cu substrate might lead to the lower nucleation density of Zn ECD, which was observed in Fig. 1b compared to Fig. 1a. Those thick aggregations might block partial conductive Cu surfaces and hinder the Zn ECD process from happening. The adsorbed PEO with ring-shaped or porous film structures might tune the interfacial energy of Cu-electrolyte interfaces without blocking the active Cu surfaces for electron and charge transfer.[27] Figure S6.

We adopted the protocol to correlate phase and height images to visualize the PEO polymer adsorption and distribution on Zn surfaces. Our results show that PEO will detach from the Zn surface due to surface reorganization of Zn. In the initial stage of Zn foil soaking in 0.1 wt% PEO solution, two phases coexist on the rough Zn foil surface (Fig. S19a, S19b). Four hours later, the morphology evolved to bundles of platelet structure with a bigger grain size. The phase changed from two phases coexisting to only one phase (Fig. S19c, S19d). The phase images with higher resolution were conducted to understand the underlying mechanisms. From the region highlighted by white circles, we can see the lighter region diminished when the surface was reorganized, which means PEO detaching from the Zn surface due to Zn surface reorganization (Fig. S19e, S19f). Figure S20. The DFT results show that the nucleation of the Zn (002) plane is less preferable than the nucleation of the Zn (100) on Cu in vacuum. The energy per surface atom is 1.2 times lower for (100) orientation than that for (002) plate.
