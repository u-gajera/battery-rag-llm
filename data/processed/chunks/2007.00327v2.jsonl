(Dated: October 5, 2020) Many positive electrode materials in lithium ion batteries include transition metals which are diﬃcult to describe by electronic structure methods like density functional theory (DFT) due to the presence of multiple oxidation states. A prominent example is the lithium manganese oxide spinel LixMn2O4 with 0 ≤x ≤2. While DFT, employing the local hybrid functional PBE0r, provides a reliable description, the need for extended computer simulations of large structural models remains a signiﬁcant challenge. Here, we close this gap by constructing a DFT-based high-dimensional neural network potential (HDNNP) providing accurate energies and forces at a fraction of the computational costs. As diﬀerent oxidation states and the resulting Jahn-Teller distortions represent a new level of complexity for HDNNPs, the potential is carefully validated by performing X-ray diﬀraction experiments. We demonstrate that the HDNNP provides atomic level details and is able to predict a series of properties like the lattice parameters and expansion with increasing Li content or temperature, the orthorhombic to cubic transition, the lithium diﬀusion barrier, and the phonon frequencies. We show that for understanding these properties access to large time and length scales as enabled by the HDNNP is essential to close the gap between theory and experiment. I.

INTRODUCTION Advances in battery technology are more important than ever to provide a reliable energy supply for count- less applications, from portable electronic devices to elec- tric vehicles, and in particular lithium ion batteries have gained a central role [1, 2]. One important example for positive electrode materials in lithium ion batteries is the lithium manganese oxide spinel LixMn2O4 with 0 ≤x ≤2 [3–5], which is the subject of this study. Due to its abundance and non-toxicity LixMn2O4 is more environmentally friendly than other lithium ion positive electrode materials [1]. Furthermore, it has also recently been used as an electrocatalyst [6–8]. The crystal structure of LixMn2O4 is a cubic spinel with space group Fd3m in the range from 0 ≤x ≤1 and above ∼290 K (Figures 1 (a) and (b)) [9, 10]. The λ-Mn2O4 (x = 0) structure is based on MnO6 octahe- dra. These share half of their edges and form a super- structure of (MnO6)4 tetrahedra, which themselves are corner-sharing. Using electrochemical intercalation, for ∗marco.eckhoﬀ@chemie.uni-goettingen.de † joerg.behler@uni-goettingen.de FIG. 1.

The ﬁgure was created with VESTA version 3.4.4 [12]. example, Li can be inserted in tetrahedral sites [13]. In LiMn2O4 every corner of a MnO6 octahedron is shared with one LiO4 tetrahedron. The Li positions build two individual fcc sublattices, i.e., a diamond structure. In the range from x = 0 to 1 the Li intercalation leads to an almost linearly increasing lattice constant without major changes of the manganese oxide host lattice [14, 15].

In Li2Mn2O4, the Li ions occupy octahedral sites. Variations in the Li content change the oxidation states of the Mn ions [17]. While in λ-Mn2O4 all Mn ions are in the MnIV state, Li2Mn2O4 exclusively contains MnIII ions. In stoichiometric LiMn2O4 the numbers of MnIII and MnIV ions are equal. The MnIII ions are in the high-spin (hs) conﬁguration with the d orbital occupa- tion t3 2ge1 g leading to Jahn-Teller distorted MnIIIO6 oc- tahedra [18]. This is the reason for the formation of the tetragonal spinel structure for x = 2. The cubic spinel structure present for 0 < x ≤1 is a result of the disordered MnIII/MnIV arrangement [19] in combination with the thermal averaging of the spatial orientations of the Jahn-Teller distorted octahedra [20]. Below ∼290 K the order increases yielding an orthorhombic spinel with space group Fddd for LiMn2O4 [10]. An accurate description of the narrow, partially ﬁlled Mn d bands in LixMn2O4 is challenging for electronic structure methods like density functional theory (DFT), and both the local density approximation as well as the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) are not able to provide the correct electronic structure of LixMn2O4 [19, 21–23]. Therefore, at least the level of GGA+U or hybrid functionals is required to obtain separate MnIV (t3 2ge0 g) and Jahn-Teller distorted hs-MnIII (t3 2ge1 g) ions as well as a ﬁnite band gap [19, 24]. In a previous study [25] we investigated in detail which Hartree-Fock exchange terms have to be added to GGA functionals in order to obtain the correct electronic structure with minimal computational eﬀort. Our extensive benchmark of various exchange-correlation functionals for LixMn2O4 and numerous related materials [25] showed that the lo- cal hybrid functional PBE0r [26], which relies on on-site Hartree-Fock exchange only, enables to combine the ac- curacy of conventional hybrid functionals with the eﬃ- ciency of GGA calculations.

Speciﬁcally, our previous work [25] focused on the elec- tronic structure of bulk LixMn2O4 unit cells at 0 K. De- spite the good agreement with experimental data, DFT does not enable studies of substantially larger, more re- alistic model systems at ﬁnite temperatures due to its high computational eﬀort. However, dynamic studies on nanosecond timescales are required, for example, to in- vestigate the transition from the orthorhombic to the cu- bic crystal structure at about 290 K [10] or to examine the (de)lithiation process with associated long-distance dif- fusion, structural changes, and a very inhomogeneous Li distribution. A more eﬃcient atomistic potential, which allows to avoid the demanding electronic structure cal- culations and provides the energies and forces directly as a function of the atomic positions, is required for this purpose. Machine learning has been demonstrated to be a promising tool to develop highly accurate and eﬃcient atomistic potentials [27–30]. Machine learning potentials are constructed using a large number of ﬂexible functions, which are adapted to reference data from electronic struc- ture calculations to represent the potential energy sur- face. Potentials based on neural networks [31–36], Gaus- sian approximation potentials [37, 38], and many others [39, 40] have been applied very successfully to describe various types of systems like molecules in the gas phase [41–44], liquids and solutions [45–47], solid/liquid inter- faces [48, 49], and solid bulk materials [50, 51] as well as surface supported clusters [52].

In this work we develop and validate a high- dimensional neural network potential (HDNNP), a type of machine learning potential suitable for very large sys- tems that has been suggested by Behler and Parrinello [33, 53, 54], to represent the potential energy surface of bulk LixMn2O4. HDNNPs can autonomously identify, for example in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, if a prediction is reliable or if a newly visited conﬁguration has to be added to the training data set [55, 56]. The ref- erence data set consists of potential energies and atomic forces of small periodic LixMn2O4 cells obtained from the PBE0r functional [25, 26] including D3 dispersion correc- tions [57, 58]. We performed DFT calculations for a wide range of structural motifs including thermally distorted conﬁgurations. Since LixMn2O4 is used as positive electrode material, Li diﬀusion barriers as well as structural deformations during charging and discharging are important physi- cal properties. These are studied as well as structural changes depending on composition and temperature, most prominently the transition from the orthorhombic to the cubic structure occurring near room temperature. In order to validate the HDNNP, we compare to DFT data as well as to in situ X-ray diﬀraction (XRD) exper- iments where we investigate the evolution of the crystal structure of LixMn2O4 nanoparticles while varying the Li content and the temperature. This paper is organized as follows: Firstly, we out- line the key concepts of the PBE0r functional and the HDNNP method and present a modiﬁed initialization al- gorithm for the weights in the atomic neural networks of the HDNNP.

PBE0r local hybrid density functional DFT is in principle exact for the energetics of the elec- tronic ground state [59, 60]. However, since the explicit form of the exchange-correlation functional is unknown, numerous functionals have been proposed providing dif- ferent levels of accuracy [61–63]. Hybrid functionals, which are based on GGA functionals mixed with some amount of exact Hartree-Fock exchange, are currently considered as the state-of-the-art. The PBE0r exchange-correlation functional EPBE0r xc [25, 26] is a local hybrid functional derived from the fre- quently used PBE0 functional [64, 65]. In contrast to PBE0, in which 1 4 of the PBE [66] GGA exchange is replaced by Hartree-Fock exchange, PBE0r relies on on- site Hartree-Fock exchange terms EHF, r x only, such that its form is given by EPBE0r xc = EPBE xc + N X n=1 an \u0000EHF, r x, n −EPBE, r x, n \u0001 . (1) Here, on-site exchange refers to those contributions, which describe the interaction between orbitals centered on the same atom. Moreover, the Hartree-Fock mixing factors an of the N atoms can be element-speciﬁc. We employ 0.07 for Li, 0.05 for O, and 0.09 for Mn [25]. While the calculation of the Hartree-Fock exchange terms dominates the computational costs of hybrid func- tionals, in the PBE0r approach the eﬀort is drastically reduced to a level comparable to conventional GGA func- tionals. However, in contrast to GGA functionals, which yield a poor description of transition metal oxides with narrow, partially ﬁlled d bands, the exact on-site ex- change of PBE0r correctly splits the otherwise degen- erate d band into multiplets of ﬁlled and empty orbitals leading to a more accurate description, which is also the case for LixMn2O4 studied in this work.

B. High-dimensional neural network potentials Like all machine learning potentials, HDNNPs [33] provide a functional relation between the structure of the system and its potential energy. This relation cru- cially depends on descriptors, which fulﬁll the manda- tory conditions of translational, rotational and permu- tational invariance of the potential energy surface, i.e., all equivalent representations of a system must yield the same potential energy. In HDNNPs many-body atom- centered symmetry functions [53] are employed as de- scriptors, which ensure that these requirements are met exactly. The local chemical environment of each atom includ- ing all neighboring atoms inside a cutoﬀsphere of radius Rc is described by a vector of atom-centered symmetry function values G. The cutoﬀradius has to be suﬃ- ciently large to include all energetically relevant interac- tions, and typically 6 to 10 ˚A are used. This study em- ploys two diﬀerent types of symmetry functions, namely radial symmetry functions and angular symmetry func- tions, whose functional forms are given in the Supple- mental Material [67]. Typically, between 20 to 200 sym- metry functions are used for each atom depending on the complexity of the system. Except for the speciﬁcation of the chemical elements of the atoms no further information such as atom types, oxidation states, or predeﬁned bonds are required mak- ing HDNNPs reactive, i.e., they are able to describe the making and breaking of bonds with the accuracy of the underlying electronic structure method. Because the di- mension of the symmetry function vectors is given by the selected symmetry functions and does not dependent on the chemical environments, the symmetry function vec- tors are suitable as input for neural networks with ﬁxed architecture. Individual atomic neural networks are then con- structed", "page": 2, "position": 1}

Individual atomic neural networks are then con- structed for each chemical element α, which process the structural information of the geometric environment of each atom n yielding its atomic energy contribution Eα n. The sum of all atomic energy contributions is the po- tential energy E of the many-atom system containing Nelements elements and N α atoms atoms of element α, E = Nelements X α=1 Nα atoms X n=1 Eα n . (2) The atomic energy contributions are calculated using atomic neural networks which are standard feed-forward neural networks [68]. In the output layer a linear acti- vation function is employed, in the neurons of the hid- den layers we use the hyperbolic tangent. The functional form for the atomic energy contributions employed in our study using three hidden layers is thus given by Eα n =b4 1 + n3 X l=1 a34 l1 · tanh ( b3 l + n2 X k=1 a23 kl · tanh \" b2 k + n1 X j=1 a12 jk · tanh b1 j + nG X i=1 a01 ij · Gα n,i !#) .

The weight parameters aρσ µν, which connect neu- ron µ in layer ρ to neuron ν in layer σ, and bias weights bσ ν, which are added to the input values of neuron ν in layer σ, are identical for all atoms of the same element. For clarity, the superscript α is not shown for the num- ber of neurons per layer and for the weights in Equation 3 although these quantities can be diﬀerent for each el- ement. In conclusion, for each atom in the system the individual values of the symmetry function vectors are calculated and processed in the atomic neural network of the respective element. The resulting atomic energy con- tributions are then added yielding the potential energy of the system. The weight parameters of all atomic neural networks are obtained simultaneously in an iterative gradient- based optimization process, in which the errors of known potential energies and atomic force components for a set of training structures are minimized applying an adap- tive, global, extended Kalman ﬁlter [69, 70]. More de- tailed information about the HDNNP method can be found in several reviews on this topic [54, 56, 71]. C. Initialization of the weight parameters The construction of the HDNNP requires a random ini- tialization of the weights in the atomic neural networks as starting point for the iterative optimization. Here, we develop and implement a modiﬁcation of the method proposed by Xavier [72]. Speciﬁcally, we initialize all weight parameters a except for the ones connecting the last hidden layer and the output layer, a34 µ1 in Equation 3, as uniformly distributed random numbers in the range from −1 to 1 divided by the square root of the num- ber of neurons in the ﬁrst of the two connected layers. The bias weights b, except for the bias weight of the out- put neuron, b4 1 in Equation 3, are set to 0.

With this procedure proposed by Xavier [72] the input values of the hyperbolic tangent activation functions of the neu- rons should not be in the saturation region, which could hamper a good convergence of the ﬁtting process. In the input layer, each symmetry function G is shifted by −Gtraining set mean and divided by Gtraining set max −Gtraining set min of the respective function. For the remaining parameters, i.e., the weight parame- ters connecting the last hidden layer and the output layer, we developed an initialization method based on informa- tion from the reference data set. First, the range of ener- gies Erange in the reference structures is calculated. Sec- ond, the mean atomic contribution to the energy Emean is determined for each element by a least-squares ﬁt. If the stoichiometry in the reference data is the same for all structures, also the mean atomic contribution averaged over all elements can be used. The weights parameters a connecting the last hidden layer and the output neuron are then set to uniformly distributed random numbers in the range from −Erange 2 to Erange 2 divided by the square root of the number of neurons in the last hidden layer. The bias weight b of the output neuron is set to Emean. This enables an eﬃcient training of the HDNNP, espe- cially for atomic neural networks with more than two hidden layers making use of a funnel-like architecture. III. COMPUTATIONAL DETAILS A. Density functional theory calculations The DFT reference calculations were performed us- ing the Car-Parrinello Projector Augmented-Wave (CP- PAW) code (version from September 28, 2016) [73, 74]. The settings of the PBE0r calculations were taken from our previous study [25].

This yields an accuracy of 1 meV", "page": 3, "position": 1}

Only the plane wave cutoﬀs for the auxiliary wave functions and for the auxiliary densi- ties were increased to 35 Eh and to 140 Eh, respectively. This yields an accuracy of 1 meV per atom for the for- mation energies of LixMn2O4, with x = 0, 0.5, 1, 2, com- pared to the complete basis set limit. The initial spin di- rections of the Mn atoms in LixMn2O4 were taken from our previous study [25], whereby the λ-Mn2O4 spin con- ﬁguration was used for 0 ≤x ≤ 1 8 and the LiMn2O4 spin conﬁguration for 1 4 ≤x ≤1 corresponding to the energetic preference. The atomic spins were calculated by a mapping the spin density onto the one-center expansions of the partial waves. For each atom the contributions inside a cutoﬀ sphere were added. The cutoﬀradii were set to 1.2 times the covalent radii of the corresponding atoms which are given in our previous study [25]. The D3 dispersion corrections using Becke-Johnson damping were calculated by the DFT-D3 software (ver- sion from June 14, 2016) [57, 58]. The settings given for the HSE06 functional were applied as described in our previous benchmark [25]. The nudged elastic band calculations [75, 76] were per- formed using CP-PAW and the Python module of the Atomic Simulation Environment (ASE) [77] employing a self-written interface. B. Construction of the reference data set While the functional form of the HDNNP is very ﬂex- ible, which allows to represent the reference DFT data very accurately, it does not have a physical foundation. Thus, the correct topology of the potential energy sur- face has to be “learned” exclusively from the information provided in the reference data set. Therefore, the quality of the reference data set, which has to cover the con- ﬁguration space relevant for the intended simulations, is essential for the reliability of the HDNNP. Three important points have to", "page": 3, "position": 2}

Second, the amount and diversity of information in the reference data set has to be suﬃcient to represent the relevant part of the conﬁguration space reliably. In the past, we have developed a detailed protocol based on active learning to systematically identify and add important conﬁgurations to the reference data set in a self-consistent process [55]. This process is accompa- nied by a careful multi-step validation process to ensure that all conﬁgurations visited in our simulations are well- represented in the database and thus correctly described by the HDNNP. The iterative learning process is sum- marized below as starting point in the discussion of spe- ciﬁc challenges in the construction of the reference data set for a system with a complex electronic structure as LixMn2O4. Third, the reference data set has to consistently repre- sent one potential energy surface determined employing one reference method. One electronic state – typically the ground state – of the system can be considered as oth- erwise the potential energy would not be a well-deﬁned function of the atomic structure. Therefore, we only con- sider ground state spin conﬁgurations and one consistent arrangement of spin directions. As many arrangements in LixMn2O4 are almost degenerate within the accuracy of the DFT reference calculations [25], the arrangement of spin directions has only a marginally small inﬂuence on the energy. For an initial set of conﬁgurations, experimentally de- termined structures can be used. In order to include information about thermal distortions, the atomic posi- tions and lattice vectors can be modiﬁed randomly within a reasonable range. In this study we displaced the atomic positions inside spheres with radii of up to 0.2 ˚A and changed the lattice vectors within a range of at most ±3%. The energy and force components of each system have then been determined in electronic structure calcu- lations. With this initial data, a preliminary HDNNP can be constructed that allows to perform MD simula- tions to further explore the conﬁguration space guided by the atomic forces.

With this initial data, a preliminary HDNNP can be constructed that allows to perform MD simula- tions to further explore the conﬁguration space guided by the atomic forces. By using two diﬀerent HDNNPs or even a larger ensemble, obtained for example using diﬀer- ent initial weights and neural network architectures but trained on the same reference data set, missing conﬁgu- rations can be identiﬁed based on the deviations in their predicted energies and forces. Deviations above a prede- ﬁned threshold indicate structures being too distant from the available training data, which should then be recom- puted by DFT and added to the reference set to improve the HDNNP. The HDNNP autonomously explores and learns the conﬁguration space of the investigated system by iteratively repeating this process. However, in particular in the early stages of this pro- cess, unphysical trajectories can emerge if conﬁgurations are visited in the simulations, which are too diﬀerent from the training set of the HDNNP. Removing structures with unphysically short nearest-neighbour distances or too high energies and forces, which do not occur at the temperatures and pressures of interest, is advisable to restrict the reference data set to include only reason- able structures. Moreover for unphysically close atoms, electronic structure calculations can fail to converge to the correct ground-state energy. Even if electronic struc- ture calculations are carefully checked for a good con- vergence behavior, they still can get stuck in metastable electronic states, which is diﬃcult to detect. In particu- lar for LixMn2O4 we observed this phenomenon due to its complex electronic structure and variety of electronic states that are energetically close to the ground state. Therefore, we followed two strategies to clean the refer- ence data set from incorrect electronic structure data: 1. In LixMn2O4 the number of MnIII ions is equal to the number of Li ions.

Therefore, we followed two strategies to clean the refer- ence data set from incorrect electronic structure data: 1. In LixMn2O4 the number of MnIII ions is equal to the number of Li ions. If the result of an electronic structure calculation diﬀers from this relation, it does not provide the correct electronic ground state. In order to check this relation we calculated the absolute values of the atomic spins using DFT. hs-MnIII ions have an abso- lute atomic spin of 2 ¯h, while the spin of MnIV ions is 3 2 ¯h. This allows us to count the number of MnIII and MnIV ions to identify calculations that did not yield the right electronic ground state. However, due to thermal ﬂuc- tuations, intermediate structures exists where the Jahn- Teller distortion of an octahedron of an initial hs-MnIII ion decreases while that of an adjacent close-to-ideal oc- tahedron increases. As a consequence, a transition exists in which the eg electron of a MnIIIO6 octahedron can hop to an adjacent MnIVO6 octahedron. In the transi- tion state the eg electron is shared between both sites as in Zener polarons. This information is important for the potential energy surface and must not be removed from the reference data set. However, structures including Mn ions with atomic spins outside the interval between 3 2 and 2 ¯h, structures with too few or too many MnIII ions considering the transition states, or structures includ- ing MnIII ions in octahedra corresponding to a MnIVO6 geometry and vice versa, are not suitable for the refer- ence data set because they do not describe the electronic ground state. 2.

Still, the training process of the HDNNP re- veals these suspicious energies because they do not ﬁt to the general trend. The goal of the ﬁtting process of the weight parameters is to minimize the root mean squared error of the energies. Since most of the structures of the training set are correct, these data points dominate the ﬁtting process, and the minority of problematic struc- tures, which has energies and forces being incompatible with the majority of the data, is less well described.

If data points show the same large error, irrespective of the speciﬁc HDNNP, it is very likely that the electronic structure did not converge correctly and the data point should be removed. On the other hand, energies which are not well represented in just one of the two HDNNPs are just poorly ﬁtted. Such deviations reveal that the general quality of the HDNNP has to be improved, but the corresponding data should be kept in the data set. Further details about the construction of the reference data set can be found in various reviews [54, 56, 71]. C. Construction of the high-dimensional neural network potential The construction of the HDNNP was carried out us- ing the RuNNer code (version from August 22, 2019) [54, 56, 78]. The atomic neural networks consist of an input layer with nα G neurons depending on the speciﬁc element, three hidden layers with 20, 15, and 10 neu- rons, respectively, and an output layer with one neuron. The employed symmetry functions with a cutoﬀradius of Rc = 12 a0, with a0 being the Bohr radius, are given in the Supplemental Material [67]. The HDNNP was trained on the formation energies, i.e., on total DFT en- ergies minus the sums of the energies of the atoms in their reference structures, which are body centered cu- bic Li, gaseous O2, and α-Mn. Further, the DFT atomic force components (Fx, Fy, Fz) of the reference structures have been used for training the HDNNP. 90% of the refer- ence data were used to determine the weight parameters. With the remaining 10% the reliability of the HDNNP for unknown structures was tested. The initialization of the weights in the atomic neural networks is discussed in Section II C.

Simulations The MD simulations were performed using the Large- scale Atomic/Molecular Massively Parallel Simulator (LAMMPS) (version from August 7, 2019) [79, 80]. The neural network potential package (n2p2) (version from December 9, 2019) [81] was included in order to use HDNNPs with LAMMPS. The Nos´e-Hoover [82, 83] ther- mostat and barostat were applied to run simulations in the isothermal-isobaric (NpT) ensemble. The coupling constants were set to 0.05 ps and 0.5 ps, respectively. The time step of the MD simulations was 0.5 fs except for the microcanonical (NV E) simulations to calculate the phonon density of states with the aid of the Python package pwtools [84], for which it was reduced to 0.25 fs. All NpT simulations were performed at a pressure of p = 1 bar. The simulation cell vector angles were ﬁxed at 90 ◦. Thermodynamic data were calculated after an initial equilibration period of 1 ns. The basin-hopping Monte Carlo [85] calculations also used LAMMPS and n2p2 for the geometry optimizations employing the conjugate gradient algorithm. Only Monte Carlo steps of the Li ions between the tetrahedral sites occupied in LiMn2O4 were allowed. The positions of all other atoms were only changed during the geometry op- timizations. This grid-based basin-hopping Monte Carlo (GBHMC) approach allows an eﬃcient sampling of dif- ferent Li distributions inside LixMn2O4. IV.

The mean particle diameter was identiﬁed to be (44 ± 14) nm using transmission electron microscopy and scanning electron microscopy [8]. The particles mainly consist of truncated octahedra and some truncated rhombic dodecahedra [8]. An XRD diﬀrac- togram (see Supplemental Material [12, 67, 86]) of the as purchased material ﬁts to the expected cubic spinel structure with a lattice constant of 8.234(2) ˚A. Two ad- ditional cubic phases with a volume share of less than 1% have also been detected. Applying the Scherrer equation to the LiMn2O4 peak widths, a volume averaged crystal- lite size of (61 ± 9) nm has been found, which is larger than the unweighted value obtained from imaging, as ex- pected. In situ XRD diﬀractograms were recorded during (de)lithiation in the range of 0.48 ≤x ≤2 with a speciﬁ- cally designed battery cell at CIC energiGune in Vitoria- Gasteiz, Spain. The cell consists of a Be window, which is coated with a thin Al foil on the inner surface, followed by the positive electrode material consisting of 85 wt% LiMn2O4 and 15 wt% carbon black, and then by a sep- arator and a metallic Li negative electrode. 1 mol l−1 LiPF6 in EC/DMC was used as electrolyte. The cell was assembled in a glove box and then cycled from 3.0 V to 4.5 V and back again before it was held for 20 h at open circuit voltage. This was followed by (de)lithiation of LixMn2O4 from x = 1 to x = 0.48 and back to x = 1 with a set rate of C/30.

Close to the phase tran- sition temperature, from 260 K to 295 K, a step size of ∆T = 5 K was used. The LiMn2O4 powder specimen was compacted into a glass capillary, which was placed in a nitrogen gas ﬂow cryostat with a temperature sen- sor. The specimen was held for 30 min after reaching the initial nitrogen gas setpoint of 100 K to allow for ther- mal equilibration prior to taking the ﬁrst diﬀractogram. Thermal equilibration times of 10 min were allowed for each subsequent temperature step. The recorded poly- crystalline diﬀracted ring pattern was then azimuthally integrated. Although the small peak splitting due to the cubic to orthorhombic transition has been observed us- ing high resolution synchrotron and neutron diﬀraction experiments in powder samples [20, 87, 88] and using sin- gle crystal XRD [10, 89], it could not be resolved in our XRD experiments of polycrystalline powder sample, so that the observed peaks were ﬁt with a cubic structure using the procedure described above.

In total, 682431 atomic environ- ments and 2047293 force components are thus available for training and 77911 atomic environments and 233733 force components for testing. More detailed information about the number of structures for each composition are given in the Supplemental Material [67]. The formation energies cover a range from −2.15 to −1.61 eV atom−1. The root mean squared error (RMSE) of the energies is 1.8 meV atom−1 for the training set and 2.2 meV atom−1 for the test set. The maximal error of the energies is 9.9 meV atom−1 for the training set and 10.9 meV atom−1 for the test set. 98.00% of the struc- tures in the training set and 95.25% of the structures in the test set have an error smaller than 5 meV atom−1. The largest absolute force component in the reference data set is 4.87 eV a−1 0 . The RMSE of the force com- ponents is 0.108 eV a−1 0 for the training set, while it is 0.107 eV a−1 0 for the test set. The maximum errors are 1.50 and 1.05 eV a−1 0 for the training and test set, re- spectively. Only 0.29% of the 2047293 force components in the training set show an absolute error greater than 0.5 eV a−1 0 . The respective fraction for the test set is 0.29% of the 233733 force components.

The reliability of the HDNNP was tested in 10 ns NV E MD simulations starting from LixMn2O4 structures with diﬀerent Li content in the range 0 ≤x ≤2 equilibrated at 500 K in NpT MD simulations. The energy conservation in the NV E simulations is very good. Drifts of the to- tal energy are only in the order of 10−6 eV atom−1 ns−1. The conﬁguration space covered by the training data was not exceeded during any simulation, i.e., no extrapolation was detected. B. Validation on density functional theory and experimental data In order to assess the quality of the HDNNP for LixMn2O4 we will ﬁrst compare several physical proper- ties determined using the HDNNP with results that are accessible by PBE0r-D3 DFT calculations. The PBE0r- D3 DFT functional was also used for the energy and force calculations of the reference data set. Therefore, the HDNNP results should match the PBE0r-D3 DFT data. LixMn2O4 is used as positive electrode material in bat- teries, and Li intercalation and deintercalation are crucial processes. Consequently, the Li diﬀusion barrier is an im- portant property of this material. The barrier can be cal- culated using the nudged elastic band method. PBE0r- D3 DFT provides a barrier of 0.52 eV in the Li0.875Mn2O4 unit cell, which is in very good agreement with previous experimental NMR data yielding (0.5±0.1) eV [90]. The HDNNP predicts a barrier of 0.55 eV for the same min- imum energy path matching closely the DFT reference data as well as experiment. Apart from Li diﬀusion, the electrochemical potential is very important for battery applications and degrada- tion of LixMn2O4 during electrocatalysis of oxygen [91]. In the case of LixMn2O4 it depends on the Li content. From experiments it is known that the standard elec- trochemical potential of a Li/LixMn2O4 cell exhibits a plateau at about 4.1 V for", "page": 6, "position": 2}

To validate the vibrational ﬁngerprint of the sim- ulations the calculated phonon density of states [95] is compared with experimental Fourier-transform infrared and Raman spectra [96–99] in the Supplemental Material [67]. C. Structural changes due to lithium intercalation Li intercalation and deintercalation during discharge and charge of a battery includes structural expansion and contraction of LixMn2O4. This behaviour can be stud- ied in theory as well as in experiment. XRD experiments yield reliable and precise values for the lattice constants. However, the data are averaged over time and space hid- ing information about individual atomic environments. On the other hand, simulations rely on appropriate struc- tural models, but they reveal the underlying processes on an atomic scale with femtosecond resolution. Therefore, we will combine the advantages of both approaches by validating the HDNNP predictions ﬁrst on experimental and DFT data and then obtaining a detailed atomic scale understanding from our simulations. We start the investigation at 0 K to conﬁrm the HDNNP results for the optimized structures using PBE0r-D3 DFT reference data. The conventional LixMn2O4 unit cells are still accessible by DFT. In or- der to ﬁnd the global minimum Li distributions, with 1 4 ≤x ≤ 3 4, we performed GBHMC simulations using the HDNNP. The low-energy structures were then reopti- mized by DFT. The PBE0r-D3 results indicate that there is an eﬀective repulsion between the Li ions on neighbor- ing tetrahedral sites, leading to only every other tetra- hedral site being populated for 0 < x ≤1 2 in the most stable structures. Neighboring tetrahedral sites only be- come occupied by Li for x > 1 2. This change in occu- pation is presumably the reason for the plateaus of the electrochemical potentials in the region 0 < x < 1 2 and 1 2 < x < 1 as reported previously [8, 22]. The PBE0r-D3 equilibrium volumes of the LixMn2O4 unit cells, with x = 0, 0.5, 1, and 2, were determined using the Birch-Murnaghan equation of state [101, 102].

The optimized HDNNP results at 0 K reveal that the in- crease of the cubic lattice constant is slightly smaller if a Li fcc sublattice is already almost ﬁlled. As a conse- quence, a small dip at x = 0.5 is visible and the slope is reduced closer to x = 1 in Figure 3. Our in-situ XRD data yield a linear increase of 0.098 ˚A in the range from x = 0.5 to 1. This linear trend and the extrapolated result of the lattice constant at x = 0 of 8.027 ˚A are in good agreement with previous data [9, 15, 104].

On the one hand, this deviation of about 1% is caused by an overestimation of the lattice constants by the underlying PBE0r-D3 data compared to reality. On the other hand, it can either be explained by an error in experimental x determination or by stoichiometric devi- ations of the sample material from the ideal LixMn2O4 formula. In the case of our XRD data, the value for x is determined from the integrated in situ cell current and is only accurate to within ±0.02. Small changes of the parameters for the sample preparation process can easily inﬂuence the stoichiometry and thereby the lattice con- stant [105]. Using the HDNNP we can investigate the system also at lower temperatures. Figure 4 shows the cubic lattice constant acub as well as the individual lattice constants ax, ay, and az, each averaged over a 40 ns NpT MD sim- ulation at 150 K. At Li contents x ≤5 8 the time averaged values of ax, ay, and az are virtually equal to the cubic lattice constant acub. However, at larger Li contents the time averaged structure remains orthorhombic. This is in agreement with experimental measurements at low tem- peratures, which yield an orthorhombic structure with lattice constants 24.750, 24.801, and 8.190 ˚A at 130 K for x = 1 [10] corresponding to a distorted 3 × 3 × 1 su- percell of the unit cell at higher temperatures.

The XRDlit data have been taken from Reference [10]. The temperature region of the transition from an orthorhombic to a cubic crystal structure is high- lighted in blue (HDNNP) and yellow (XRDlit). Figure 5 (b) shows that the overall changes of the po- tential energy are quite small, which explains why the ﬂuctuations already happen at low temperatures. For lower Li contents, fewer Jahn-Teller distorted MnIIIO6 octahedra are present, and the orthorhombic structure becomes less favorable. As a consequence, the transition temperature of the ordered orthorhombic phase to the disordered cubic phase decreases. Consis- tently, in experiment it has been found that a higher O content, i.e. fewer MnIIIO6 octahedra, lead to a decrease of the transition temperature to the cubic phase [107]. This is because a higher oxygen-to-manganese ratio re- sults in higher oxidation states of manganese, i.e. more MnIV. Consequently, oxygen vacancies have the oppo- site eﬀect, yielding more MnIII, just as for an increased Li content. In fact, in Li rich spinels, Li1+xMn2−xO4, in which Mn is partially replaced by Li on octahedral sites, the cubic to orthorhombic transition can be suppressed to at least below T = 20 K [108]. D. Role of temperature In order to investigate the transition from an or- thorhombic to a cubic structure, we performed 40 ns NpT MD simulations of the LiMn2O4 unit cell in the range from 10 to 500 K. These were compared with ex- perimental measurements on LiMn2O4 which yield an orthorhombic crystal structure with lattice constants 24.750, 24.801, and 8.190 ˚A at 130 K and a cubic crys- tal structure with a lattice constant of 8.246 ˚A", "page": 10, "position": 0}

We start with a discussion of the spatially averaged cubic lattice constants acub in Figure 6 before we an- alyze the phase transition based on the time-averaged results of ax, ay, and az. Extrapolating the HDNNP re- sults of acub to 0 K yields 8.266 ˚A, which is identical to the value of the HDNNP optimized structure and agrees very well with the optimized PBE0r-D3 value of 8.238 ˚A. The HDNNP only slightly overestimates the lattice con- stant by about 0.3%. Our XRD result for acub at 130 K agrees within 0.1% with the data from the literature [10]. Moreover, the theoretical and experimental values are very similar. The deviations of PBE0r-D3 to our 0 K ex- trapolated XRD data and the 0 K extrapolated XRDlit data are smaller than 0.3% and 0.1%, respectively. The HDNNP predicts a thermal expansion of 4.4·10−5 ˚A K−1, which is in excellent agreement with our XRD result of 5.5·10−5 ˚A K−1 and the XRDlit result of 4.9·10−5 ˚A K−1. Looking at the individual lattice constants ax, ay, and az calculated by a time average over 40 ns NpT simu- lations using the HDNNP, we observe an orthorhombic structure at low temperatures whose lattice constants are similar to the optimized result at 0 K. As the tempera- ture is increased above about 200 K the individual lattice constants become more and more similar. Between about 260 and 330 K the structure ﬁnally converts to a cubic cell. Above 330 K the time averaged lattice constants are virtually equal. In experiment the transition from the orthorhombic to the cubic structure occurs between 280 and 320 K (yellow region in Figure 6) [10,", "page": 10, "position": 1}

In experiment the transition from the orthorhombic to the cubic structure occurs between 280 and 320 K (yellow region in Figure 6) [10, 109]. To investigate the transition in more detail, the lattice constants ax, ay, az, and acub as well as the potential en- ergy E as a function of the time t are given in Figures 7 (a) and (b) for the LiMn2O4 unit cell at 300 K determined in the same way as in Figure 5 for Li0.875Mn2O4 at 150 K. The analysis reveals that three LiMn2O4 structures with slightly diﬀerent lattice constants are present during the simulation, which result from diﬀerent MnIII/MnIV distributions. The crystal structure with highest or- thorhombicity, i.e., the largest splitting of the lattice constants (largest lattice constant of about 8.68 ˚A and two equal shorter ones), is energetically favored. For the second most stable structure the two shorter lattice con- stants are diﬀerent, for the third structure they are equal again. Therefore, the ﬁrst and the third structure are actually tetragonal. The Jahn-Teller distorted MnIIIO6 octahedra are aligned in all three structures. The elon- gated axis can be oriented in x, y, or z direction for each structure. The mean energy diﬀerence between the most stable structure and the other two structures, which have simi- lar energies, is about 0.02 eV per formula unit at 300 K, i.e., 3 meV atom−1. These small energy diﬀerences are similar to the RMSE of the HDNNP, and also in the or- der of the accuracy of the underlying DFT calculations. Therefore, these diﬀerent structure are eﬀectively almost degenerate in energy. However, the structure eﬀects the dynamics of the lattice constant swaps. Direct swaps of the orientation of the cell elongation of the most stable structure did not happen during the entire time of the 40 ns simulation. Instead,", "page": 10, "position": 2}

Overall, the E(t) curve of LiMn2O4 at 300 K exhibits higher ﬂuctuations than the one of Li0.875Mn2O4 at 150 K in Figure 5. In part, this can be attributed to the lower thermal energy at 150 K, but the energy diﬀerences be- tween the states of diﬀerent orthorhombicity are smaller and no required intermediate conﬁguration for a swap of orientation is observable for Li0.875Mn2O4 at 150 K. It seems that the missing Li atom resulting in one Jahn- Teller distorted MnIIIO6 octahedron less in Li0.875Mn2O4 reduces the activation energy required for the transition. It would be very interesting to compare the two com- positions at the same temperature, but we found that this is very diﬃcult. On the one hand, Li0.875Mn2O4 is far above the stability region at 300 K and undergoes very rapid changes of the Jahn-Teller distortions. On the other hand, LiMn2O4 essentially does not show any structural changes at 150 K. In general at temperatures below 150 K, orientational ﬂuctuations do not occur on nanosecond time scales. Therefore, the diﬀerent crystal orientations do not av- erage with time to a cubic cell. At higher temperatures, swaps become possible and the number of swaps per unit time increases with increasing temperature.

However, the MnIIIO6 octahedra are still Jahn-Teller distorted and the individual structures of the system remain orthorhombic. We note that in our simulations the transitions oc- cur very rapidly, but a comparison with experimental time scales has to be made with care. The reason is that the number of atoms in these simulations is much smaller than in macroscopic materials studied in exper- iment. Figure 7 shows the results obtained for a single unit cell containing eight MnIII ions, and a reorienta- tion of the Jahn-Teller distortions of such a system can happen very fast. Therefore, we will investigate larger systems in the next Section V E. Results of a 3 × 3 × 3 supercell reported below will show that the transition times increase with system size. E. Role of time and length scales At ﬁrst glance, the predicted transition temperature for LiMn2O4 in Figure 6 ﬁts reasonably well to experi- ment. However, if we consider that the XRD measure- ments average over much longer times than 40 ns, this agreement requires further analysis. Since the orienta- tional ﬂuctuations already start at temperatures lower than 260 K in the simulations, the HDNNP transition temperature to an averaged cubic structure might be ex- pected to shift to lower temperatures if the averaging is based on longer simulations including more transitions. Furthermore, the splitting of the orthorhombic lattice constants is considerably smaller in experiment than in theory (see Figure 6). This might be a consequence of us- ing just a single unit cell in our simulations, which leads to a correlation of the atomic motions and a reduced conﬁguration space of the MnIII and MnIV ions. Conse- quently, the corresponding Jahn-Teller distortions might exhibit an artiﬁcial superstructure in the system due to the ﬁnite simulation cell, and lead to larger splitting of the lattice constants.

XRD experiments at 130 K reveal a dis- torted 3 × 3 × 1 supercell of the high temperature cubic structure, which should be considered in the simulations. For these reasons, we will now investigate the impact of both the total simulation time as well as of the size of the simulation cell with respect to the transition temperature and the degree of orthorhombicity.

As expected, the mean cubic lattice constant acub is almost not aﬀected, but the averages of the individual lattice constants ax, ay, and az become more similar with in- creasing simulation time as more swaps of the elongation direction occur resulting in better statistics. Phase transitions in ﬁnite systems are often shifted in temperature and extend over a wider temperature range than in inﬁnite systems [110–112]. Finite system means in this context that the simulation cell has a ﬁnite size.

Figure 9 shows the dependence of the time-averaged lattice constants as a function of the system size for a simulation time of 20 ns up to a 3 × 3 × 3 supercell. Ac- cording to this plot, the transition occurs in a smaller temperature window for larger systems as expected. Av- eraging over a longer time will not lead to a large shift of the phase transition temperature anymore because es- pecially for the 3 × 3 × 3 supercell the transition is more sharply deﬁned. However, the transition temperature increases with system size, which is surprising because larger systems often have lower barriers due to the in- crease in available conﬁguration phase space. To understand this ﬁnding we have to look in more detail at the underlying atomic motions. Therefore, we plotted the distances of opposite O ions dx, dy, and dz in a typical MnO6 octahedron of a LiMn2O4 3 × 3 × 3 supercell at 300 K as a function of the time.

We can see that for short time inter- vals the dominant orientation of the largest d value along the y direction of the investigated octahedron changes to the z direction but it always rapidly returns to its initial orientation because the fully aligned conﬁguration is the minimum energy structure. This ﬂuctuation is also a rea- son for the already slowly decreasing average orthorhom- bicity of the 3×3×3 supercell above about 290 K (Figure 9). Furthermore, in Figure 10 it can be observed that the Jahn-Teller distorted MnIIIO6 octahedron with one large and two small d values changes to an undistorted octa- hedron with three very similar and small d values indi- cating MnIV.

Consequently, the MD simulations driven by the HDNNP provide re- sults that would also be obtained by DFT directly, in- cluding geometric processes corresponding to eg electron hops. Therefore, we can assign the observed geomet- ric changes to these electronic eﬀects, i.e., the Mn ion changes between the MnIII and MnIV states due to eg electron hops between the Mn sites as the Jahn-Teller distortion appears and disappears. This phenomenon al- ready starts at about 200 K. At low temperatures, no electron hopping and no dy- namic Jahn-Teller eﬀect are found, and the Jahn-Teller distorted octahedra are aligned in the simulations. On the other hand, at high temperatures the electron hop- ping and dynamic Jahn-Teller eﬀect are very fast. This leads to disorder in the MnIII/MnIV distribution and in the orientation of the Jahn-Teller distortions resulting in an on average cubic structure. Metastable structures ex- ist in 3 × 3 × 3 supercells in which the JT distortions are not fully aligned. This is caused by the increased conﬁg- uration space of the 3 × 3 × 3 supercell compared to the single unit cell. Using this information about the underlying atomic processes we will now develop a simple stochastic model to describe the temperature dependence of the lattice constants swaps as a function of the simulation cell size. In our model we only consider the Jahn-Teller distorted MnIIIO6 octahedra. These are elongated in x, y, or z directions. In the initial state, all octahedra are aligned in the same global direction, for example, the z direction. During a time step in the model, every octahedron can change its orientation to the x or y direction or stay in the z direction with given probabilities. After this distortion step, the x or y direction is considered as candidate for the new global orientation of the system depending on in which direction more changes occurred, for example, the x direction.

After this distortion step, the x or y direction is considered as candidate for the new global orientation of the system depending on in which direction more changes occurred, for example, the x direction. In case of a tie, the direction is selected randomly. The probability that a Jahn-Teller distorted octahe- dron changes its orientation to the candidate direction for the new global orientation at the given time step in the model is p(T). This probability per time step, i.e., the rate constant, is the same for each octahedron and only a function of the temperature T. At higher tempera- tures the frequency of swaps is larger because the energy barrier can be overcome more easily, and consequently also the frequency of swaps to a new speciﬁc direction is higher. If a critical fraction of the Jahn-Teller distorted octa- hedra changes the orientations to the candidate for the new global orientation in the same time step in the model, the orientation of the entire structure changes, i.e., also the orientations of the other octahedra are reorientated. Here, we set this critical fraction to 3 8 = 37.5% of the n sites, i.e., three out of eight MnIIIO6 sites in case of a single LiMn2O4 unit cell. We chose this threshold be- cause during the MD trajectories of a single LiMn2O4 unit cell analyzed after each picosecond, we only observed structures with at most one or two Jahn-Teller distorted octahedra that do not align in the majority direction. Structures with three or four octahedra diﬀering in their alignment from the majority direction are only present on a femtosecond time scale. A similar maximum fraction has also been found in larger supercells.

We tested the model also with diﬀerent critical fractions, which led to the same conclusions, i.e., the threshold de- pendence is weak. If the new orientations of the Jahn-Teller distorted oc- tahedra do not lead to a change of the global orientation of the system, the initial state is restored with every octa- hedron aligned in the original direction. For initial struc- tures with a high degree of alignment of the Jahn-Teller distorted octahedra as in our simulations, the system will usually be driven back to the aligned minimum conﬁgu- ration unless the temperature is much higher than the transition temperature. The time step in the model is completed after this relaxation and the next time step follows. The approximations of this model lead to a simple bi- nomial distribution because the Jahn-Teller distorted oc- tahedra can either change to a new global orientation or stay in the old orientation. The probability for a swap of the global orientation is then given by Pn(p) = n X k= 3n 8 \u0012n k \u0013 pk(1 −p)n−k , (5) where k equals the number of orientations changed in the candidate direction for the new global orientation at the given time step in the model. For a swap of the global orientation, k has to be larger than or equal to the threshold. Figure 11 shows the dependence of Pn on p. Because p is monotonically increasing with temperature we can qualitatively compare the transitions in Figures 9 and 11. Our simple probabilistic model in Figure 11 shows that at low temperatures, successful swaps of the lat- tice constants are more likely for small cells. For larger cells, swaps are only possible at elevated temperatures equivalent to an increased p, i.e., closer to the transition", "page": 13, "position": 2}

Larger simulation cells would be required for an exhaustive exploration of the full conﬁg- uration space. In Figure 9, we see that the averaging at higher temperatures of a smaller cell is not as good as for a larger cell which means that the transition window is broader for the small cell. The data of the 3×3×3 super- cell simulations are the best and narrowest estimate for the orthorhombic to cubic transition temperature. They yield a transition window from 350 to 380 K, which is about 60 K higher than the experimental result. F.

However, this peak was only present because the initial MnIII/MnIV distribution in the simulations is only the second low- est minimum conﬁguration which we found in unit cell calculations. If the lowest minimum is employed, this peak is not present. Consequently, the simulations below about 240 K are dependent on their initial conﬁguration.

The data represent a typical interval of a 20 ns simulation. of spins is lost due to thermal energy. In our case, the alignment of the Jahn-Teller distortions is lost. For the 3 × 3 × 3 supercell, an additional peak in the heat capacity at 290 K is observed in Figure 12 which matches the beginning of the decrease of the orthorhom- bicity in Figure 9. The frequency of electron hopping dur- ing the simulations increases at this transition tempera- ture. Probably the heat capacity peak at 290 K can be attributed to a charge ordering transition which will be analysed in more detail in a subsequent study of the elec- tronic dynamics. In the single unit cell and the 2 × 2 × 2 supercell the peak at 290 K is not observable. This might be a consequence of the limited conﬁguration space with a smaller number of minima and too high collectivity. The increase of the conﬁguration space becomes obvi- ous if we compare the time evolution of the lattice con- stants at the phase transition of the 3×3×3 supercell in Figure 13 with the behavior of a single unit cell in Figure 7. Figures 13 (a) and (b) show that there is a much larger variety of metastable states present for the 3×3×3 super- cell compared to the single unit cell with only three dif- ferent metastable states and some defect and transitions states occurring in MD simulations at ﬁnite temperatures (see Figure 7).

The metastable states of the single unit cell are all orthorhombic crystal structures. The swaps of the orientations lead to a time-averaged cubic struc- ture but the Jahn-Teller distortions are still aligned in the metastable states. Therefore, a spatial average does not lead to a cubic structure in case of the single unit cell. Due to more conﬁgurational ﬂexibility in case of the 3×3×3 supercell, the changing orientations of the Jahn- Teller distorted MnIIIO6 octahedra above the transition temperature lead to more or less orthorhombic 3 × 3 × 3 supercells depending on the alignment of the individual Jahn-Teller distortions. Metastable conﬁgurations exist which are much less orthorhombic than the fully aligned global minimum structure at 0 K. The geometric mean of these lattice constants is also about 0.015 ˚A smaller than of the highly orthorhombic structures. Both improve the agreement with experiment. Figure 13 (b) shows that the mean energy of these structures is higher. The sudden changes in volume and energy suggest that the phase transition is of ﬁrst order, which is in agreement with previous experimental results [113]. The sampling of the 3 × 3 × 3 supercell at the phase transition temperature also leads to an answer to the remaining question why our simulations predict a low- temperature orthorhombic structure with larger lattice constant splittings than measured in experiment. For the single unit cell, only conﬁgurations with fully aligned Jahn-Teller distortions are metastable. But we observe in Figure 13 (b) that the mean potential energy of the less orthorhombic 3 × 3 × 3 supercell structures is only about 2 meV higher than the fully aligned minimum structure. Consequently, metastable conﬁgurations ex- ist for the 3 × 3 × 3 supercell energetically close to the aligned minimum conﬁguration, in which", "page": 15, "position": 1}

Consequently, metastable conﬁgurations ex- ist for the 3 × 3 × 3 supercell energetically close to the aligned minimum conﬁguration, in which the Jahn-Teller distortions are not fully aligned in one direction. Thus for even larger cells, (partially) ordered conﬁgurations with diﬀerent orientations of Jahn-Teller distortions de- pendent on the Mn sites might exist which are energet- ically or entropically favored over the aligned conﬁgu- ration. This would result in a less orthorhombic low- temperature structure. The outcome of previously published high-resolution diﬀraction experiments of LiMn2O4 [10, 20, 87, 88] is ba- sically a 3 × 3 × 1 supercell of the cubic cell with ﬁve diﬀerent Mn sites. Three are attributed to be MnIII sites and two are MnIV sites. As the ratio of these sites does not obey the 1:1 ratio of MnIII and MnIV ions, eight MnIV ions in a 3×3×1 supercell are placed on MnIII sites [87]. Each of the MnIII sites exhibits a Jahn-Teller distortion in a diﬀerent direction [20]. The crystal structure is or- thorhombic because the ratio of the MnIII sites is 1:2:2 and the eight remaining MnIV ions cannot be equally dis- tributed over these sites. Therefore, the low-temperature orthorhombic structure is a partially ordered conﬁgura-", "page": 15, "position": 2}

As a consequence, a single simulation cell, which fully represents this experimentally determined complex charge and Jahn-Teller order, has to be much larger than the 3 × 3 × 1 supercell. Otherwise the positions of the MnIV ions on the MnIII sites exhibit an artiﬁcial super- structure, which might lead to energy penalties and to a higher orthorhombicity. The experimental crystal structure cannot be directly recalculated because it includes too many Jahn-Teller distorted MnO6 octahedra, since the averaged bond dis- tances hide the MnIV ions on MnIII sites. Instead, we investigated an ensemble of partially ordered conﬁgura- tions. We performed 10 ns NpT simulations at 150 K using initial structures obtained from a NpT simulation of the 3×3×3 supercell at 400 K. These systems are usu- ally trapped in diﬀerent local minima and cannot relax to a fully aligned minimum structure in contrast to similar simulations employing a single unit cell. The correspond- ing structures are less orthorhombic because the Jahn- Teller distortions are not fully aligned. We minimized the lowest local minimum structure found in these sim- ulations at 150 K. We note that there might also be dif- ferent conﬁgurations with an even lower mean potential energy, but due to the large conﬁguration space compared to the minimum structures of the unit cell at low tem- peratures, the search for the global minimum becomes a very complex task. Therefore, the following results refer to a calculation of a speciﬁc conﬁguration. The mini- mization yields lattice constants of 24.751, 24.806, and 24.345 ˚A. These are in good agreement with the experi- mental 3 × 3 × 3 supercell of LiMn2O4 at 130 K with lat- tice constants of 24.750, 24.801, and 24.570 ˚A [10]. The energy is only 3.9 meV atom−1 higher than the aligned minimum conﬁguration.

VI. CONCLUSION In this ﬁrst application of a HDNNP to a system con- taining a transition metal in multiple oxidation states accompanied by Jahn-Teller distortions, we demonstrate that this method is able to signiﬁcantly narrow the gap between DFT and experimental observations. The HDNNP method captures the complex potential energy surface of LixMn2O4, enabling simulations with an accu- rate description of the Jahn-Teller dynamics. The exper- imentally measured orthorhombic to cubic transition is reproduced by the HDNNP simulations revealing infor- mation about the underlying atomistic dynamics. Study- ing this transition by electronic structure methods like DFT directly would be prohibitively expensive, while the HDNNP allows to bridge this gap by increasing the time and length scales of molecular dynamics. In this way, the transition can now be observed in the simulations, although the studied atomistic processes are rare close to the transition temperature. Excellent agreement between theory and experiment is found for further properties, such as the lattice constants of both crystal structures which deviate by less than 1% from experiment, and for lattice expansion with increas- ing Li content as well as temperature. Moreover, a series of other properties such as the lithium diﬀusion barrier, diﬀerences of the electrochemical potential, and phonon frequencies is very similar in experiment and theory. This work proves that the HDNNP method is able to repre- sent a system with multiple oxidation states retaining the accuracy of the underlying ﬁrst principles method and enabling insights into the atomic dynamics from femto- to nanosecond resolution.
