Abstract We performed density functional theory (DFT) calculations for a bi-layered heterostructure com- bining a graphene layer with a MoS2 layer with and without intercalated Li atoms. Our calcu- lations demonstrate the importance of the van der Waals (vdW) interaction, which is crucial for forming stable bonding between the layers. Our DFT calculation correctly reproduces the linear dispersion, or Dirac cone, feature at the Fermi energy for the isolated graphene monolayer and the band gap for the MoS2 monolayer. For the combined graphene/MoS2 bi-layer, we ob- serve interesting electronic structure and density of states (DOS) characteristics near the Fermi en- ergy, showing both the gap like features of the MoS2 layer and in-gap states with linear disper- sion contributed mostly by the graphene layer. ∗To whom correspondence should be addressed †Theoretical Division, Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, New Mexico 87545 ‡Center for Integrated Nanotechnologies, Sandia Na- tional Laboratories, Albuquerque, New Mexico 87185 ¶Center for Integrated Nanotechnologies, Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, New Mexico 87545 §Theoretical Division, Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, New Mexico 87545 Our calculated total density of states (DOS) in this vdW heterostructure reveals that the graphene layer signiﬁcantly contributes to pinning the Fermi energy at the center of the band gap of MoS2. We also ﬁnd that intercalating Li ions in between the layers of the graphene/MoS2 heterostructure enhances the binding energy through orbital hy- bridizations between cations (Li adatoms) and an- ions (graphene and MoS2 monolayers).

In this re- spect, both graphene and MoS2 monolayers have demonstrated potential as materials for design- ing superior electrodes with high speciﬁc capac- ity. High capacities from 600 to 1000 mAh/g has been observed for single atomically thin graphene nanosheets.3–6 Moreover, several experi- mental works7,8 on transition metals and metal ox- ides supported on graphene as negative electrodes have shown enhanced performance for LIB. On the other hand, the usage of a transition metal sul- ﬁde MoS2, with graphene like structure, was pro- posed as a potential anode material in a patent in 1980.9 Despite its high insertion capacity (≈1000 mAh/g), MoS2 alone has not been realized as the primary anode material due to its low cyclic stabil- ity.4 In this Letter, we construct van der Waals layers10 as the ‘intercalating compound’4 using graphene and MoS2 bilayer. Our density func- tional theory (DFT) calculations show orbital hy- bridization between the layers, where the vdW interaction dominantly contributes to the stabil- ity of the heterostructure with signiﬁcant binding energy. A shift in chemical potential is also ob- served in our calculations for the graphene/MoS2 bilayer when compared with the isolated graphene or MoS2 mono layers. Particularly noticeable is the linear dispersion in the DOS near the Fermi energy of the graphene/MoS2 bilayer, which re- sembles that of the isolated graphene monolayer. Thus, combining graphene with a MoS2 layer helps to pin the chemical potential near the gap center of MoS2 and creates semi-metal like elec- tronic structure in the heterostructure.

Our DFT calculation shows an even larger bind- ing energy when the graphene/MoS2 bilayer are intercalated with Li ions. The higher stability in such heterostructure makes it a potential candidate for designing LIB anodes with larger speciﬁc ca- pacity and longer cycle life-time. The hybridiza- tion between carbon p, lithium s, and molyb- denum d orbitals causes the chemical potential to shift into the d-bands making the Li interca- lated heterostructure fully metallic. The result- ing enhancement of the conductivity in lithiated graphene/MoS2 heterostructure is highly desirable for the anode materials in LIB. Earlier theoretical works11 have demonstrated similar chemical potential shift using various adatoms in addition to Li, for single and bilayer graphene. For a related graphene and MoS2 het- erostructure, Miwa et al.12 reported the DFT cal- culated density of states without observing any Fermi energy pinning or linear dispersion near the gap center of MoS2. In this Letter, we have demonstrated, for the ﬁrst time, the interesting Dirac dispersion characteristics in the electronic DOS of graphene/MoS2 bilayer at the Fermi en- ergy. Although the lithiation makes the compound metallic as expected, discharging of LIB gradually turns the anode into semimetal while retaining the stability. In the language of electrochemistry, such processes can be presented by the following two half-reactions:13 In anode: xLiC6/MoS2 charge ⇆ discharge xLi+ +xe−+C6/MoS2, and in cathode: Li1−xCoO2 +xLi+ +xe− charge ⇆ discharge LiCoO2 Therefore, our proof-of-principles calculations demonstrate the Li intercalated graphene/MoS2 bi- layer as potential candidates for designing high 2", "page": 1, "position": 1}

Computational Methods All calculations in this paper are performed using the plane-wave pseudo-potential code VASP14–16 under the generalized gradient approximation of Perdew, Burke, and Ernzerhof (PBE).17 For atomic core-levels, we have used projected aug- mented wave (PAW) potentials18,19 treating the 2s2p of C, 2s of Li, 4p5s4d of Mo, and 3s3p of S as the explicit valence electrons. For all calcula- tions, the total energy during electronic relaxation is converged to 10−6 eV while the force/atom dur- ing ionic relaxation is converged to 0.01eV/Å. A maximum energy cutoff of 500 eV is used for plane-wave basis set. In the xy-plane, 6x6 unit cells of graphene and 5x5 unit cells of MoS2 are placed in a super-cell with a=b=16 Å, c=40 Å, α = β=90◦, and γ=120◦. In our calculations, the Li atoms are intercalated between the graphene and MoS2 layers at the cen- ter of the graphene honeycomb sites. For different metal ions, this location has been shown to have the largest binding energies by Chan et al.11 We have placed 12 Li atoms homogeneously in our super-cell. This sparse distribution of Li atoms approximates the interaction of isolated Li atoms with graphene and MoS2. The distance between Li atoms are large enough (≈7 Å) to minimize the orbital overlap between neighboring Li atoms. To incorporate the vdW interaction between the graphene and MoS2 layers, we have used optB86b-vdW functional where the exchange functionals were optimized for the correlation part.20 Therefore, the LDA correlation part present in the PBE functional is removed by using the pa- rameter AGGAC = 0.000 in the input ﬁle in order to avoid double-counting. Calculations for the isolated 6x6 graphene, 5x5 MoS2, and 6x6 graphene + Li adatoms were per- formed using the same sized super-cell. For ionic relaxation of graphene + Li , graphene + MoS2, and graphene + Li + MoS2 systems, we have used the Γ point to sample the Brillouin zone, while for all other calculations, e.g., DOS and dielectric functions, we used equally distributed 80 k-points in the irreducible Brillouin zone.", "page": 2, "position": 0}

Results and Discussion To estimate the adsorption energy, we deﬁne, ∆E = EA +EB −EA+B, (1) where EA+B is the total energy of the A+B com- posite system, and EA/EB is the total energy of the isolated A/B constituent system. In Table 1, we present our DFT calculated total energy for graphene, MoS2, the graphene/MoS2 heterostructure, and the lithiated graphene/MoS2 heterostructure. Using Eq. (1), we calculate the binding energy between graphene and MoS2 bi- layer with and without Li ions in between. We have 25 Mo atoms in our supercell, and scaled the total adsorption energy to obtain ∆E per Mo ion. We ﬁnd the ∆E per Mo ion is enhanced by about three times when Li intercalation is consid- ered. Without Li atoms, the graphene and MoS2 layers form a physisorbed heterostructure with ≈ 0.1873 eV adsorption energy per Mo ion, where the most important contribution comes from the surface van der Waals interaction. The adsorp- tion energy signiﬁcantly increases in the presence of intercalated Li ions, and these higher adsorp- tion energies (0.6 eV per Mo ion or 1.26 eV per Li ion) suggest a more stabile structure. At the same time, the small change in atomic positions during the ionic relaxation clearly indicates the process is dominantly van der Waals driven physisorption. Thus, the Li ions are easily separable and lithiation process can be reversed. This is a highly desirable criterion for LIBs during ionization-deionization process which enhances the cycle lifetime of bat- teries. The electronic structure of the isolated graphene and MoS2 monolayers is changed near the Fermi energy when they are assembled to form a van der Waals heterostructure.

On the other hand, MoS2 monolayer is a direct gap semiconductor with ≈1.8 eV band gap.23 In our DFT calculations, this band gap is estimated to be 1.4 eV as shown in 2(b). Due to the unﬁlled d-orbitals in Mo atoms, the semi-local DFT func- tionals are inadequate, and one can incorporate many-body corrections such as GW24 or hybrid functionals HSE25 which accounts for the missing 0.4 eV band gap in the conventional DFT. In the present proof-of-principles calculations, our ﬁnd- ings should remain unaffected from such band gap correction, while incorporating these corrections in large supercell with vdW interaction would greatly increase the computational cost. There- fore, we neglect such band-gap corrections in our calculations. We plot the total DOS of graphene/MoS2 in 2(c) with solid red curve.

Such pinning of EF can- not be identiﬁed in the isolated MoS2 monolayer where the exact location of the chemical potential is arbitrary inside the gap. The effect of lithiation on the DOS is shown in 2(d). Using the similar scaling, we compare the total DOS with that of the partial d, p, and s orbitals of Mo, C, and Li atoms. The Mo and C atoms are selected from the MoS2 and graphene layers, which are closest to a partic- ular Li atom. These atoms are labeled in 1(d). However, we ﬁnd the DOS is no longer symmetric in the presence of Li adatoms. Due to a strong hy- bridization between Li s, Mo d and C p orbitals as well as the electron doping effect of Li, the chem- ical potential is shifted towards the unoccupied d bands, and thus, composite system becomes metal- lic. This implies that the loss of electrons from Li to the graphene and MoS2 layers leads to a strong Coulomb interaction between Li ions and charged layers. It explains our observation of an increased binding energy with Lithiation. Our calculations for the real and imaginary part of dielectric function are presented in 3.

Conclusions In this Letter, adsorption of graphene on a MoS2 monolayer is studied using DFT-based ﬁrst- principles theory with and without intercalated Li atoms.
