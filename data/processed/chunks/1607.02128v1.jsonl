The results reveal that, contrary to conventional belief, the phase evolution in the electrode is symmetrical during discharge and charge. However, the spatial evolution of the electrochemically active phases, which is controlled by reaction kinetics, is different. We further propose that the voltage hysteresis in the FeF3 electrode is kinetic in nature. It is the result of Ohmic voltage drop, reaction overpotential, and different spatial distributions of electrochemically-active phases (i.e. compositional inhomogeneity). Therefore, the large hysteresis can be expected to be mitigated by rational design and optimization of material microstructure and electrode architecture to improve the energy efficiency of lithium-ion batteries based on conversion chemistry. INTRODUCTION Lithium-ion battery (LIB) technology has revolutionized portable electronics and been considered a promising solution for future large-scale energy applications.1, 2 Current LIBs function through intercalation chemistry, which consists of topotactic insertion/removal of Li+ into/from the host lattice of electrode materials, for example LiCoO2, LiFePO4, LiNi1/3Mn1/3Co1/3 O2, and graphite.3 Despite good rate capability and long cycle-life, the energy density achievable with intercalation (500600 Wh kg1 active material) is inherently limited by the number of interstitial sites in the host lattice (typically < 1 per formula).1 New battery materials and/or new chemistries with higher specific energy densities are clearly desirable.1, 3-5", "page": 1, "position": 0}

The last decade has witnessed tremendous advances in preparation of nanostructured conversion electrode materials that exhibit high specific energy densities (and power capability).4 However, their practical applications have been deterred by an unusually large voltage hysteresis (voltage gap) between discharge and charge steps. Similar hysteresis has also been observed in other high energy-density battery chemistries such as Li-O2 and Li-sulfur (S). This hysteresis of conversion electrode materials range from several hundred mV to ~2 V,4 comparable to that of a Li-O2 battery5 but much higher than that of a Li-S battery (200300 mV)5 or a typical intercalation electrode material (several tens mV)12 at similar rates. It leads to a high degree of round-trip energy inefficiency (< 80% energy efficiency) that is unacceptable in practical applications. To overcome this challenge, it is necessary to understand its physical origins, which have remained elusive, as most work has focused on material synthesis and electrochemical testing4. Iron fluorides (FeF3 and FeF2) are among the most studied conversion electrode materials due to their very high specific energy densities (> 1000 Wh kg1) and better reversibility as compared with other fluorides (such as CuF2), especially after nanostructuring and/or mixing with conductive carbon.9-11, 13-26 Notably, FeF3 is one of the very few conversion electrode materials27, 28 whose voltage hysteresis has been previously studied, by either density functional theory calculations within the generalized gradient approximation (DFT-GGA)14 or electrochemical measurements.19, 20 The current belief is that a large portion of the voltage hysteresis originates from the asymmetric reaction pathways during discharge and charge and", "page": 2, "position": 0}

These discrepancies in reaction pathways have constrained the understanding of voltage hysteresis and therefore need to be reconciled through systematic and definitive studies into both thermodynamic and kinetic aspects of the reaction mechanism.

RESULTS Iron fluoride model samples We prepared FeF3 NWs18 and MWs26 according to previous work and synthesized the FeF2 NWs for the first time via thermal reduction of FeF3 NWs using a small amount of glucose at 450 C under flowing argon (see Methods for synthetic details; see morphology in Figure S1a-c). The phase identities of these samples are confirmed using powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD, Figure S1d). Further TEM characterization reveals that all of these wire samples are polycrystalline and made of attached particle domains (Figure S2). We chose these materials as the model samples because of their higher electrochemical activity at room temperature compared with other iron fluoride samples.11, 15, 16 They can all reach near theoretical capacity at a moderate current rate (Figure S3), which is critical for finishing the in situ experiments in a reasonable amount of beam time and collecting useful mechanistic information. In Situ XAS on an FeF2 electrode We first studied the reaction mechanism of an FeF2 electrode using in situ XAS as a comparison to the FeF3 electrode, because Li-FeF2 is a simpler conversion system (ideally only Fe2+ and Fe0 are involved) than Li-FeF3 (Fe3+, Fe2+, and Fe0 are involved).

After the constant-current charging step, a constant-voltage charging step was applied at 4.2 V until the current dropped to ~C/50.

For example, the Fe-related peak shifted towards smaller R values as the discharge reaction proceeded, decreasing from ~2.3 Å (~ 0 Li insertion) to ~2.1 Å (~1.99 Li insertion).

This rutile phase most likely nucleates first at the interface between the electrolyte and the active particles (now made of LiF/Fe nanocomposites), where Li+ ions are extracted and transferred into the electrolyte most easily.

In discharge region I in Figure 2a-c (xLi = 00.78 Li per FeF3), the Fe3+ in FeF3 is gradually reduced to Fe2+ with Li uptake, as evidenced by the shift in absorption edge of the XANES spectra. Meanwhile, the change in EXAFS peak position and intensity indicates that the local structure deviates from that of the original rhombohedral FeF3 and becomes increasingly rutile- like, which resembles rutile FeF2 after 0.78 Li insertion (Figure S8). We further carried out EXAFS fitting and found out that the first set of data collected after discharge region I (xLi = 0.79) could be best modeled using the scattering paths generated from rutile FeF2 (see fitting results in Figure S9 and Table S2). For the FeF3 electrode at a state of lithiation of xLi = 0.79, the coordination numbers are slightly smaller while coordination distances are slightly larger than those of rutile FeF2 standard, indicative of a slightly defective rutile structure.

We also studied the phase and microstructural evolution of the FeF3 NW electrode by in situ TEM electron diffraction (ED) and scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), which show results consistent with the in situ XAS experiments. The in situ ED patterns (Figure S11 and Movie S1) show that the FeF3 NWs were first lithiated to form rutile FeF2 phase before full reduction to metallic Fe. The in situ STEM (Movie S2) shows that the lithiation reaction initiated from the surface and propagated toward the core of each electrochemically active domain. Notably, after being fully lithiated, the microstructure of the FeF3 NW electrode is similar to that of the fully lithiated FeF2 nanoparticles.16, 17 Nanocomposites consisting of bicontinuous LiF/Fe networks were formed (Figure 2f). The average size of the Fe domains is 23 nm. As the starting point for the charge process, this microstructure also provides the key to understanding the phase evolution during delithiation. The charge reaction (delithiation) most likely first initiates from the surface of the active particles (now made of LiF/Fe nanocomposites), where Li+ ions are extracted and transferred into the electrolyte most easily. We performed LCA (See fitting examples in Figure S6b and fitting parameters in Table S3) to estimate the relative mole fraction of different Fe oxidation states (Figure 2e) during the discharge (and charge) of the FeF3 electrode. We found that a noticeable amount of Fe (> 5%) already existed at xLi = 0.61 and Fe3+, Fe2+, and Fe coexisted in the electrode between xLi = 0.61 to 2.15 (<5 % Fe3+, Figure 2e, Table S3). This result indicates that the reduction of Fe2+ to Fe had already started on the outside (Fe2+-containing region) surface before the first reduction (Fe3+ to Fe2+) fully finished in the whole electrochemically active particle. An interesting question is what Li composition in the Li-FeF3 system is necessary for metallic Fe to begin forming, since different values xLi = 0.75, 0.92, or 1.0 were previously reported in FeF3/carbon nanocomposite", "page": 10, "position": 0}

The FeF3 MW/Li cell was cycled at the same rate as the FeF3 NW/Li cell, but its voltage profile (Figure 2d) shows different features. The first sloping plateau at higher voltages (region I) is much shorter but the second flat plateau (region II) is much longer than those of the FeF3 NW/Li cell. Accordingly, the XANES spectra and EXAFS patterns of the FeF3 MW electrode (Figure S12a-c) is also different from those of the NW electrode (Figure 2a-c). LCA fittings performed on the XANES spectra (fitting examples in Figure S6c and fitting parameters in Table S4) reveal that a noticeable amount of metallic Fe started to exist at xLi = 0.31 (> 5% mole fraction) and Fe3+, Fe2+, and Fe coexisted in the electrode until xLi = 2.41 (Fe3+ < 5%, Figure S13 and Table S4). We also note that the energy density of the Li-FeF3 MW battery is lower than the Li-FeF3 NW battery due to the loss of the high voltage plateau. The comparison between the reaction behavior of FeF3 NWs and MWs reveals how reaction homogeneity and voltage profiles (energy density) are affected by the size of the active domains, which correlates with the reaction kinetics. As shown by the in situ STEM experiment (Movie S2), the lithiation reaction of FeF3 proceeds from the surface to the core of each electrochemically active domain. In FeF3 MWs that consist of larger active domains (and thus smaller surface area) than the NWs, the applied current (1/10 C) is more likely to exceed what the reaction kinetics (Li+ and/or electron transport) can keep up with. Therefore, the Fe2+- containing rutile phase produced in the initial reduction (lithiation) on the outside is further lithiated to produce LiF and Fe early at xLi = 0.31 before the interior FeF3 domains can begin to react (see schematic illustration in Figure S14).

By contrast, in the NWs, faster reaction kinetics (shorter distance for Li+ and/or electron transport) allow the first reduction step (Fe3+Fe2+) to further complete before Fe formation (at xLi = 0.61). Furthermore, in the FeF3/carbon nanocomposite samples reported previously,14, 15, 25 even smaller particle size, better electrical contact afforded by the carbon matrix, and small current densities likely facilitate the first reduction to complete even more, which explains the initial formation of Fe approaching xLi at 1.0. We note that xLi is better considered a measure of the state of lithiation averaged within the entire electrode and it does not necessarily reflect the stoichiometric information of the LixFeF3 phase that readily extrudes Fe upon further lithiation, especially in the kinetically limited situations (such as the MWs). It is possible that in all cases Fe starts to form at y = 1, but the existence of unreacted FeF3 phase at the core of the active particles leads to xLi < 1. These results illustrate the critical role of reaction kinetics and inhomogeneity in governing the conversion processes and voltage curves for the FeF3 conversion electrode and have implications for other electrode materials operating through sequential multiple-step processes. Additionally, we compared the electrochemical capacity with the capacity estimated from the LCA fittings for the FeF2 and FeF3 NW electrode and found reasonable matches (Figure S15). These results suggest that electrolyte decomposition (or any other non-metal-center side reactions) does not contribute significantly to the observed discharge capacity in the iron fluoride conversion electrodes studied in this work (when low cut-off voltage  1 V is used). This reaction behavior is different from metal oxide conversion electrodes that are discharged to lower voltages (< 1 V),28, 30-33 in which additional capacity was often observed.

These results provide clear evidence that a rutile-FeF2-like phase is formed during charge of the FeF3 electrode. These findings are actually consistent with previous results from ex situ NMR and PDF experiments15 but in disagreement with the DFT-GGA based reaction mechanism14, 17, which suggested formation of Fe3+-containing intermediate phases rather than the FeF2 intermediate during charge. In fact, we only observed oxidation of Fe2+ into Fe3+ when the cell voltage exceeded ~3.3 V in charge region IV (Figure 2a-c, xLi = 1.030.53 Li per FeF3), as evidenced by the absorption edge further shifting toward higher energies. Further, the local structure at the final state (0.53 Li per FeF3) still resembles rutile FeF2. According to EXAFS patterns, the Fe-F peak position is slightly smaller than that in rutile FeF2 but larger than that in rhombohedral FeF3 (Figure 2c) in R value. Therefore, we suggest that some trirutile Li0.5FeF3 may exist at the end of the charge process. DFT calculations and reaction pathway of FeF3 electrodes To corroborate the experimental findings, we performed a detailed multicomponent phase analysis using DFT calculations of materials in the Li-Fe-F ternary system. The DFT calculations were performed using GGA, GGA+U, and hybrid HSE functionals34, which have been shown to more accurately reproduce experimental formation energies and Li insertion voltages for transition metal-containing compounds than GGA.35, 36 The Li-Fe-F phase diagrams calculated using GGA and GGA+U are shown in Figure S17 and S18, respectively.

When examining the stable FeF2 lithiation path (green dotted line in Figure 3a), FeF2 immediately begins to dissociate upon lithiation to precipitate metallic Fe and LiF. This three- phase region persists over the entire lithiation path until xLi = 2, at which point the reduction from Fe2+ to metallic Fe is complete and produces a two phase mixture of metallic Fe and LiF. This lithiation path is consistent with the in situ XAS results on the FeF2 electrode (Figure 1, region I) and the previous DFT-LD-GGA+U calculations29 but clearly different the one predicted by DFT-GGA calculations.14, 17 In delithiation of the Fe/LiF (1:2 in mole ratio), FeF2 should be formed as the stable phase but Li0.5FeF3 may also be produced from FeF2 if there is excess LiF, which is likely the case at the surface of the active particles and indeed observed by the in situ XAS experiment (Figure 1, region II).", "page": 14, "position": 0}

Upon lithiation to xLi = 0.25 (Li0.25FeF3), the pristine rhombohedral FeF3 phase is no longer stable, and a phase change to the defected trirutile structure occurs. This defected trirutile phase is stable up to xLi = 0.5 (Li0.5FeF3), after which dissociation to FeF2 and LiF occurs because no more interstitial sites for lithium insertion are available. When xLi = 1, all Fe3+ has been reduced to Fe2+ and the system is a two-phase mixture of FeF2 and LiF. Further lithiation promotes the reduction of Fe2+ to metallic Fe, which is exactly the same process as the lithiation of FeF2. In delithiation of Fe/LiF (1:3 in mole ratio), FeF2 should be formed as the stable phase first; Li0.5FeF3 can be produced later from the FeF2 and the remaining LiF.

We note that kinetic limitations can cause one reaction not proceed completely over the entire particle domain before the subsequent one being forced to initiate in the pre-reacted region under galvanostatic condition, causing compositional inhomogeneity and less symmetrical phase evolution profile (FeF3 MWs vs NWs, Figure S13 vs Figure 2e). This new proposed understanding is clearly different from the one proposed previously based on DFT-GGA calculations,14, 17 which was the basis for understanding the large voltage hysteresis in FeF3 and other conversion electrode materials. The previous model assumes that the electrochemical reaction is controlled by the slow diffusion of Fe so that Fe is oxidized to the highest oxidation state (Fe3+) during charge in order to maximize lithium extraction. A series of Fe3+-containing phases, such as spinel Li15/8Fe3+ 3/8F3, ilmenite Li3/2Fe3+ 1/2F3, and rutile Li3/4Fe3+ 3/4F3 are predicted to form sequentially during charge, which constituents a fundamentally different reaction pathway from that taken during discharge (reduction of rutile Fe2+F2 like phase to Fe).14, 17 This model provided a seemingly reasonable explanation for the voltage hysteresis because the presence of different phases (and with Fe at different oxidation states) during discharge and charge would indeed lead to different potentials. However, our new mechanistic understanding clearly suggests that other mechanisms are responsible for the voltage hysteresis.

In the discharge half-cycle (red curve), as soon as the current is removed, the voltage first suddenly increases a small amount, and then gradually increases as the electrode approaches equilibrium condition.37 The opposite occurs in the charge half-cycle (blue curve in Figure 4b). We found that the voltage after the 4 h relaxation (Vrelax, black dashed lines in Figure 4a) correlates with the composition of the electrodes inferred from the in situ XAS results. For example, since the Fe3+F3 phase in the MW electrode is reacted more slowly than that in the NW electrode during discharge, Vrelax observed in the MW electrode is higher initially (black dashed lines in Figure 4a). As the Fe3+F3 phase is consumed, the two Vrelax curves of the MW and NW electrodes become more comparable. Figure 4c shows how much the voltage relaxes after 4 h for the FeF3 NW and MW electrodes, respectively, at different states of lithiation. During discharge, the voltage relaxes a lot more in the MW electrode than the NW electrode (Figure 4c), which is a direct consequence of inhomogeneity: the intermediate phase Fe2+F2 is already being further lithiated to produce LiF and Fe on the outside despite the presence of unreacted FeF3 at the interior of the active particle. After all FeF3 is consumed, the magnitude of the voltage relaxation in the MW and the NW electrode becomes comparable. Similar analysis based on reaction homogeneity can be made for the charging process. Figure 4d shows the remaining voltage difference at the same state of lithiation between charge and discharge steps after the 4 h relaxation (Vgap) for both the MW and NW electrodes. Vgap can become slightly smaller based on its changing trend if the relaxation time is further increased. However, it did not become zero after 24 h relaxation in a separate experiment.

DISCUSSION Proposed Origins of voltage hysteresis in FeF3 conversion electrodes By integrating all experimental and theoretical simulation results, we can identify the following components from the GITT that contribute to the voltage hysteresis observed at non- zero current (see Figure 4b). The first one is the iR voltage drop, which is the sudden voltage jump after the current is removed and typically < 100 mV in our measurements. The second component is the reaction overpotential () that is required to nucleate and grow new phases, drive mass transport, and overcome the interfacial penalty for making nanophases. This overpotential is manifested in the voltage plummet when the current is applied and the spike when the current is removed. However, its magnitude is not straightforward to quantify using the GITT results, because the active particles undergo phase transformations and cannot achieve a truly homogeneous composition over the entire particle simply through Li+ diffusion during the relaxation. Reverse-step potentiostatic intermittent titration technique (PITT) may be a more suitable approach to provide the quantitative evaluation, according to which the overpotential is 300 mV for the conversion reaction (reduction of intermediate product FeF2 to LiF/Fe, measured at xLi = 1.2 per FeF3) and 70 mV for reconversion reaction (LiF/Fe to FeF2, measured at xLi = 1.2 per FeF3).20", "page": 20, "position": 0}

For example, we can infer from the in situ TEM and XAS results that at states of lithiation close to xLi = 3 per FeF3, during discharge the intermediate phase FeF2 is located at the interior of the active particles while Fe/LiF are on the outside and have contact with the electrolyte and current collector (see schematic illustration in Figure 4a inset, left); in contrast, during charge the intermediate phase FeF2 should first formed on the outside while Fe is located inside and may be screened or even isolated from the electrochemical system by the electrically and ionically insulating FeF2 phase (Figure 4a inset, right). The correlation between phase distribution in an active particle and voltage hysteresis can be better seen in the schematic illustration in Figure 5. Even though the system is at the same state of lithiation, a FeF2-rich (Li-poor) surface (during charge) and a Fe/LiF (Li-rich) surface (during discharge) will set the system at different potentials versus the Li+/Li potential, which introduces a voltage gap (similar to concentration overpotential). This hysteresis caused by compositional inhomogeneity cannot be fully eliminated by voltage relaxation (zero-current) because it is very difficult, if not impossible, to make the relevant phases (or Li+ distribution), such as FeF2 (“Li- poor” phase) and Fe/LiF (“Li-rich” phase) at the states of lithiation close to xLi = 3 per FeF3, become spatially homogeneous simply by Li+ diffusion. Such relaxation process also requires the migration of F and Fe2+ ions, which typically move very slowly. The situation is different from that of intercalation electrode materials (such as LiCoO2 and graphite), in which during relaxation the Li+ distribution can become homogenous more easily because there is no need for other ions or atoms to migrate.

When Fe3+ is formed during charge and thus more significant inhomogeneity is introduced, the hysteresis gets significantly larger for both the NW (> 550 mV, xLi = 0.63) and the MW electrode (>700 mV, at xLi = 1.26 and 1.05). Now it is easier to understand why ~1 V voltage gap was observed even when the phases present are the same. For example, at states of lithiation xLi = ~1.8 (approximately the middle point in Figure 5), if we add the hysteresis caused by compositional inhomogeneity (~400 mV according to Figure 4d) to the hysteresis caused by reaction overpotential (300 mV during discharge + 70 mV during recharge = 370 mV according to ref. 20) and IR drop (~100 mV combined discharge and charge according to Figure 4a), we can expect a voltage gap ~1 V, which is consistent with what we observed during the galvanostatic discharge and charge experiments (Figure 5).

The voltage profile is collected from an FeF3 NW electrode cycled at 1/10 C rate. The FeF3 domain size is ~1020 nm according to the TEM characterization. This newly proposed compositional-inhomogeneity mechanism for driving hysteresis likely plays a role in many kinetically limited conversion materials where during Li insertion (extraction) the most reduced (oxidized) phases are present at the active surface and drive the potential down (up) compared the theoretical OCV. Interesting comparisons may also be made with Li-S and Li-O2 batteries during discharging/charging: after voltage relaxation, a voltage gap remains in the Li-S system possibly due to presence of different Li2Sn (n = 8, 6, 4, 2, and 1) phases,38 but approaches zero in the Li-oxygen system because there is only Li2O2. 39 These new understandings suggest strategies to minimize the voltage hysteresis, which is important for improving the battery energy efficiency. One straightforward approach is constructing a composite electrode consisting of nanostructured active particles whose size must be comparable to the length scale of the conversion reaction (< 10 nm for FeF3) and directly connected to electrically conductive scaffolds. A promising example could be embedding active materials between graphene layers to make a graphite intercalation compound (GIC).40 This is expected to minimize the voltage hysteresis caused by compositional inhomogeneity as well as the iR drop. However, sufficient amount of active materials needs to be embedded so that the overall volumetric energy density is not severely compromised. Another approach that deserves further exploration is incorporating another cation or anion into the lattice (similar to the function of a “catalyst”) to create a more disordered microstructure and improve ionic and electrical transport properties so that the reaction overpotential can be reduced. It is proposed that this approach can achieve higher energy density than the first one because no additional inactive", "page": 23, "position": 0}

As an example, the ternary fluoride CuyFe1yF2 solid-solution exhibits smaller hysteresis than pure FeF2 electrode41. One major challenge is to preserve the beneficial effect in repeated cycling, as Cu is rapidly lost through Cu+ dissolution into the liquid electrolyte.41, 42 CONCLUSION In summary, we elucidate the electrochemical reaction mechanism of the FeF3 (and FeF2) conversion electrode through integrated (in situ) experimental and theoretical studies. The phase evolution in the electrode is symmetrical during discharge and charge but the spatial distribution of the electrochemically active phases at the single-particle level, which is controlled by reaction kinetics, is very different. Such compositional inhomogeneity changes the way the active phases are connected to electrolyte (Li+) and current collector (electron) during discharge and charge, which consequently introduces a voltage gap. This, along with reaction overpotential and the iR voltage drop, leads to the large voltage hysteresis. This understanding is contrary to the popular belief that attributes the voltage hysteresis of the FeF3 electrode to asymmetric reaction pathways during discharge and charge. Further, since the issues that contribute to the hysteresis are kinetic in nature, it is hopeful that the voltage hysteresis can be reduced to a reasonable level (< 300 mV) by designing and optimizing material microstructure and electrode architecture. These results can help understand and minimize the voltage hysteresis in other conversion electrode materials, where compositional inhomogeneity was observed but not scrutinized,42-44 despite their asymmetrical reaction pathways controlled by reaction kinetics. This work brings new hope to the development of high energy-density LIBs based on conversion chemistry and provide insights to the hysteresis problems in other next-generation battery chemistries, such as Li-S and Li-O2.", "page": 24, "position": 0}
