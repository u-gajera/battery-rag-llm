More so, it is the interface between these materials, which is the nexus for their applicatory success. Herein, the interface strength variations between amorphous Si and Ti3C2Tx MXene are determined as the MXene surface functional groups (Tx) are changed using first principle calculations. Si is interfaced with three Ti3C2 MXene substrates having surface -OH, -OH and -O mixed, and -F functional groups. Density functional theory (DFT) results reveal that completely hydroxylated Ti3C2 has the highest interface strength of 0.6 J/m2 with amorphous Si. This interface strength value drops as the proportion of surface -O and -F groups increases. Additional analysis of electron redistribution and charge separation across the interface is provided for a complete understanding of underlying physico-chemical factors affecting the surface chemistry and resultant interface strength values. The presented comprehensive analysis of the interface aims to develop sophisticated MXene based electrodes by their targeted surface engineering.

To combat mechanical failures, additives are added to Si that acts as a mesh in the electrode architecture, providing Si enough space to expand and contract. Though initially polymers were used along with Si nanoparticles to create a breathable supportive mesh for long-lasting mechanical stability2-4, they lacked the most essentially required ionic and electronic conductivity besides being the cause of the electrode system’s added weight. Driven by the need to replace polymer additives with a conductive and flexible binder, 2D transition metal carbides/nitrides (MXenes), which were discovered by Gogotsi and coworkers in 20115 have been recently mixed with Si anode by diverse synthetic procedures6-10. MXenes are novel type of 2D structures that have gained the popular vote due to their high electronic conductivities, stability, hydrophilicity, and surface chemistry11-15. With these properties, and backed by their potential to have surface engineered by modulating the functional groups, MXenes promise excellent performance as electrodes and supercapacitors for Li and beyond batteries16-20. Experimental reports have shown that Si/MXene composite excels in performance over its parent Si anode in capacity retention and cycle stability7, 9, 10. Conductive MXene functions as more than a binder in the electrode system by providing additional diffusive pathways, enhancing electron transport, and acting as a current collector19, 21. Above all, it is the stability of Si and MXene’s interface, which is the foundation for the Si/MXenes system’s aforementioned efficacies. Si is previously known to suffer from mechanical strains during battery performance if interfaced firmly with a substrate (in generic sense additive, binder, or current collector)22. Therefore, interface adhesion of Si with substrate MXene needs to be critically tailored for optimum performance in batteries. MXenes have an added advantage of a vast library of materials (from which ~30 have been synthesized)11, and the option of modulating surface terminations (-OH, -O, and -F) by the choice of exfoliating agent during the synthesis process23. These surface terminations have a compelling role in altering the surface properties of an MXene24-26. With these revelations, the research community quickly predicted the impact of surface functional groups on MXene’s performance in LIB battery", "page": 1, "position": 0}

Recently, some extrinsic functional groups were successfully incorporated on MXenes to enlarge the interlayer spaces for enhanced charge-discharge kinetics and improved energy storage20, 28-30. All attempts were targeted to alleviate the role of MXenes as an electrode, with no attention being given to exploring characteristics of the functional group driven interface of MXenes with Si. As researchers advance towards utilizing surface terminations to influence electrode performance, there is a necessity to establish their impact on the interface adhesion strength between MXene and the bulk material such as Si. In recent years, adhesive interaction between electrode components has impacted the over-all electrode morphology, cycle life, and electronic performance22, 31. At present, most studies focus on the adhesion of a single atom20, 32, or at most small atom clusters such as of Li-S on the MXene surface33. First principle calculations have indicated a linear correlation between adsorption energies of single transition metal atoms on Ti3C2 (earliest reported MXene, which also remains the most studied due to its superior conductivity) and chemical attributes, such as charge distribution, bond length, and d-electron center of metal32. Interface adhesion analysis between a MXene and a 3D bulk go up to a recent experimentally measured value of 0.90 J/m2 between SiO2 and Ti3C2Tx34. The study reports variation in interface adhesion between the two materials as atomic thickness of MXene monolayer is changed. In their experimental work, Ti3C2Tx has higher adhesion with SiO2 ( 0.9 J/m2) which drops to 0.4 J/m2 for Ti2CTx. By far, no focus has been laid on the specificity of MXene surface functional groups (Tx) in all these reports. Thus, in the present study, we investigate the interface strength between 3D Si bulk and Ti3C2Tx MXene with differing surface functionalities by means of first principle calculations. Amorphous Si is interfaced with -OH, -OH/O mixed, and -F functionalized Ti3C2 MXene at near uniform interfacial distances.

Models and computational details Three Ti3C2Tx MXenes with different surface functional groups (Tx) were modeled prior to the interface analysis. Ti3C2Tx were derived from a stable and experimentally recognized atomic model of free-standing Ti3C2, where three Ti atomic layers are inter-cleaved with two C layers to result in five atomic thick Ti3C2 monolayer. Functional groups were attached to the surface under- coordinated Ti atoms, above the hollow site between three neighboring C atoms. Among all possible configurations of functional groups, this has been validated as thermodynamically most stable 35, 36. The three Ti3C2Tx configurations considered for the study are : (i) hydroxylated MXene Ti3C2(OH)2, where surface is saturated with -OH functional group; (ii) mixed functionalized MXene Ti3C2(OH/O)2 , where ~38% surface -OH groups are randomly replaced by -O; and (iii) fluorinated MXene Ti3C2F2, having -F as the only surface functional group. The three starting models were used for further analysis after complete optimization using density functional theory (DFT) within Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP)37. The top view of three MXene configurations can be seen in figure 1(a1-c1). Investigation of interface strength required surface energies of three MXene models, amorphous Si (a-Si) bulk, and the interface energy of a-Si/Ti3C2Tx systems. Amorphous Si bulk having 64 Si atoms has been derived from a crystalline Si64 (Diamond FCC) using the computational quenching process in accordance with our previous work22. Slabs of three MXenes and optimized a-Si were subjected to DFT relaxation with added an vacuum of 20 Å to calculate of surface energies. It was critical for a-Si’s free surface in the vacuum slab model to have the same surface area as its substrate MXene. Since the surface area of three Ti3C2 MXene models differs slightly due to different surface functionalization, we used three different vacuum models for a-Si surface energy calculation, each corresponding to individual MXene configuration. For the interface models, three optimized MXenes were individually interfaced (as depicted in figure 1) with a relaxed structure of a-Si bulk at an initial interfacial gap (d) of ~2.3Å.

All optimizations were done using DFT within the VASP package37. Projector-augmented- wave (PAW) potentials were used to mimic the inert core electrons and valence electrons were represented by plane-wave basis set with the energy cutoff of 650 eV39, 40.

In most experimental synthesis, the MXene surface comprises of a mix of -OH, -O and -F groups. Still, surface functional groups can be carefully tailored by optimizing HF concentration and drying temperature during synthesis procedures. These devised surface groups can drastically change MXenes surface properties and interfere in interface attributes. Thus, in the following sections, we discuss the influence of changing functional groups on the strength of the interface between Ti3C2 MXenes and a-Si. 3.1 Interface strength In order to obtain the interface strength of functionalized Ti3C2Tx MXenes with Si, we created vacuum slab models for all three interface systems, as represented in figure 2a. Here, slab 1 consists of a-Si, slab 2 consists of functionalized Ti3C2Tx MXene, and slab 3 have interface system of a-Si over the respective MXene. These structures are periodic in x-y dimensions with a vacuum of 20 Å in z dimension. Final energy outputs from the DFT simulations of slab models are listed in Table 1 and were used to calculate work of separation (Wsep). Wsep is the energy required to completely separate the two materials at the interface, in a direction normal to the surface. The standard definition of Wsep is: Wsep = s1 + s2 - g12 = 𝐄𝟏\"𝐄𝟐#𝐄𝟏𝟐 𝑨 (1) Here, s1, s2 are the surface energy of both materials in the system and g12 is the interface energy47. These are determined from total energies of slab 1, slab 2 and slab 3 as E1, E2 and E12 , respectively. A is the area of contact at the interface (surface area in x-y plane). Table 1 summarizes the slab energies E1, E2, E12 and surface area A for all the three interface systems post optimization. The calculation of surface area for the individual systems is detailed in Supporting Information.

The interface strength of a-Si/Ti3C2(OH)2 is calculated to be 0.606 J/m2 in Wsep calculations. This presently derived interface strength is comparable in magnitude to the recent experimental results of SiO2/Ti3C2Tx (0.9 J/m2) and SiO2/Ti2CTx (0.4 J/m2) interfaces34. However, surface chemistry’s role on adhesion interactions at the interface becomes more prominent as variation in the interface strength is seen even with the slightest change of surface functional groups on MXenes. The value of Wsep dropped to 0.142 J/m2 as fewer -OH groups are replaced by -O in the second interface system. Only 38% variation of the surface functional group (-OH to -O) significantly weakened the interface. With complete surface fluorination of Ti3C2, Wsep value further dropped to 0.115 J/m2. The interface strength of a-Si with Ti3C2Tx MXenes is below 0.6 J/m2, alike the interface strength results presented by Basu et al.22 between a-Si and graphene (0.41 J/m2) using the same methodology. This justifies why MXenes are increasingly being used along with Si in the battery systems. Interface adhesion of similar magnitude between active electrode particle and substrate benefits cycle life of a battery by mitigating stresses during lithiation/delithiation associated volume changes22. MXenes have proven to act as a promising substrate for active electrode particles such as Si, by effectively accommodating volume expansions and imparting system with flexibility for the generation of flexible stable electronics7, 10. Low interface strength between the system components is desired for liberal twisting and bending of MXenes, and prevent brittle failures associated with strong interfacial bonding.", "page": 7, "position": 0}

Studies on the interface properties of 2D materials with 3D bulk are still in their infancy. Thus quantitative determination of threshold value of interface adhesion for the continued electronic contact will require more detailed analysis with application-specific experimental validation. Since this lies beyond this study’s purpose, we assume the negative values for Wsep will be universally derogatory for all the interface systems. Thermodynamically, interface strength is sensitive to the energy of interface system E12. In equation 1, Wsep depends on the difference between E12 and the sum of energies of the individual materials (E1 + E2). If E12 is lower than E1 + E2, both materials can come together to form a stable interface with a positive Wsep, as is the case for the three interface systems presented in Table 1. In contrast, the high system energy of the interface E12 indicates either lack of chemical interaction or the presence of interfacial strains due to local charge redistribution. Both these conditions are the ancillary outcome of interfacial gap d. If d between the two materials is too high, there is a possibility of a lack of chemical interaction. Conversely, if d is too low, atoms in the interface might be strained due to lattice misfit or stearic repulsions caused by the concentration of charges. Several earlier works on 2D material such as graphene48, 49 throw light on the interface strength variation with the interfacial gap d.

AIMD simulation is a rigorous tool that provides insight into the system’s dynamics at a finite temperature by calculating forces for every frame from accurate electronic structure calculations. We employed relaxed structures of three different a-Si/ Ti3C2Tx interface systems (each having different MXene surface functionalization, initial d ~1.5 Å, and vacuum of 20 Å in z dimension) and observed the dynamics for 1000 AIMD steps. Snapshots of the starting three configurations are shown in the insets of figure 3. The two materials are very close ( d < 2 Å) in the start, which causes strain on the surface functional groups, as depicted by O-H bonds’ alignment in the snapshots. During the AIMD run, system energies E12 fluctuate as the interfacial gap d is altered due to movement of loosely bound interfacial Si atoms. These changes occurred during different time frames for the three interface systems. Since our primary focus lay in observing the correlation between the interfacial gap and the system’s stability, we plot only the system energy E12 for the individual interfaces corresponding to the d at that specific time frame in figure 3. The three plots clearly demonstrate a drop in the system energy E12 with an initial increase in interfacial gap d, followed by a rise of E12 as d further increases. The trend is clearly in accordance with the previous graphene-based works48 and indicates the formation of a potential well between 2 - 2.5 Å interfacial gap for all three interface systems. This drop of energy E12 indicates stability and agrees with our assumption that the distance of 2 - 2.5 Å between the current material surfaces should facilitate interface formation. While the value of d for potential wells in figure 3 are not absolute, they represent a close range where system stability could be achieved.

Another important observation that can be made from the presented plot is regarding the system energy at d < 2Å. Upon comparing the three interface systems, the system energy at d < 2Å was very high for completely hydroxylated and fluorinated MXene interfaces (as demonstrated in figures 3a and 3c).

H and F atoms on the surface of hydroxylated and fluorinated MXenes are well-coordinated and not free to form covalent bonds with Si atoms. Thus, close vicinity of Si surface causes strain on H-O, O-Ti, and F-Ti bonds, resulting in very high system energies. On the other hand, in second interface system, very close proximity of Si surface does cause certain strain to H-O bonds, but some loosely bound Si atoms diffuse closer to the surface to form Si-O bonds with the surface -O groups. The analyses presented here reveals the dependence of interface strength on the interfacial gap d in a-Si and Ti3C2Tx MXene systems through system energy E12. The existence of strains, chemisorption or physisorption at the interface are closely associated with interfacial gap d.

Here, we throw more light on the electron redistribution at a-Si/ Ti3C2Tx interfaces as the functional groups on MXenes are varied. For this, Bader charge analysis is performed on the optimized interface systems using scripts by Henkelman group50. Bader charge calculation scheme quantifies atomic charges based on the charge density in each atom’s bader volume in the system. Based on our used pseudopotential, Si atoms in the system have four valence electrons. Therefore, total electron transfer between the two materials (a-Si and Ti3C2Tx) is determined by summing electronic charges on all the Si atoms in the system. In all three interface systems, electrons were transferred from bulk a-Si to MXene (illustrated in figure 4 a-c) and are mentioned in Table 2 where the net charge transfer across the interface is quantified as Dq. The net electron exchange (Dq) at the interface is important for two reasons: first, it is symbolic of comparative ease of electronic interaction between the two surfaces; and second, it throws light on the existing bonding phenomenon. Charge transfer across the interface systems increases as functional groups (Tx) change from -OH to -F in MXenes (Table 2, i-iii). This quantitative evaluation could be explained by physico-chemical property of work function, which is the energy required to remove an electron from the surface. Yu et al.20 earlier reported the work function of the surface functionalized MXenes as follows: -OH terminated MXene has the lowest work function of 0.44 eV, while -O and -F terminated MXenes have high work functions (6.10 eV and 4.92 eV, respectively). Consequently, Ti3C2(OH)2 surface will have the lowest electron affinity, which will increase proportionately to the change in surface functional groups (-O and - F). Moreover, O and F atoms are highly electronegative (EN) in comparison to Si atoms (ENO = 3.44, ENF = 3.98, and ENSi = 1.90), and therefore, possess ability to withdraw more electrons from the latter.

Charge density in the interfacial region of a-Si and Ti3C2Tx MXenes is visualized by charge separation analysis and shown in figure 5 a1-c1. Charge separation scheme at the interface was extracted by subtracting charge density of individual materials from that of the entire system, and the difference is plotted with an isosurface of 0.0007 e Å-3. Accumulation and depletion of charges are depicted by red and green color in figure 5.

The sum electrons on the surface atoms of MXenes at the Si interface and the free surface are also summarized in Table 3. Loosely bounded Si atoms in a-Si bulk are distributed over MXene surfaces non-uniformly. While some surface Si atoms adsorb closely on the MXene surface, the majority are at a distance > 3Å, forming weak vdW interactions with the substrate. The charge separation scheme in figure 5 a1 indicates physisorption as the primary bonding mechanism in the system, which results in an intermittent amount of interface strength (0.60 J/m2). This is also favored by the lack of atomic strains on the interfacial", "page": 14, "position": 0}

Figure 5 a2,a3 presents electron distribution on the interfacial atoms at a-Si/ Ti3C2(OH)2 interface. Electron deprived H atoms can extract a small charge from a closely adsorbed Si atom (when d = 2.34 Å in figure 5 a2), in contrast to the high interfacial gap condition within the system when Si atom is present at the distance d > 3.2 Å from the MXene surface (figure 5 a3). In the latter condition, H and Si loose covalent contact and no electron exchange occurs between the two. We note in Table 3, the surface H atoms in the interfacial region have a slightly higher sum of total electrons (15.2054 e-1) than the H atoms present on the free surface with no intimate contact with Si (14.5529 e-1). Hence, charge depletion on H atoms directs very little electrons from the Si at the interface. Upon replacement of few -OH groups by -O on the surface of MXene, Si atoms are noted to move away from the surface -O groups and become more localized near -OH groups. Figure 5 b1 depicts the red isosurfaces on Si atoms closer to MXene, predominantly in the region with - OH groups. There is hardly any Si atom within the bonding range of surface -O groups. These two conditions are further detailed in figure 5b2-b3. The minimum distance between Si and surface O atoms in the current system is 3.2 Å, which is not positive for forming a covalent bond between Si and O. For the possibility of Si-O bond, bonding distance should be less than 1 Å as observed in section 3.2. Consequently, the surface -O groups tend to extract more electrons from Ti atoms to stabilize (figure 5 b3). As covalency between Ti-O increases, the ability of -O to bind with Si decreases resulting in a dip of interface strength between a-Si and Ti3C2(OH/O)2.

These values indicate Si atoms are partially chemisorbed on the MXene surface. Interestingly, enhanced interaction between a-Si/ Ti3C2F2 should indicate higher interface strength. However, due to close proximity of amorphous Si surface, there is a slight strain on F-Ti bonds due to stearic hindrance. When d > 3Å in the same interface system (figure 5 c3), the covalent communication between Si and F is negligent, and Ti atoms become the primary donors to F. Similar to -OH group, F takes ~ 1e-1 from Ti atoms. Overall, the surface of -F terminated MXene becomes saturated with charges. As a consequence of high concentration of charges in the interfacial region, stearic effects between the two materials reduce the interface strength. The interface strength of a-Si/Ti3C2F2 improved significantly when the interfacial gap d was expanded to 3.28Å. The vdW forces hold the resultant interface with no atomic strains and Wsep = 0.335 J/m2. The two a-Si/ Ti3C2F2 interface systems are compared in Supporting Information.", "page": 16, "position": 0}

The recognition of Schottky junction at the Ti3C2Tx / Si interface with its photodetector applications55 opened the door for their usage in solar cell applications. Lately, MXene - Si composite solar cells were reported to have enhanced efficiency of 11.5%56. Surface terminations inevitably impact the performance of MXene based solar cells due to variations in surface work function57. However, it will be crucial to take interface strength between MXene and Si into account while designing the system components. Till date, it is difficult to control the surface terminations during synthesis procedures, and most synthesized MXenes result in mixed terminations of -F/OH/O groups. Unlike in ion batteries where lower interface strength between MXene and Si is more suitable, the interface in solar cells is expected to be resistant to annealing. Thus high to intermittent interface strength is preferred for longevity and enhanced performance. 4. Conclusions", "page": 17, "position": 0}
{"chunk_id": "2009.12712v2_p18_c0", "doc_id": "2009.12712v2", "text": "19 To conclude, we have carried out DFT calculations to quantify the variation in interface strength between 3D amorphous Si bulk and surface terminated Ti3C2Tx MXenes. Our results show that - OH functionalized MXene binds most strongly to amorphous Si with work of separation of 0.606 J/m2 in comparison to -OH/O mixed and -F functionalized MXenes. These values of interface adhesion ranged from intermittent to low and are favorable for battery applications to permit easy expansion/contraction. AIMD simulations confirm that interfacial gap d between the two materials strongly influences the interface systems’ energetics and stability. Generally, a potential well is noted for the interface energy when d lies within 2Å and 2.5Å. But, in the case of surface fluorinated MXene, the potential well shifts slightly towards higher d. Next, the overall net electron exchange at the interface has little to say about the interface strength. The interface strength noted for the three interface systems is not linear to charge transferred across the interface as per the popular observation. Electron distribution across the interface is driven by physico-chemical surface properties such as work function and electronegativity of the functional groups. Detailed analyses of interfacial gap and bonding mechanism reveal that physisorbed interfaces have better interface strength as noted for a-Si/ Ti3C2(OH)2 and a-Si/ Ti3C2F2. The presence of a high concentration of charges in the interfacial region of partially chemisorbed materials resulted in steric effects. It was ultimately responsible for low interface strength as in the case of -F terminated Ti3C2Tx MXene and Si. Our results provide more in-depth insight into the atomic-level interfacial phenomena of surface terminated MXene with Si.
