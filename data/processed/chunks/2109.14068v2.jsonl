(Dated: 25 January 2022) Unraveling the atomistic and the electronic structure of solid-liquid interfaces is the key to the design of new materials for many important applications, from heterogeneous catalysis to battery technology. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations can in principle provide a reliable description of such interfaces, but the high computational costs severely restrict the accessible time and length scales. Here, we report machine learning-driven simulations of various interfaces between water and lithium manganese oxide (LixMn2O4), an important electrode material in lithium ion batteries and a catalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction. We employ a high-dimensional neural network potential (HDNNP) to compute the energies and forces several orders of magnitude faster than DFT without loss in accuracy. In addition, a high-dimensional neural network for spin prediction (HDNNS) is utilized to analyze the electronic structure of the manganese ions. Combining these methods, a series of interfaces is investigated by large-scale molecular dynamics. The simulations allow us to gain insights into a variety of properties like the dissociation of water molecules, proton transfer processes, and hydrogen bonds, as well as the geometric and electronic structure of the solid surfaces including the manganese oxidation state distribution, Jahn-Teller distortions, and electron hopping.

This control is particularly important for the OER, as the Mn oxidation states are considered to be central for this process.18 Apart from the overall composition of the material, the OER activity is also determined by the details of the solid-electrolyte in- terface whose geometric and electronic structure as well as the atomic composition can be substantially diﬀerent from the bulk.19,20 The active sites of electrocatalytic reactions are often embedded in a complex environment consisting of the – possibly reconstructed – solid surface and the electrical double layer. Small particles and porous materials have large surface-to-volume ratios, which are beneﬁcial for a high activity, but the exposed surfaces can exhibit very diﬀerent reactivities. The identiﬁcation of active sites is therefore essential in a bottom-up approach for the design of improved catalysts.21–25 A practical challenge when using LixMn2O4 as bat- tery material is capacity fading, which is related to the disproportionation", "page": 0, "position": 1}

For a correct representation at least the level of the generalized gradient approximation including an additional Hubbard-like term for on-site Coulomb in- teractions (GGA+U) or a hybrid functional containing a fraction of exact Hartree-Fock exchange is needed.37–41 A recent hybrid DFT benchmark of lithium manganese oxides showed that on-site Hartree-Fock exchange terms yield a correct description of partially ﬁlled shells of localized d electrons.41 However, up to now ab initio molecular dynamics simulations using GGA+U or hy- brid DFT functionals could only be performed for rather small LixMn2O4-water model systems containing a few hundred atoms on picosecond time scales due to the large computational eﬀort.42–46 To consider the interplay of a variety of diﬀerent structural motifs with a liquid solvent, picosecond time scales are not suﬃcient. For instance, for the equilibration of LixMn2O4-water interfaces including the formation of hydroxide layers, electrical double lay- ers, and/or strongly bound water at the interface as well as to obtain reliable statistics for elementary steps of pro- ton transfer (PT) reactions and hydrogen bond networks signiﬁcantly larger length and time scales are required. Machine learning potentials (MLP) combine the ef- ﬁciency of simple empirical potentials with the accu- racy of quantum mechanics allowing to meet these requirements.47–50 Consequently, various MLPs have been developed, e.g., for water51–54 and diﬀerent solid- liquid interface systems.55–58 In previous works we could further show that a high-dimensional neural network po- tential (HDNNP),59–63 a frequently used type of MLPs, is applicable to bulk materials containing transition metal ions in diﬀerent oxidation states64–66 and in diﬀerent magnetic orders.66 The ability to represent diﬀerent ox- idation states is mandatory for studying the LixMn2O4 system.

As the HDNNP’s underlying functional form is unbiased with respect to diﬀerent interaction types, an equally reliable description for the interactions in the bulk and at the interface is obtained as has been demonstrated, e.g., for the Cu-water67,68 and ZnO-water interfaces.69–71 Moreover, like most MLPs, HDNNPs are reactive, i.e., they are able to describe the formation and cleavage of bonds making them applicable to PT reac- tions omnipresent in electrochemical systems. Apart from the simulation of the atomistic struc- ture, machine learning algorithms can also be applied to obtain information about the electronic structure, for example, atomic charges,72–76 electrostatic multipole moments,77,78 polarizabilities,79 and even quantum me- chanical wavefunctions.80 Moreover, our recently devel- oped high-dimensional neural network spin (HDNNS) prediction method65 can be used to identify the oxida- tion and spin states of the Mn ions. This method is based on local geometric changes associated to the details of the electronic structure. Thus, in combination with an HDNNP providing the energies and forces, nowadays nanosecond time scale investigations of the geometric and electronic structure are possible for systems containing about 104-105 atoms. In this work we investigate the LixMn2O4-water in- terface employing an HDNNP in combination with an HDNNS. Several {100} and {110} surfaces with diﬀerent terminations in contact with water are investigated to un- ravel the spatial distribution of Mn oxidation states and oxygen species, such as oxide ions O2−, hydroxide ions OH−, neutral water molecules H2O, and hydronium ions H3O+.

The analysis of electron hopping rates between Mn ions, various PT reactions, and water species residence lifetimes under equilibrium conditions yields a detailed understanding of the kinetics and dynamics. Finally, we compare the activity of the diﬀerent surfaces and sites and show that initial steps of the OER occur already spontaneously under equilibrium conditions. II. METHODS In HDNNPs59,63, which we use to compute the energies and forces driving the molecular dynamics (MD) simu- lations, the potential energy is constructed as a sum of atomic energy contributions Eα n, E({R}) = Nelem X α=1 Nα atoms X n=1 Eα n .

The weight parameters {aρσ µν} and {bσ ν} of the atomic neural networks are optimized to accu- rately reproduce a training data set consisting of ener- gies Eref and atomic force components F ref of reference structures obtained, for example, in DFT calculations. For each element an individual atomic neural network is constructed making the neural network parameters element-speciﬁc. For clarity, the index α representing this element-dependence has been omitted in the quan- tities in Equation 2. The atomic neural networks are able to describe the complex relation between the atomic energies and the local chemical environments of the atoms. These envi- ronments are described by vectors of many-body atom- centered symmetry functions (ACSF)81 Gα n serving as structural ﬁngerprints of the local geometry inside a cut- oﬀsphere of radius Rc. ACSFs represent a general transformation from the Cartesian coordinates {R} to a translationally, rotationally, and permutationally in- variant structural description based on interatomic dis- tances and angles. Moreover, for all atoms of a given element, the ACSF vectors have the same dimensionality to ensure the applicability of the trained atomic neural networks to large-scale simulations of systems containing diﬀerent numbers of atoms. As the ACSFs depend only on the elements and positions of the atoms, HDNNPs are able to describe the making and breaking of bonds. The parameters deﬁning the spatial shapes of the radial and angular ACSFs can be adjusted to optimize the per- formance as described in the Supplementary Material. More detailed information about HDNNPs, ACSFs, their properties, and their construction are provided in several reviews.60–63 The HDNNS method65 is closely related to HDNNPs and employs the same atomic neural network topology. However, instead of atomic energy contributions Eα n, the atomic neural networks (Equation 2) yield the atomic spins Sα n, i.e., they provide the Sα n({R}) relation.

A HDNNS exploits the observation that diﬀerent oxidation states as well as high- and low-spin states of transition metal ions typically lead to structurally diﬀerent local environments. Thus, like for the energies and forces in HDNNPs, the method is based on the assumption that the atomic spins and oxidation states are uniquely de- ﬁned by the structure. Consequently, consistent refer- ence data corresponding to the ground state electronic structure are mandatory for a successful construction of the HDNNS. The absolute values of atomic reference spins obtained from DFT are used for training to cir- cumvent the issue that the electronic ground state is twofold degenerate with respect to the absolute sign of all spins. Since the present work is restricted to the magnetic ground state, we do not explicitly include the degrees of freedom related to the relative orientations of the atomic spins, but we note that magnetic HDNNPs taking these degrees of freedom into account have been proposed.66 Using both, an HDNNP and an HDNNS, in MD sim- ulations enables a simultaneous ﬁrst principles-quality representation of the geometric and the qualitative elec- tronic structure dynamics on nanosecond time scales for systems containing thousands of atoms.64–66 III.

Instead of total energies, the DFT formation energies were used for training, which were obtained from the to- tal energies minus the sum of the atomic energies cal- culated for the elements in their reference states, i.e., gaseous H2, body centered cubic Li, gaseous O2, and α- Mn. In addition to the formation energies also the DFT Cartesian atomic force components were used for train- ing the HDNNP.

High-dimensional neural networks The HDNNP and HDNNS are based on a ref- erence data set consisting of 15228 LixMn2O4 bulk structures,64,65 5143 water bulk structures, and 17597 LixMn2O4-water interface structures and their PBE0r- D3 DFT energies, atomic force components, and atomic spins.

A detailed description of the reference data set construction and composition is provided in the Supple- mentary Material. The PBE0r-D3 DFT formation energies range from −2.15 eV atom−1 to −0.83 eV atom−1 therefore spanning a ﬁtting interval of 1.32 eV atom−1. In Figures 2 (a) and (b) the three structure types can be identiﬁed by their formation energies between about −2.2 and −1.6, −1.6 and −1.3, as well as −1.0 and −0.8 eV atom−1 cor- responding to bulk LixMn2O4, interface structures, and bulk water, respectively.

The HDNNP reproduces the energies of the train- ing set with a root mean squared error (RMSE) of 1.9 meV atom−1, while it is able to predict the ener- gies of the test set with an RMSE of 2.4 meV atom−1. The RMSE of only the bulk water training structures is about 1.0 meV atom−1 (test set 1.1 meV atom−1) and thus about half of the values of the RMSEs of the LixMn2O4 and interface training structures, which are 2.0 and 2.1 meV atom−1, respectively (test sets 2.3 and 2.8 meV atom−1). We ascribe this diﬀerence to the less complex geometric and electronic structure of bulk liq- uid water that is typically very well represented by ma- chine learning potentials.51,54 We note that in spite of the increased complexity of the potential energy sur- face of the interface system, in particular the bulk LixMn2O4 test set RMSE is very similar to the RMSE of 2.2 meV atom−1 of a previous HDNNP ﬁtted to bulk LixMn2O4 data only.64 The maximum energy error of all data in the training/test set is 13.2/15.6 meV atom−1.

In our simulations we observe that in the outermost Mn2O4 layer on each side almost only MnIII ions are present (Figure 3 (a)).

Due to this lack of negative ions, the formation of MnIII ions is favored at the interface and MnIV ions are predominantly found in the second Mn2O4 layer (Figure 3 (a)). Deeper layers contain a decreasingly pronounced alternating excess of either MnIII or MnIV ions, respectively, which becomes small after several lay- ers. MnII ions are very rarely observed and, if found, they only emerge in the topmost layer with about 10−6 MnII ions per Mn site. In contrast to the {100}Li system, both sides of the slab representing the {100}Mn2O4 interface (Figure 1 (b)) are terminated by Mn2O4 resulting in total in 22 Li layers and 23 Mn2O4 layers. The reduced amount of Li+ ions in the {100}Mn2O4 system compared to the {100}Li system leads to a slight excess of MnIV ions instead of MnIII ions. In the topmost layer the fraction is about three MnIII to two MnIV ions (Figure 3 (b)). The increased stability of MnIV ions in the topmost layer compared to the {100}Li system can be explained by the coordination by OH−ions. For this system we ﬁnd that OH−ions are adsorbed on top of about 43% of the interface Mn ions. The majority of the corresponding protons formed in the dissociation of water molecules is attached to interface O2−ions, which are covered to about 21% forming OH−. This value is about half of the Mn coverage by OH− ions because there are twice as many interface O2−ions as Mn ions per layer. The OH−ions of the ﬁrst liquid layer are preferably but not exclusively located at MnIV sites while MnIII sites are typically coordinated by H2O molecules (Figure 4).

The second layer on each side adapts to the MnIV ex- cess in the system (Figure 3 (b)). The alternating excess of either MnIII or MnIV ions decays after a few layers converging to equal fractions of MnIII and MnIV ions in deeper layers. In contrast to the {100}Li system in which basically no MnII ions form, in the {100}Mn2O4 system we ﬁnd about 5 · 10−4 MnII ions per Mn site in the topmost Mn2O4 layer with some statistical ﬂuctuations depend- ing on the surface and simulation. Substantially longer simulations are expected to be required to obtain fully converged values for such small fractions. As both sides of the LixMn2O4 slab in every simulation are equal, con- verged results in Figure 3 are symmetric with respect to z = 0. Deviations from this behavior, which are small for most of our results, can consequently be employed to estimate the uncertainty caused by the ﬁnite simulation time. The {110}LiMnO2 (Figure 1 (c)) and {110}MnO2 (Figure 1 (d)) interface systems show similar amounts of about 3·10−4 and 4·10−4 MnII ions per Mn sites in the topmost surface layers. While the {110}LiMnO2 system contains a slight excess of MnIII over MnIV ions, the opposite is the case for the {110}MnO2 system. The topmost layer is still dominated by MnIII ions in both systems with a ratio of nine MnIII to one MnIV at the {110}LiMnO2 in- terface (Figure 3 (c)) and almost only MnIII ions at the {110}MnO2 interface (Figure 3 (d)). The reason for this preference of MnIII ions is the low coordination of the topmost Mn ions by only four O2−ions.

As a conse- quence, the second layer in the {110}LiMnO2 system and even the second and third layers in the {110}MnO2 in- terface are predominantly occupied by MnIV ions. The inﬂuence of the interface on the oxidation state distri- bution vanishes already after about four layers. Regular oscillations of the alternating excess of either MnIII or MnIV, respectively, can be observed in the bulk (Figure 3 (c) and (d)). As the amplitude of these oscillations varies for the {110}LiMnO2 and {110}MnO2 systems diﬀerent ar- rangements of MnIII and MnIV ions can lead to local min- imum conﬁgurations. Further, due to electron hopping processes, the MnIII and MnIV arrangements are dynami- cal at 298 K and diﬀerent local motifs are observed during the simulations even for the same interface systems. We note that the Mn oxidation state distribution is averaged over (001) planes in Figures 3 (a) and (b) and over (110) planes in Figures 3 (c) and (d) yielding diﬀerent slices of the structure. To compensate for the undercoordination of Mn ions by O2−, about 94% of the {110}LiMnO2 interface Mn ions are in addition coordinated by approximately two OH− ions. These OH−ions are placed on bridge sites thus re- sembling the octahedral coordination in bulk LixMn2O4 and are shared by two Mn ions (see Section IV C). About 46% of the interface O2−ions contain adsorbed H+ ions forming OH−. For the {110}MnO2 interface this value fur- ther increases slightly to about 48%, while there is about one adsorbed OH−ion per interfacial Mn atom. In this case, the OH−ions originating from the liquid phase are not placed at Mn bridge sites but adopt empty octahe- dral coordination sites (see section IV C).

To compare the OH−coverage between the {100}Mn2O4 interface and the {110}LiMnO2 and {110}MnO2 interfaces, the number of Mn ions per interface area has to be taken into account. This number is about 1.5 times higher at the {100}Mn2O4 interface compared to the other two interfaces. Still, the OH−coverage is higher at the {110}LiMnO2 and {110}MnO2 interfaces. Hence, the dissociation degree of H2O molecules is higher at these two interfaces, which provide more empty octahedral coordination sites of the interfacial Mn ions than the {100}Mn2O4 interface. In addition to the Mn oxidation state distribution, we estimated the charge transfer rates related to elec- tron hopping between the MnII, MnIII, and MnIV ions. These rates were determined from the number of oxi- dation state changes per time. Because two oxidation states are changed by one electron hop, this number is divided by two. The trajectory data was collected every 0.1 ps. The data in Figures 3 (a) to (d) show that even the fastest processes are more than an order of magni- tude slower than this sampling interval. This time scale diﬀerence ensures that the major fraction of processes is counted. To exclude counting of unsuccessful attempts to change the oxidation state, a transition is only consid- ered in case the spin value of a MnIV ion increases above 1.9 ¯h, the spin value of a MnIII ion increases above 2.3 ¯h or decreases below 1.7 ¯h, or the spin value of a MnII ion decreases below 2.1 ¯h. For all systems, the charge transfer rates are found to be largest close to the interface, with a maximum typi- cally in the second to fourth Mn containing layer (Figures 3 (a) to (d)).

These values are close to the value of 0.02 charge transfers per ps and Mn site obtained in our previous study of bulk LiMn2O4.65 The rates in the top- most layer of the {110}LiMnO2 interface are higher than those in the topmost layers of the other interfaces, and in general lower charge transfer rates are found in layers with predominant single Mn oxidation states. For the {110}LiMnO2 interface the rates are smaller in the sec- ond layer, which corresponds to the topmost layer at the {110}MnO2 interface. Therefore, the charge transfer rates in the LiMnO2 layers seem to be higher than those in the MnO2 layers. The electrons are not explicitly included in the HDNNP and the HDNNS identiﬁes diﬀerent oxidation states based on the local structural environment like, for example, the presence or absence of Jahn-Teller distor- tions. Consequently, the inhomogeneous distribution of MnIII and MnIV ions in the systems as well as the elec- tron hopping processes raise the question if the overall numbers of these ions are conserved during the simula- tions. In principle, in the solid phase there has to be a one-to-one ratio between the number of Li+ ions and the number of Mn eg electrons. Since the average num- ber of MnII ions contributing two eg electrons is rather small or even negligible at all interfaces, we expect to ﬁnd about the same number of Li+ ions and MnIII ions, each containing one eg electron, in the system. Indeed we observe that the number of eg electrons stays ap- proximately constant during all interface simulations (see Supplementary Material Figures S2 (a) to (d)). This ob- servation provides evidence of the conservation of total charge and number of electrons and conﬁrms the con- sistent description of the systems by the HDNNP.

Due to the slight excess of Li+ ions in the {100}Li sys- tem related to the surface geometry, there are more MnIII than MnIV ions present in this system. About 409 MnIII and 383 MnIV ions are predicted by the HDNNS on av- erage over the full simulation time of all three {100}Li interface simulations, which contain all the same number of Mn ions. Since 414 Li+ ions are present, the error in the number of eg electrons obtained from the HDNNS prediction is only about 1.2%. In contrast to the {100}Li system, the {100}Mn2O4 system contains more MnIV than MnIII ions. Also in this case the HDNNS prediction is very accurate yielding about 400 MnIII and 428 MnIV ions on average. Compared to the number of 396 Li+ ions, the prediction error in the number of eg electrons is again small (1.1%). For the {110}LiMnO2 system 401 eg electrons are predicted compared to 408 Li+ ions re- sulting in an underestimation of 1.8%. Again, the excess of MnIII over MnIV ions is predicted correctly (401:391). For the {110}MnO2 system, for which 386 MnIII and 406 MnIV ions are predicted by the HDNNS, an even better agreement with a deviation of only 0.4% is reached, as this slab contains 384 Li+ ions. In conclusion, the Mn oxidation states of all systems identiﬁed by the HDNNS are very accurately described via the geometric atomic environments of the Mn ions determined by the HDNNP energy surface.

The MnII ions in all systems have an above-average dis- tance from the solid and are slightly displaced towards the liquid, which can be reasoned by the larger size of MnII ions. The MnII ions are preferably coordinated by H2O instead of OH−of the water contact layer and the Mn-O distances are on average larger than for MnIII and MnIV ions. Dissolution of MnII ions was not observed in the 5 ns MD simulations at 298 K and 1 bar employ- ing atomically ﬂat solid surfaces without defects and in the absence of external electric ﬁelds. Therefore, disso- lution seems to be rare in equilibrium under standard conditions. Especially, the inclusion of steps and defects at the solid surface is expected to increase the dissolu- tion rate.96 Moreover, possible surface reconstructions as proposed for the {110} and {111} surfaces29,37,97,98 and the formation of surface layers of diﬀerent stoichiome- try such as Mn3O499–101 might also be relevant for MnII dissolution. In particular, the Mn3O4 tetragonal spinel structure, in which MnII ions substitute the Li+ ions at the tetrahedral sites of LixMn2O4, is an interesting can- didate for the formation of dissolved MnII ions. These MnII ions in addition block the Li+ channels in the spinel structure and thus need to be removed during charging of the battery. In summary, the weak interaction between water and the {100}Li interface seems to be responsible for only very little formation of MnII ions. The outermost Li+ layer separates the water molecules from the Mn and O2−ions, which are important for the dissociation of water and the formation of long-living OH−ions. A high coordination by O2−ions, i.e., a more bulk-like environment, favors the formation of higher Mn oxidation states and leads to a weaker interaction with water.

Structural characterization of the interfaces The atomic structure as well as the reactivity of the interface are determined by the termination of the solid surface.

Moreover, the structure and dynamics of the liquid in the vicinity of the interface and deviations of its properties from the bulk liquid are of high interest. To assess the impact of the interface on the properties of the liquid, the system has to be suﬃciently large to ensure the presence of a bulk-like region in the center of the liquid phase. This bulk-like region is not only impor- tant for comparing interfacial properties to those of the bulk, but also to obtain converged data for the interfa- cial properties. Figures 5 (a) to (d) show the averaged atomic distributions in all four systems. The central re- gion of the liquid phase is very similar for all diﬀerent sur- faces and shows only small ﬂuctuations, which are much larger in the vicinity of the surfaces. The density of H2O in the central 5 ˚A slice of the liquid phase is 0.946 kg l−1 (cH2O = 52.5 mol l−1). This density agrees very well with the value of 0.947 kg l−1 obtained in HDNNP-driven sim- ulations of bulk water. Further, the properties of the hydrogen bond network are very similar in the centers of the liquid in all simulations (Supplementary Mate- rial). Consequently, the simulation cells, which all have a water region with a diameter of at least 50 ˚A, are large enough to yield bulk properties in the center, which is in excellent agreement with previous studies on other solid- water interfaces.67,69 An underestimation of the density compared to the experimental value of 0.997 kg l−1 at 298 K and 1 bar102 is common in DFT calculations and was also observed in a previous study of water yielding 0.94 kg l−154 based on the revPBE0-D3103,104 DFT func- tional – we note that our results are based on the PBE0r- D382,105 DFT functional.

The concentration proﬁle as a function of the distance from the surfaces, which is proportional to the density proﬁle with the molar mass as proportionality constant, shows two distinct OH−peaks of about the same size for each phase boundary (Figure 5 (a) to (d)). These peaks correspond to protonated O2−ions of the solid and OH− ions adsorbed to Mn sites, respectively. Since these two peaks dominate the OH−concentration proﬁle and are of about equal height, essentially all protons and hydroxide ions formed in the dissociation of water molecules are bound at the solid surface. The OH−concentration is about three orders of magnitude smaller at the {100}Li interface compared to the other systems. The reason is that the OH−ions are not long-living at the {100}Li interface. Oscillations of the H2O concentration in the vicinity of the {100}Mn2O4 interface are more pronounced than in the vicinity of the {100}Li interface (Figure 5 (a) and (b)). The depletion layer beyond the ﬁrst water peak can be observed in the spatial atomic distributions in Figure 6 (b) as well. The relatively high concentration of H3O+ ions at the same distance as the second OH−peak will be discussed in Section IV D. The structural deviation of the contact layer from the bulk liquid for the {110}LiMnO2 and {110}MnO2 systems is even more pronounced. In the case of the {110}LiMnO2 system, the OH−concentration proﬁle shows the pres- ence of OH−ions rather far from the surface. The forma- tion of a small additional O2−peak on top of the surface with maximum concentrations between 1 and 10 mol l−1 is particularly interesting. This peak implies that some H2O molecules can be deprotonated twice to partially complete the octahedral coordination of the Mn ions as shown in Figure 7 (a).

Furthermore, a MnIV ion is often found close to a surface exposed O2−ion although the ﬁrst solid layer is typically dominated by MnIII ions at this surface. Thus, the surface exposed O2−ions have an impact on the distribution of MnIII and MnIV ions. At the {110}MnO2 interface an H2O concentration of 0.1 to 1 mol l−1 is found in the topmost layer of the solid surface, which implies the opposite process. Here, O2− ions are protonated twice thus forming water as shown in Figure 7 (b). A correlation of MnII formation to the formation of H2O molecules in the topmost solid layer is not observed. MnII ions are most often observed in environments in which the Mn ion is coordinated by two H2O molecules from above instead of typically one OH− ion and one H2O molecule. The double deprotonation and protonation processes can be viewed as surface re- constructions of the {110} LixMn2O4 surfaces.

Con- sequently, the H2O molecules at the {100}Li interface are more mobile than the various water species at the other interfaces, corresponding to the weaker interaction be- tween water and the {100}Li surface discussed above. As mentioned in Section IV B OH−ions are formed at the {100}Mn2O4, {110}LiMnO2, and {110}MnO2 inter- faces and cover the solid surface to a large fraction (Fig- ures 6 (b) to (d)). These OH−ions are rather strongly bound to speciﬁc sites and thus less mobile than the water molecules. Moreover, they are able to form strong hydro- gen bonds and can order the water molecules.

These OH−ions are rather strongly bound to speciﬁc sites and thus less mobile than the water molecules. Moreover, they are able to form strong hydro- gen bonds and can order the water molecules. Therefore, they have a large impact on the formation of the strongly bound water layer. The H2O/OH−distribution in the ﬁrst layer of the liquid phase does not follow a regular pattern at the {100}Mn2O4 interface (Figure 6 (b) as well as Figure 4). Hence, the MnIII/MnIV distribution in the ﬁrst layer of the solid phase is also disordered (Figure 4). The order in the H2O/OH−distribution increases for the {110}LiMnO2 and {110}MnO2 interfaces. At the {110}LiMnO2 interface most OH−ions of the ﬁrst layer of the liquid bridge the Mn sites, which are arranged in rows in the ﬁrst solid layer (e.g., y ≈5 ˚A in Figure 6 (c) as well as Figures 7 (a) and 8 (a)). Most H2O molecules in the ﬁrst layer are aligned in rows close to the Li+ ions with H atoms pointing to O2−ions of the solid (e.g., y ≈1 ˚A in Figure 6 (c)). In the ﬁrst layer of the solid rows of alternating O2−and OH−ions are formed (e.g., y ≈−1 ˚A in Figure 6 (c)). O2−excess can lead to MnIV ions in the topmost solid layer. In the ﬁrst solid layer of the {110}MnO2 interface an alternating pattern of O2−and OH−rows is formed, whereby O2−ions bridge the underlying Mn sites and the OH−ions are above the Li sites (e.g., y ≈3 ˚A and y ≈7 ˚A in Figure 6 (d) as well as Figures 7 (b) and 8 (b)). In some simulations the H2O molecules and OH− ions in the ﬁrst liquid layer are arranged in alternating rows (e.g., x ≈2 to 3 ˚A and x ≈5 to 6 ˚A in Figure 6 (d)). The oxygen atoms of the water species in the ﬁrst liquid layer generally tend to continue the oxygen face centered cubic (fcc) lattice of the solid yielding an ener- getically favored coordination", "page": 10, "position": 1}

The oxygen atoms of OH−ions and H2O molecules in the contact layer of the liquid prefer to be at sites which complete a bulk-like octahedral coordination of Mn or tetrahedral coordination of Li. The respective OH−ions thereby favor to bind to interfacial Mn ions. Therefore, strongly bound water structures form at the interface. To compare the residence lifetimes of the O atoms in the strongly bound water layers at the diﬀerent inter- faces as well as in the bulk quantitatively, the correlation function, Cres(t) = 1 Ntot −N(t) ttot−t X t0=0 rinit(t0) · r(t0 + t) |rinit(t0)| , (3) can be used with the total number of simulation steps Ntot and total simulation time ttot.

O atoms which are close to the boundary at the time t0 can lead to a large impact of short-term boundary crossing. To reduce this eﬀect, the vector rinit can employ a slightly smaller in- terval [zmin, zmax] than used for r.

Since the {100}Li interface has only a very thin strongly bound layer of H2O molecules, the residence lifetime of about 14 ns is still similar to bulk water, which is expected due to the weak interaction of this surface with the liq- uid. However, the {100}Mn2O4 and {110}LiMnO2 inter- faces containing large amounts of OH−ions bind the hy- droxide/strongly bound water layer leading to higher res- idence lifetimes of about 37 and 31 ns, respectively. For the {110}MnO2 interface only very few oxygen species in the strongly bound layer can escape from the in- terface during the 5 ns simulation. We note that the relative comparison of these numbers is more valuable than the absolute numbers because the underlying DFT method may generally tend to under- or overstructure water leading to faster or slower diﬀusion than obtained experimentally.108–110 D. Proton transfer An atomistic understanding of site-speciﬁc reaction mechanisms is crucial in the bottom-up development of advanced heterogeneous catalysts. The reactivity of solid surfaces can be highly dependent on the inter- face structure. The identiﬁcation of active solid surface sites can therefore target the design of particle shapes and sizes yielding a higher activity. For instance, we have seen that the dissociation of water molecules is much more frequent at the {100}Mn2O4, {110}LiMnO2, and {110}MnO2 interfaces compared to the {100}Li inter- face. Since the initial steps of the proposed OER mech- anism at LixMn2O4 include the formation of two OH− ions on top of [MnIII 2 MnIV 2 O4]6+,10 PT reactions at the interface are likely to play an important role. The PT reaction rates in Figures 10 (a) to (d) are obtained from changes in the H atom assignments to the closest O atom, i.e., it is the number of assignment changes per unit time. The projected networks of the PT reactions near the interfaces are shown in Figures 11 (a) to (d).

In the ideal case, all PT processes from one local minimum conﬁguration to another one are counted, while proton rattling events, in which H atoms quickly jump back and forth between O atoms without settling on one of them, are excluded. However, an unambiguous dis- tinction of both types is not possible. We decided to use a sampling interval of 0.1 ps to reduce counting of proton rattling events because in this time interval a new local minimum can often be adopted. This approach yields a lower boundary of the absolute reaction rates since some PTs can be missed if forward and backward reactions happen rapidly. Also, nuclear quantum eﬀects, which are not included in our simulations, are expected to increase the PT reaction rates.111 In the Supplementary Material we calculate the PT reaction rates of shorter trajectories using a reduced sampling interval of 1 fs, while requir- ing that the assignment of the H atom to the closest O atom has to be maintained for 50 fs after a transition to be counted as PT reaction. This approach yields mostly similar reaction rates of the frequent processes, while rare processes are sampled worse due to the shorter total sim- ulation time (Supplementary Material Figures S10 (a) to (d)). Since the same approximations have been applied in the analysis of all PT processes, errors are expected to cancel to some extent resulting in comparable relative reaction rates.

Since the PT rates of forward and backward reactions are equal in equilib- rium according to the principle of detailed balance, their average has been calculated. At the {100}Li interface the dominant PT mechanism is the hydroxylation of the solid surface (Figure 10 (a)), which has been called “surface PT” in earlier work.69–71 An O2−ion from the solid accepts one proton from an H2O molecule such that two OH−ions are formed (Fig- ure 12 (a)). The backward reactions most often happen between the same atoms (Figure 11 (a)) since the OH− ions are not long-living at the {100}Li interface. PTs be- tween H2O molecules and OH−ions in the ﬁrst liquid layer, i.e., “adlayer PT”,69 happen rarely. Due to the ef- fectively zero-dimensional proton transport by these PT reactions, the long-range transport is only given by dif- fusion and not by PT reactions following a Grotthus- like mechanism. In the liquid phase we can observe rare events of the autoionization of water, i.e., the formation of OH−and H3O+ ions from two H2O molecules (very small green peaks between −15 ˚A < z < 15 ˚A in Fig- ure 10 (a)). These PT processes in the bulk can also be observed in some of the other simulations which are not shown in Figure 10. The OH−and H3O+ ions al- ways recombine very quickly. This behavior is expected as a pH value of 7 in bulk water would mean that only a concentration of 10−7 mol l−1 H3O+ ions are present. Consequently, there would be around 0.1 H3O+ ions in one of the 5 · 104 structures of a simulation trajectory including about 103 H2O molecules each.

The H3O+ ion can be seen as transition state of the PT which rapidly transfers an- other proton to an O2−ion of the surface (Figure 12 (b)). Such solvent-assisted PTs have also been observed at ZnO-water surfaces in previous work.70 Surface PTs (vio- let) can be observed at the same locations as the solvent- assisted PTs (blue) in Figure 11 (b). Hence, the hy- droxylation is in dynamic equilibrium at the {100}Mn2O4 interface. The diﬀerence to the {100}Li interface is that the equilibrium of surface PT reactions is shifted towards the occurrence of OH−ions at the {100}Mn2O4 interface.

As for the {100} interfaces, surface PTs are a large fraction of the PT reactions at the {110}LiMnO2 interface (Figure 10 (c)). The dominant PT reaction, where the proton of an H2O molecule is transferred to the O2−ion of the ﬁrst solid layer, can be followed by a PT from an OH−ion of the ﬁrst solid layer to the just created OH− ion (Figure 12 (d)). The OH−ion in the ﬁrst liquid layer is therefore an intermediate species in this two-step transfer (violet zigzag lines in Figure 11 (c)). In contrast to the other interfaces, OH−ions in the ﬁrst liquid layer can also transfer their proton to another OH−ion form- ing surface exposed O2−ions at the {110}LiMnO2 solid surface, i.e., H2O molecules are deprotonated twice (sec- ond closest violet peak to the interface in Figure 10 (c) and vertical violet lines in Figure 11 (c)). In addition, adlayer PTs can happen as well yielding in total a two- dimensional PT network. At the {110}MnO2 interface PTs between H2O molecules and OH−ions are dominant (Figure 10 (d)).

Many diﬀer- ent processes can happen which can be very speciﬁc to the interface structure. Larger interface areas in princi- ple increase the PT reaction rates, but some reactions, as observed, e.g., for solvent-assisted PTs and the forma- tion of surface exposed O2−ions, only happen at partic- ular sites. Only an increase of these surface sites would lead to a higher activity highlighting the importance of the site-speciﬁc atomistic understanding. The reaction mechanisms at the diﬀerent interfaces determine how fast long-range transport of reactive species by PT reactions can be.

The solid phase is highlighted by a gray background. the case of the {100}Mn2O4 system, i.e., the diﬀerence be- tween the red graph in Figure 13 (c) and the blue graph in Figure 13 (a), shows that the OH−ion in the bulk un- dergoes more than one PT per picosecond. In the liquid layer closest to the interface the rate is below one per pi- cosecond. Liquid layers further away from the interface can also reach as high reaction rates per particle as in the bulk liquid.

Thus, the high concentration of reactive species at the interface is the reason for the high PT re- action rates. The very speciﬁc reaction paths present at the interface cannot take place in the bulk. V. CONCLUSION A high-dimensional neural network potential has been used to perform ﬁrst principles-quality simulations of sev- eral LixMn2O4 spinel-water interfaces. These simula- tions reveal spontaneous water dissociation and the for- mation of a hydroxide layer at several solid surface cuts. The diﬀerent water species can arrange in strongly bound water layers with signiﬁcantly reduced mobility at the interface, whose structures are highly dependent on the underlying solid surface. The oxygen atoms of the diﬀer- ent water species in the ﬁrst liquid layer tend to mimic the bulk oxygen coordination of Li and Mn ions because these binding sites are preferred by the solid. A second strongly bound water layer is formed at interfaces with a large fraction of hydroxide ions. Its structure deviates from the face centered cubic lattice of bulk oxygen to optimize the interaction with the bulk liquid. A high-dimensional neural network for spin prediction allows to determine the inﬂuence of the solid-liquid in- terface on the Mn oxidation state distribution. Weak interaction with water seems to be an indicator for only little formation of MnII ions at the interface. An increas- ing number of coordinating oxide ions of interfacial Mn ions stabilizes higher Mn oxidation states. The mobility of eg electrons is increased in the vicinity of the inter- face compared to the bulk. Consequently, higher battery performance can be achieved with smaller particles sizes while smaller particles are also more prone to degradation since soluble MnII ions are formed at the interface. Proton transfer occurs between water molecules and oxide ions at the solid surface. The formed hydroxide ions originating from water molecules are stabilized in the", "page": 16, "position": 1}

Active sites at the interface increase the amount of water dissociation signiﬁcantly compared to the bulk liquid. Beyond the solid surface, the reactiv- ity is also highly dependent on the structure of the water contact layer because a large part of the proton transfer reactions takes place within this layer. The mobility of the water species at the interface is reduced. However, the protons can be transported by PT reactions depend- ing on the eﬀective dimensionality of the surface-speciﬁc proton transfer network. The number of possible paths as well as the underlying mechanisms are highly dependent on the interface structure. Therefore, a larger interface area increases the reactivity only if this interface includes the respective active sites. In summary, in the present work a ﬁrst step has been taken towards an understanding of site-speciﬁc reactions at the atomic scale to obtain control tactics for higher performance and durability of battery materials as well as higher reactivity of catalysts.
