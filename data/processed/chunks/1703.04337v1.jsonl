Little is known about the structural mechanism of Na/P cycling due to the fact that only one of the structures involved (Na3P) is crystalline. Using operando X-ray diffraction computed tomography (XRD-CT) analysed by Rietveld and pair distribution (PDF) methods combined with density functional theory (DFT) calculations we show that the sodiation and desodiation mechanisms of phosphorus are very different. Sodiation follows the thermodynamic path of lowest energy from P via NaP to Na3P while desodiation follows a kinetically controlled deintercalation mechanism in which the layered Na3-xP type structure is maintained until P nanoclusters form. Using XRD-CT allows analysis of the 3D structure of the anode, but most importantly, removes the contributions from the sample container and other battery components, particularly important for PDF analysis. Introduction If we could store the energy produced from renewable sources effectively then the demand for fossil fuel energy generation would be drastically reduced. Sodium ion batteries (SIBs) are one of the best technological hopes for stationary electrochemical energy storage, offering a cheap and chemically similar alternative to lithium ion batteries (LIBs). The key weakness in adapting LIB technology for SIBs is the anode material. Graphite is a highly effective anode for LIBs but has a poor capacity for Na: new materials are needed.

Among the possible solutions alloying anodes have proved one of the most promising, with high capacities based on the fact that each anode atom can fix multiple Na ions. Several metallic and semi-metallic elements have been tested as SIB anodes, but the highest capacity has been exhibited by red phosphorus (theoretical capacity 2596 mAh g-1 ). This system (reported almost simultaneously by two groups) furthermore shows a reversible capacity of up to 1890 mAh g-1 as a composite with carbon and considerable cycling stability with a capacity of around 1000 mAh g-1 retained after 140 charge/discharge cycles1-2.

They found that the phosphorene layer is transformed to an amorphous structure during the first cycle while still being confined between graphene layers. Xu et al reported a composite of black phosphorus, “Ketjenblack” carbon polymer and multi-walled carbon nanotubes and investigated the mechanism of sodiation and desodiation using ex situ NMR and TEM, revealing NaP as an amorphous intermediate phase5. Ramireddy and co-workers made a systematic study of the existing data on P/C composite anodes for LIBs and SIBs and added their own measurements including TEM6. The mechanisms of bismuth and antimony alloying anodes have recently been elucidated using combinations of X-ray diffraction, total X-ray scattering, spectroscopy and calculations7-8. The mechanism of phosphorus anodes, however, remains a subject of debate- in large part due to the fact that of all the possible phases present during battery cycling, only Na3P is observed in crystalline form. The study on Sb anodes by Allan and co-workers points the way here- using pair distribution function analysis of operando battery total scattering data they elucidate the different phases found during the transformation from Sb to Na3Sb and back again, including non-crystalline, non- stoichiometric intermediates7. Recently some of the same authors also used calculation methods to determine the most stable phases expected during the cycling of phosphorus anodes in LIBs and SIBs9. One of the problems in studying battery structures in general and in particular when using total X-ray scattering methods is the contribution to the data from parts of the battery other than those in which we are interested. Allan et al7 and Chapman et al10-12 have addressed this by using background subtraction methods and adapting their batteries significantly for total scattering experiments.

Although operando tomographic imaging has recently revealed significant information on the macrostructure of batteries14-16, the technique has not previously been applied using atomic structural data. Jensen et al have studied commercial lithium ion and nickel metal hydride batteries using XRD-CT methods, mapping the distribution of LiCoO2 from the intensity of a single peak and obtaining information on its orientation from the 2D diffraction patterns17, but not extracting actual structural data. By reconstructing the entire battery system from Rietveld and PDF analysis of XRD-CT data we have, firstly, removed all contributions from the sample container, electrolyte etc. and secondly, obtained three dimensional spatially resolved atomic structural data on a working phosphorus anode- revealing with full clarity the different mechanisms of sodiation and desodiation of phosphorus in good agreement with cycling data. The technique described here can easily be combined with traditional X-ray tomographic imaging (see ESI) to provide additional information on the battery macrostructure.

Drying of the electrodes was carried out at 60 °C overnight. The electrodes were thereafter handled under inert atmosphere. The working electrode was separated from the Na metal disk as counter electrode by electrolyte soaked glass fibres (GF/C, Whatman). As electrolyte a 1 M solution of NaPF6 in ethylene carbonate/diethyl carbonate (EC/DEC, 1:1 in wt) solution with the addition of 5 wt % FEC was prepared. All electrolyte constituents were purchased from Sigma Aldrich. The battery was galvanostatically cycled in a voltage range of 0.01 V to 2 V vs Na/Na+ using a Biologic SP150 with low current option. The specific capacity values are expressed on the basis of the mass of phosphorus. Half cells were assembled in a specially constructed X-ray transparent electrochemical container for operando XRD/PDF-CT and absorption tomography measurements (see ESI). The sample container consists of a sealed Teflon cylinder containing two Al pistons on which working and Na metal counter electrode are directly deposited. The electrodes are separated by glass fibres soaked with electrolyte. The sample container is aligned such that the working electrode layer (containing about 0.1 mg of amorphous phosphorous and being about 30 μm thick) is oriented in plane with the X-ray beam and can be rotated by up to 360° around its vertical axis during the measurement.

The data collection took about 7 min per slice for XRD/PDF-CT, while each absorption tomography measurement took about 15 min. The sequence of measurements was repeated several times during the first desodiation and second sodiation of the Na/P half-cell, which lasted about 4 h. Corrections were applied for artefacts in the filtered back projection tomogram caused by the Teflon walls of the sample container. A three dimensional map of the battery absorption coefficient was measured by a conventional absorption micro-tomography scan. An XRD-CT scan of the empty sample container was then measured. The absorption caused by the sample on the Teflon signal of the empty sample container was calculated using the 3-D absorption map. The calculation was done using a ray tracing program which computes the absorption correction for the diffracted signal generated by each voxel as a function of the sample orientation, 2-theta angle and azimuthal angle. The absorption corrected Teflon signal was removed from the battery diffraction signal for each voxel. The corrected diffractograms were processed using PDFGETX320 to give radial pair distribution functions. Further details of the reconstruction and corrections are given in ESI section S2. Rietveld refinements were carried out using a “surface” strategy (i.e. treating all the diffractograms as a single 3D “surface“ of data with some parameters linked for the entire dataset but no use of parametric equations) based on the parametric Rietveld method in TOPAS V521-22.

Based on the observations from the Rietveld analysis that there was limited variation within the slices and only slices 2 and 3 were composed mainly of anode material, PDFs from the relevant voxels (i.e. those in which sample material was observed) were averaged for each of these slices. The scattering data were rebinned with a linearly increasing bin size in order to reduce the effects of statistical and systematic noise; this can be done without loss of information as the patterns vary smoothly and are devoid of sharp features at high Q. The step size was varied such that the final step at high Q was five times larger than the step at low Q. Background due to cell and sample container constituents was determined by using the residuals from the most featureless patterns (those containing only amorphous P), after subtraction of the electrode signal. The resulting background G(r) was then fitted to a spline in order to avoid biasing the subtraction to noise, and subtracted from the G(r) of all of the signals.

The final cluster models used are shown in Figure 1. The scale factors were refined for all phases and lattice parameters were refined for the Na3P, the only phase with significant long range order. A global bond length variation parameter was refined for the NaP and P clusters. In order to reduce the number of free parameters, thermal parameters for the Na and P were constrained to be constant during all fits and across all of the phases.

Circles indicate the voltage/capacity states for the measured XRD/PDF-CT slices. Each XRD/PDF tomogram comprises a set of 5 slices. The voltage profile of the Na/P half-cell during the experiment (first sodiation, desodiation and second sodiation) is shown in Figure 2. Note that the first sodiation of the cell, during which the irreversible formation of the solid electrolyte interface (SEI) occurs was not studied in the operando tomographic experiment. The desodiation profile has a single long plateau at about 0.6 V. During the second sodiation voltage plateaus are observed at about 0.3 and 0.2 V, as for the latter stages of the first sodiation. These features suggest different sodiation and desodiation mechanisms. Qian et al observed several voltage plateaus during desodiation for P/C composites, corresponding to well defined cyclic voltammetry (CV) peaks, which they attributed to a series of phases (Na3P - Na2P - NaP - NaP7) following the Na/P phase diagram32. It is possible that these extra desodiation plateaus were not observed by ourselves or other researchers due to the very low rate used by Qian et al for their CV measurement (0.02 mV/s ≈ C/30)1. They assume sodiation to follow the same path, although the voltage plateaus/CV peaks are less well defined. Kim et al2 present voltage profiles similar to ours (although their desodiation plateau slopes between around 0.4 and 0.6 V) as do Li et al3 and Ramireddy at al6. These authors do not speculate on the mechanisms beyond pointing out that the plateau at 0.2 V during sodiation corresponds to the formation of crystalline Na3P, observed in ex situ XRD patterns. The phosphorene/graphene sandwich anode reported by Sun et al shows a small plateau at ~0.7 V during desodiation in addition to the long 0.6 V plateau4. In fact this plateau is present to some degree in all Na/P cycling data but is often hard to see (note the slight change in slope at a capacity of around 1000 mAh g-1 in Figure 2).

Slices were collected a different distances from the current collector. Slice 1 is closest to the current collector and slices 4 and 5 partly cut into the glass fibre separator. Note that the variation within the slices is minimal. The c-axis variations between the slices are probably due in the most part to changes in the charge state during the 7 min acquisition time per slice. Initial analysis of the reconstructed data using “surface” Rietveld methods (with the crystalline Na3P structure) showed relatively small structural variations within the individual tomographic slices (Figure 3), but confirmed the stability of the methods and the location of the anode material at the sodiated stages of cycling. The results show clearly that slices 4 and 5 of the tomogram contain significant amounts of glass fibre separating material, with slice 5 containing virtually no anode material. Variations in the parameters between the layers are probably due principally to the changes in charge state during the 7 minute acquisition time per slice (see the charge state labels in Figure 3). The central section of slice 4, however, does seem to have a well determined Na3P c-axis parameter which is similar to that of slice 1 (close to the current collector). This may indicate that the reaction is at a different stage at the outer slices of the anode, close to the electrolyte and current collector, than in the central slices of the anode. Note however that the sodiation is complete at slice 4, with the final capacity of 1471 mAhg-1 reached, while in slices 1, 2 and 3 sodiation is still in progress. This is supported by comparing the reconstructed diffractograms from the centre of the layers (ESI, figure S17), which appear to be of similar quality for slices 2, 3 and 4. It is possible that the beam size used (16x200m2) in this experiment relative to the small crystallite sizes (see below) results in some averaging of the structures- it may be feasible", "page": 5, "position": 0}

Lattice parameter and site occupancy results from diffractograms collected at charge states where crystalline Na3P is not present are omitted. Rietveld analysis of the voxel at position (15,15) in tomographic slices 2 and 3 showed the appearance of the highly crystalline Na3P phase during sodiation and its disappearance during desodiation, best observed from the Lorentzian crystallite size broadening parameter. Trends in the crystallite size, unit cell axes and occupancy of the Na atom sites of the layered Na3P structure are shown in Figure 5 along with the voltage profiles for comparison. A clear decline in crystallite size is observed during desodiation with a corresponding growth in the crystallite size during sodiation at the point where the phase begins to appear. Crystallite sizes in nm were obtained with the double- Voigt approach using the LVol-IB method from a fundamental parameters peak shape in TOPAS version 5. (Note that although the Lorentzian crystallite size macro was used in the TOPAS input files to model the peak broadening, although it is quite possible that the true source of broadening is strain). We were not able to fully characterise the setup for fundamental parameters crystallite size determination, and the size values from the Rietveld analysis are therefore not absolute; the trends however are real. The two Na sites are seen to depopulate during desodiation and gradually repopulate as the Na3P phase reappears during sodiation. This suggests high mobility of Na in the phase, in agreement with the findings of Qian et al1. Similar high Na mobility was observed by Allan et al in Na3Sb7. In addition we see that the occupancies of the Na sites never reach 100%, suggesting that fully stoichiometric Na3P is not formed.

The Lorentzian crystallite size (used to indicate the presence of crystalline Na3P as the Rietveld scale factor is highly influenced by increases in the peak width when there are no longer clear Bragg peaks in the patterns and therefore fails to clearly indicate the appearance and disappearance of the crystalline phase) from the Rietveld refinement is plotted on the same axes to allow comparison between the PDF and Rietveld analysis for Na3P. The G(r) when fully desodiated has only one peak at approx. 2.25 Å (the approximate length of a P-P bond) indicating a phosphorus cluster of just a few atoms with no order beyond the first shell of P-P bonds. We fitted this using a model cluster of just 4 P atoms (see Figure 1). The PDF analysis reveals that NaP is formed during sodiation but not during desodiation (meaning that our assignment of the broad peak at 2θ ≈ 4 ° in the powder diffraction patterns in Figure 4 to NaP is correct), while Na3P is present for longer during desodiation. The crystallite size of Na3P from the Rietveld refinements was used as an indicator of whether the phase was observed in the Bragg scattering. Compared to the Rietveld analysis of Na3P we observe the phase later during desodiation and earlier during sodiation in the PDF data, suggesting that amorphous Na3P exists in addition to the amorphous NaP and P phases.

DFT calculations were used to construct a convex energy hull for the Na/P system and this was found to be in agreement with that reported by Mayo et al.9 The hull suggests the most thermodynamically favourable route between P and Na3P.

These phases would ease the transition from very small P clusters to the layered structure of Na3P (see ESI). The recent NMR work of Xu et al also shows clear evidence of NaP as an intermediate structure5. The energy hull does not help us to understand why the thermodynamic route is not followed on desodiation. We therefore carried out further calculations on the deintercalation of Na from Na3P, maintaining the layered structure as observed in the operando tomographic experiment. We found that several stable phases exist, suggesting that a smooth transition from Na3P through Na3-xP to P should be favoured by kinetics over the nucleation of NaP. i.e. in the case of high Na mobility as suggested by Qian et al1 and our Rietveld refinements, NaP should not form. Na2.6P and Na2.36P are found to be the possible stable Na deficient structures in the Na3P matrix and are included as points in the energy diagram (the red dotted line indicates the kinetically favoured path from Na3P to P). Furthermore, we calculated that Na2P, which might serve as an intermediate on the path to NaP during desodiation, is highly unstable (this phase is also shown, well above the convex hull, in Figure 7). We believe that the small plateau observed at ~0.7 V during desodiation for phosphorene/graphene anodes4 is a sign that the thermodynamic mechanism (Na3P-NaP-P) co-exists with the kinetic deintercalation mechanism to some degree at lower rates of desodiation. A similar kinetic mechanism was observed during desodiation of the Na/Sb system by Allan and co-workers7. The reasons for the different mechanisms of sodiation and desodiation of the group 15 elements are still unclear, though size effects may be significant. P (0.44 Å) and Sb (0.90 Å) have sodiation routes different from those of their desodiation, which include significant amorphous components.

No experimental data on the Na/As system is available, although gallium arsenide has recently been studied as an anode for LIBs35. The rate of deintercalation of Na from the crystalline Na3P is probably too rapid for the formation of intermediates except at very low rates of desodiation1, 4. Na3Sb is similar, with the deintercalation leading to other clearly identifiable amorphous intermediates, but not NaSb7. The 23Na NMR results reported by Allan and co-workers show high Na mobility (which they relate to the excellent high rate performance of Sb anodes) in crystalline Na3Sb which supports the idea that fast Na deintercalation may be connected to the differences between sodiation and desodiation routes in P and Sb anodes7. The thermodynamic sodiation route from P nanoclusters to NaP chains to layered Na3P, involves the breaking and forming of many bonds and should be significantly slower than deintercalation. A similar scheme with kinetically and thermodynamically controlled routes for charge and discharge respectively is described by Kim and co-workers for the Na/Co3O4 battery system36. Conclusions By using a combination of operando XRD and PDF computed tomography on a working half-cell in tandem with DFT calculations, we have clearly revealed the different structural mechanisms of sodiation and desodiation of a phosphorus anode. Sodiation takes place via a thermodynamically favourable two-phase type mechanism with an amorphous, chain type NaP intermediate; while desodiation proceeds via rapid, kinetically controlled deintercalation of Na+ from Na3P, in which the crystalline layered structure of Na3P is preserved while amorphous P is formed until a significant", "page": 9, "position": 1}

It is likely that this occurs in (generally successful) competition with the reversal of the thermodynamically driven sodiation mechanism. The reaction path followed by the material is probably determined by the size of the alloying anode metal, the mobility of Na+ in the fully sodiated form (observed in the variation of Na occupancy during the operando experiment) and the stability of Na3P, which allow the desodiation to follow a kinetically rather than thermodynamically favourable path. The tomographic method allowed us to focus purely on the anode material to obtain the best possible data for PDF and Rietveld analysis and build up a 3-D picture of the anode based on operando atomic structure information extracted by both methods. We believe this technique can offer very significant benefits for future structural studies of crystalline and amorphous battery materials. Author Contributions SM and LM conceived and prepared the experiment; JS, MDM and SM performed the measurements; JS did the sample preparation and electrochemical characterisation; JS and MDM designed the sample container, processed and corrected the tomographic data; DSW performed the Rietveld refinements; GV performed the PDF analysis; PV performed the DFT calculations; the manuscript was prepared by DSW, with additions from the other co-authors.
