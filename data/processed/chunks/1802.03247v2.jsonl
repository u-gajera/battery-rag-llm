Introduction Alkaline metal-ion batteries are one of the most commonly used and investigated electrochemical power sources of today. Among these, Li-ion batteries (LIBs) provide the highest energy density and the best cycle life. Although they show an appreciable performance, the search for new electrode materials for these systems continues.1,2 Widely used electrodes, like LiMn2O4, LiCoO2, and LiNiO2, provide a noticeable performance and have found their application in commercial devices in spite of some drawbacks. Namely, the first commercial cathode material, LiCoO2, although having a high theoretical capacity, can effectively deliver only around 150 mA h g−1, in addition to its high price and pronounced toxicity.3 In contrast to the mentioned materials, vanadium pentoxide (V2O5) attracted significant attention of the research community due to its high energy density, low cost, easy preparation, availability, and relatively safe use.4–7 Li intercalation into V2O5 is followed by a series of first-order phase transitions, and reversible capacity corresponds to the phase LiV2O5. Further intercalation leads to irreversible transformations.8 With the theoretical capacity of approx. 294 mA h g−1 V2O5 outperforms commonly used cathode materials, making it a very promising cathode material for the next-generation of LIBs. In fact, the interest in V2O5 as an electrode material for rechargeable batteries (LIBs and other types of metal-ion batteries) has been revitalized due to the use of lithium metal as anode3 and extensive search for cathode materials beyond LIBs.3,9–12 The layered structure of V2O5 allows metal ion intercalation in-between V2O5 layers, causing the texture and morphology changes when metal ions are introduced into the structure.8 While the electrode materials obtained from V2O5 show higher energy and power density, and are generally easier to prepare than conventional materials, the main drawback is the decrease in capacity during cycling, which is assumed to arise from the issues associated with low conductivity and material degradation.13 One of the strategies to overcome the problems related to stability and to improve the electrode performance of V2O5 is doping by various transition metals.14,15 There are numerous reports in the literature showing the improved performance of doped V2O5 materials in rechargeable metal-ion batteries.", "page": 2, "position": 0}

V2O5 is rather challenging for conventional Density Functional Theory (DFT), since due to correlation effects DFT methods underestimate the band gap and cannot account for dispersion interactions important for the description of V2O5.26 In order to overcome the first problem, DFT+U approach 27,28 is often applied with satisfactory results.29,30 The problem of the crystal structure description is addressed either by addition of (semi) empirical van der Waals (vdW) -terms to the Generalized Gradient Approximation (GGA) calculations31 or using vdW-DF methods.32 In particular Londero and Schröder 32,33 have shown that GGA-PBE (Perdew, Burke and Ernzerhof34) and GGA-PW91 (Perdew and Wang35) approaches, either using ultrasoft pseudopotentials or projector-augmented wave (PAW36) approach, significantly overestimate the interlayer spacing (around ~12%). The same authors have shown that the predicted structure is also very sensitive to the choice of the exchange-correlation functional within non-local van der Waals density functional methods: vdW-DF137,38 and vdW-DF2.39 In fact, some of these functionals perform almost as poor as GGA-PBE in terms of structure description, while the energies of the interactions between V2O5 layers are estimated better. However, within the latter approach (the use of vdW-DF methods) the electronic structure of V2O5 is not described properly. To make the situation even more confusing, there are reports showing rather good agreement between the GGA results (PW91 results29) and experimental crystal structure. However, the agreement between theory and experiment became worse upon the addition of the on-site Coulomb correlation for the V 3d orbitals, in the attempt to describe the electronic structure better.29 The literature on the subject demonstrates that there is no consensus regarding the best way to treat V2O5 theoretically. One of the aims of the present work is to clarify this issue. As an adequate description of both electronic and crystal structures is required for a better understanding of materials performance, here we present a systematic analysis of V2O5 using plane wave DFT calculations. We show that a proper description of this material can be obtained by combining the DFT+U approach with", "page": 3, "position": 0}

Computational details The DFT calculations were performed using the GGA within Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof parametrization for the exchange correlation functional,34 applying the Quantum ESPRESSO (QE) ab initio package.41 The pseudopotential method with ultrasoft pseudopotentials (USPP)42, as implemented in QE, was used. The kinetic energy cutoff for the plane-wave basis set was 35 Ry, while the charge density cutoff was 16 times higher. Spin polarization was included in all the calculations. A simplified version of DFT+U developed by Cococcioni and de Gironcoli43 was used. The on-site Coulomb interaction was considered only for the vanadium 3d states and the value of U was changed systematically between 2 eV and 6 eV. In order to account for the long range dispersion interactions the semi-empirical correction in the formulation of Grimme (DFT+D2) was applied.40 The Brillouin zone was sampled using a Γ-centered k-point mesh, Gaussian smearing of 0.01 eV was applied to improve the convergence. We doped V2O5 by 3d transition metals (denoted hereafter as M) both interstitially, between the layers of V2O5, and substitutionally, by replacing one of the V atoms in the simulation cell. The simulation cell was constructed as a (1×1×2) supercell of V2O5, containing two V2O5 layers along the z-direction of the cell. The doping was done in every second layer or in-between layers, resulting in the stoichiometry corresponding to M0.25V1.75O5 (substitutional doping) or M0.25V2O5 (interstitial doping). Preliminary calculations have shown that interstitial dopants prefer highly coordinated sites where [MO6] octahedral units are formed, which agrees with some previous experimental observations.44 In the unit cell of pristine α-V2O5 this roughly corresponds to the crystal coordinates (0.5;0;z) where z is around 0.5. In pristine α-V2O5 (space group Pmmn) this corresponds to Wyckoff position 2b. Nevertheless, all the atoms were fully relaxed so the dopants could adjust their local environment. The concentration of dopants is somewhat larger than the ones usually considered experimentally, although in some cases even higher concentrations of dopants were used. Nevertheless, we are interested in the overall trends and consider them to be accounted properly using the same concentration of dopants for all systems.

A clear trend in the calculated lattice parameters versus increasing U is seen: parameter a decreases, while parameters b and c increase. While the relative errors obtained for a and b are less than 3% with respect to the experimental values, that is typical for PBE, parameter c, corresponding to the interlayer spacing, is overestimated by more than 13% and the error increases with the value of U (Fig. 1). Similar relative errors for parameter c (11.2%) were previously reported by Kerber et al.,31 who applied PBE combined with the PAW approach. The same authors were able to reduce the error down to 2.97% by adding the correction for dispersion interactions (with a and b fixed to the experimental values). Similarly, Londero and Schröder33 reported parameter c, which was overestimated by 11.5% and 12% for PBE with PAW and USPP, respectively. The work of Ganduglia-Pirovano and Sauer,47 using PW91 functional combined with PAW approach, overestimates c by 10.8%. All these results reflect a well-accepted fact that the interlayer interactions in bulk V2O5 are very weak and dispersive in nature. Figure 1.

When PBE+D2 is applied, the error for c is reduced down to 1.92%, i.e. 7 times compared to the PBE result. The impact of U on the lattice parameters is noticeable and it remains the same irrespectively on the addition of D2 correction. Therefore, we conclude that the addition of the D2 correction to PBE+U allows for the estimation of the lattice parameters with the relative error of a few percent only. Errors in the calculated lattice parameters are also translated into an overestimated unit cell volume (Fig. 2). It is clearly seen that the unit cell volume increases with U, with a relative error between 14% and 16% when dispersion interactions between the V2O5 layers are disregarded. This error arises almost exclusively from the error in parameter c and it is efficiently removed upon the addition of D2 correction. Even for the highest value of U the relative error found for the unit cell volume is below 4%, which we consider as an important improvement. When it comes to the battery applications of V2O5, the interlayer space provides the important diffusion paths for metal ions. Therefore, an incorrect interlayer distance would result in erroneous estimates of ion mobility in V2O5. Figure 2.

Fig. 3 shows that the width of the band gap increases practically linearly with U, from ~1.6 eV (PBE and PBE+D2, U = 0 eV) to ~2.3 eV (PBE+U and PBE+U +D2, U = 6 eV). The width of the valence band (around 5.5 eV) depends weakly on U and agrees with previously reported values.29,48 The band gap is correctly estimated for higher values of U (U = 5 eV and U = 6 eV). The experimentally determined values of the band gap of V2O5 are 2.0 eV49 and 2.2 eV,50 while Meyer et al.51 have recently reported a bit larger value of 2.8 eV using the combination of ultraviolet, inverse and x-ray photoemission spectroscopy.

The band gap determined with PBE is 1.6 eV, in agreement with previous work where the same level of theory has been used.29,52 The gap calculated with PBE+U shows better agreement with the experimental result, but it depends on the value of U and the applied DFT+U scheme. Most frequently, the approach of Dudarev et al.28 is applied with Ueff equal 3 eV or higher. Although the gap values close to the experimental ones have been found already for Ueff = 3 eV,29 in the literature there is no consensus about the optimum value of Ueff (or the values of U and J27).

It is also important to observe the impact of the D2 correction on the calculated band gap: PBE+U+D2 always gives slightly smaller band gaps than PBE+U. This is the consequence of the decrease of the interlayer spacing (Figs. 1 and 2). While the effects of the D2 correction and the U term on the lattice parameters are clear, it is also interesting to see how the chemical bonding within a single V2O5 layer is affected by them. The calculated bond lengths between vanadium and different oxygen atoms within the V2O5 layer (O(1), O(2) and O(3), Fig. 4) are summarized in Table 1. Figure 4. Notation of vanadium and oxygen atoms within a single V2O5 layer. Thin dashed lines show the interactions between the vanadyl O atoms of one V2O5 layer and vanadium atoms of a subsequent layer which are responsible for layer stacking in the bulk structure. We note that relative differences between the calculated values and those determined in experiments are only a few percents. There is no single rule about the effect of addition of U or D2 correction on the calculated bond lengths, but, to sum up, we do see that PBE+U+D2 in principle provides better agreement with experimental data than the PBE+U scheme (Table 1). We ascribe this to the fact that strong chemical bonding within V2O5 layers is only weakly affected by the D2 correction, as discussed also previously for similar systems with strong chemical bonds.53,54 It appears to be important to describe the interlayer interactions correctly. This is further supported by the fact that the contribution of dispersion interactions per V2O5 unit in our calculation is around 0.9 eV. This contribution depends only on the configuration of atoms in the simulation cell and it is affected by the value of U in an indirect fashion through the modification of the lattice parameters (Fig. 1). This value closely matches the interlayer binding energies obtained using the vdW-DF methods.33", "page": 8, "position": 0}

In overall, we conclude that the drawbacks of the GGA in the case of V2O5 are successfully compensated for using the combination of DFT+U and D2 methods. Hence, a relatively small increase of the computational costs for applying PBE+U+D2 is justified by the obtained results. We further apply the PBE+U+D2 scheme to study the structural and electronic changes in V2O5 upon doping with 3d metals. 3.2. Doped V2O5 Having achieved the satisfactory description of the pristine system, we further study how the crystal and electronic structure of bulk V2O5 can be modified by doping with 3d metals (from Sc to Zn). As mentioned earlier, we applied the PBE+U+D2 scheme for all the cases and applied on-site U correction only to the 3d states of vanadium. It should be noted that there is no unique strategy to select the value of U. Most often it is selected to fit to the experimental properties, which need to be reproduced to a satisfactory level.56 In the recent overview by Capdevila-Cortada et al.56 it was shown that a broad range of U values was used for d-elements: from 1 eV to 10 eV.56 As we are interested in the overall trends here, we chose not to apply U to the d-states of dopants. For comparison, all the calculations were also repeated using PBE, PBE+U and PBE+D2. We do not present the detailed results of those calculations here but their comparison allows us to conclude that the overall trends are reproduced by all of the approaches.

On the left the case of interstitial doping is shown while on the right substitutional doping is presented. The volume changes and magnetization induced upon doping are presented in Table 2. As can be seen, interstitial doping induces an expansion of the unit cell, which is expected as the dopant atom is inserted between the V2O5 layers. The distance between the two layers accommodating the interstitial dopant increases as compared to the interlayer spacing without the dopant atom in the same system (Fig. 5). The effect of the interstitial impurity is seen for both layers either due to the insertion (pillaring) or due to the impact on the interactions between vanadyl oxygen atoms (O(1) atoms) and the V atoms of the subsequent layer (Fig. 4). In contrast, the unit cell volume of substitutionally doped V2O5 is only slightly affected, changing within ±1%. In general, the small volume changes obtained for doped V2O5 agree with the experimental findings where the orthorhombic structure of parental V2O5 is usually found to be preserved. For example, for Cu-doped V2O5 only the volume increase by 1.96% was reported but no change of the crystal structure.14 It should be noted that in the case of doped V2O5 the addition of U and D2 corrections has a similar effect as in the case of pristine V2O5. Namely, when the supercell volumes for the PBE and PBE+U calculations are compared (not presented here), one can see that the latter are larger by roughly 5%. In contrast, when the D2 correction is added to PBE the supercell volume shrinks by approx. 10% for all the cases as a result of enhanced interlayer binding. The same also holds when the D2 correction is added to PBE+U.", "page": 10, "position": 0}

The spin polarization densities are presented in Fig. 6 for the case of Fe-doped V2O5.

When it comes to the electrochemical applications of materials, conductivity plays a very important role as a hindered electron transport could limit the electrode performance. We investigated the electronic structures of doped V2O5 and found that, in general, the band gap becomes narrower due to the introduction of new dopant states (Fig. 7). This indicates that the conductivity of doped V2O5 should increase compared to parental V2O5 as it was indeed observed in some experimental reports.16–21 In fact, by inspecting DOS curves (Fig. 7) one might see that practically a metallic behavior of otherwise insulating V2O5 is expected when doped with the elements between Mn and Ni. Therefore, it is clear that doping can be a powerful strategy for modifying the electrochemical and ion intercalation properties of V2O5.

Vertical dashed lines in the DOS plots indicate the Fermi levels. These states are not highly localized and can indeed contribute to the conductivity of doped V2O5. It is difficult to derive some definite conclusions regarding the specific effects of interstitial vs. substitutional doping. For example, interstitially Co-doped V2O5 has a small band gap (~0.5 eV) while the substitutionally doped one shows a metallic behavior. At the same time Mn-, Fe- and Ni-doped V2O5 are metallic, irrespective of the type of doping. However, it is interesting to note that in the case of substitutionally doped V2O5 the states located in the band gap span within the layer containing the dopant, while the other layer is like in pristine V2O5, in terms of the electronic structure. On the other hand, in the case of interstitial doping the states are distributed between the layers, which host the impurity. This also indicates that the chemical interactions between the impurities and the V and O atoms of V2O5 lattice are more pronounced in the case of substitutional doping and this is also reflected in the overlap between the d-states of the impurity and the valence band of V2O5. For example, one can compare the cases of Co-, Ni- and Cu-doped V2O5 (Fig. 7) where it is clear that the d-states of the substitutional impurities span over the entire valence band of V2O5. In contrast, the d-states of interstitial impurities are", "page": 14, "position": 0}

This also means that the chemical properties of interstitial and substitutional impurities, particularly in terms of the interactions with intercalated ions, will be rather different. Finally, a natural question, with no clear answer, remains – whether dopants will prefer substitutional of interstitial positions. Considering volume changes upon doping (Table 2) it seems that the elements from the first half of the 3d row of Periodic Table are relatively easily incorporated into the V2O5 lattice. These elements can be found in many oxidation states (especially Cr, Mn) allowing them to replace V5+ (this also applies to Co). In contrast, the elements with almost completed d-shell (Ni, Cu, Zn) have a limited number of oxidation states. Hence, we expect that, in reality, it would be difficult for these atoms to adapt to the coordination of V5+ in V2O5 structure. Naturally, we expect that the preference between substitutional and interstitial doping will also depend on the concentration of dopants. For example, Guan et al.22 described preparation and electrochemical properties of Mn-doped V2O5 in a very wide range of concentrations, from Mn0.27V2O5 (which is very close to our model) to Mn0.94V2O5. For low Mn concentrations the XRD patterns of Mn-doped V2O5 corresponded to that of pure V2O5 while for high concentrations of Mn the V2O5 interlayer spacing was found to significantly increase. When this result was combined with different types of V=O bonds evidenced in Raman spectra, it was concluded that Mn was inserted between V2O5 layers and distorted the V2O5 structure. Such different V=O bonds are clearly seen in Fig. 5 for the case of interstitially Mn-doped V2O5 (for the analysis of the effect of addition of U on Mn 3d states on the structure of Mn-doped V2O5 reader is referred to Supplementary Information).

The obtained results suggest that doping can be an elegant strategy for modifying structural and electronic properties of V2O5.

In order to demonstrate the effects we chose the cases of Mn and Co. Following the overview of Capdevila-Cortada et al.[S1] a wide range of values of U were applied so far for these two elements. For CoOx compounds U was found in the range 3.3 to 6.7 eV, and most frequently was chosen by fitting experimental properties. For MnOx compounds U was found in the range 1 to 6.63 eV. Here we see that the addition of U on dopants does not affect overall conclusions regarding the expansion of lattice (Table S1). The changes are much smaller in the case of substitutional doping. Also, an increase of the value of U applied onto dopant 3d states in general leads to the expansion of the lattice (Table S1). Table S1. Change of the unit cell volume (ΔV / %)* of Mn- and Co-doped V2O5 obtained by PBE+U+D2 calculations. The values of U applied on dopant 3d states was varied while the value of U applied to V 3d states was kept to 6 eV.

It can be seen that the effects of addition of U on Co 3d states (in addition to the V 3d states) affects the electronic structure, as expected. The case of interstitial doping is more sensitive to the addition of U on dopant states. In the case of substitutional doping we see that", "page": 20, "position": 0}
