INTRODUCTION Battery operated electric vehicles powered by renewable energy resources are considered the cleanest transportation option. The development of lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) has demonstrably revolutionized fields of communication and transportation 1. It has been reported that LIBs have long life cycles and high energy densities 2. However, the future of technology demands advancements beyond current LIBs. Compared to lithium, sodium is a cost-effective and earth abundant element that can be used to create large-scale rechargeable batteries in an effective and appealing way. Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) are emerging as a substitute of LIBs with comparable performances 3. The solid state electrolytes (SSEs) in batteries have many advantages over the liquid electrolytes such as improved safety, higher thermal and chemical stability, lower flammability and higher electrochemical stability of batteries 4, 5. Still, some problems exist with SSEs such as electrochemical instability, dendrite growth, large-scale synthesis and interfacial resistance 6, which require further improvement. The primary characteristics of an ideal solid-state electrolyte are a large electrochemical window, high ionic conductivity, low electrical conductivity and high thermal stability 7. Also, the material used for the solid-state electrolyte should have low activation energy and a band gap comparable to that of an insulator so that the ionic conductivity is increased and electronic conductivity is decreased 8. Among various SSEs, inorganic halides have been considered highly stable for SSBs 9. Also, a group of antiperovskites that are electronically inverted has been proposed 10, which was influenced by superionic conductivity of NaMgF3 and (K,Na)MgF3 perovskites at high temperature 10-13. The structural modifications in the typical ABX3 perovskite structure were reversed to the anti-perovskite notation X3BA according to the standard inorganic nomenclature of ionic compounds following \"cation-first\" approach14, where X is now large cation (often a metal), A is Anion (often a non-metal) and B is a monovalent anion.

The recent observation of Li-rich antiperovskites has opened up a new dimension of research for solid-state electrolytes 18. These materials showed high ionic conductivity, low melting points and three-dimensional conducting pathways. Also, Na+ has larger ionic radius compared to Li+ ion that helps in stabilization of the anti-perovskite structure 19. Thus, more research is needed in studying the properties of Na-rich antiperovskites (NaRAP). Recently, a series of NaRAPs, Na3HCh (Ch= S,Se,Te) were fabricated in which both anionic sites were occupied polarizable and soft anions of H- and Ch2- which helps in achieving higher ionic conductivity and lower activation energy20. Among these Na3HS was found to exhibit an orthorhombic structure whereas the rest of all structures were cubic in nature. Density functional theory (DFT) based First principles approach work hand-in-hand to guide the comprehension and development of battery materials such as electrolytes 21. For example, DFT calculations on Li10GeP2S12 have firstly clarified the 3D diffusion topology of the material 22. These calculations can also be used to gain an insight into the performance limits, activation energy, diffusivity, ionic conductivity and potential doping techniques to modify carrier concentration 23. Moreover, diffusion can also involve collective jumps and lattice vibrations which can be studied using ab-initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations by considering all possible motions of ions and their interactions. In this work, we investigated cubic phase c-Na3HS using DFT based first principles and AIMD simulations for solid state electrolytes. The structural, phase, dynamical, thermal and mechanical stability along with the electronic and electrochemical characteristics like - activation energy, diffusivity and ionic conductivity have been explored.

COMPUTATIONAL METHODOLOGY All the calculations were executed by utilizing the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package 24, using GGA approximation 25. The exchange of information between the core and valence electrons was studied employing the projected augmented wave (PAW) approach26. An 8×8×8 Monkhorst-Pack k-point grid, a plane wave cutoff energy of 450 eV and 10-5 eV energy convergence are used in the calculations. The conjugate gradient approach was implemented to minimize all energy until the Hellman–Feynman forces performing on all atoms were less than 10-3 eV/Å. For sodium, hydrogen and sulphur atoms, the pseudopotentials having valence configurations of 2p63s1, 1s1 and 3s23p4, respectively was used. To determine the dynamic stability of c-Na3HS, a phonon dispersion plot with a q-point mesh of 2×2×2 was obtained using density functional perturbation theory 27. To ensure an accurate calculation of electronic band structure of c-Na3HS, hybrid functional Heyd- Scuseria-Ernzerhof (HSE06) was used28, 29, as the conventional DFT is unable to estimate the band gap accurately. The thermal stability has been analysed via AIMD simulations within the NVT ensemble at 1000 K. To investigate the diffusivity, activation energy and ionic conductivity, AIMD simulations were performed on a 3×3×3 supercell with a total energy convergence of 10-4 eV. The total simulation time of the AIMD simulations was 50ps; with 2fs time steps. All simulations were implemented in the NVT ensemble while employing the Nose-Hover thermostat at 4 temperatures: 400K, 600K, 800K and 1000K. To analyse diffusive and ionic properties, Python Materials Genomics (PyMatGen) library 30 has been used.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS 3.1 Structure and stability analysis c-Na3HS is an antiperovskite structure as depicted in Figure 1(a) that crystallizes in the cubic Pm-3m space group. The relaxed c-Na3HS unit cell holds five atoms having a lattice constant 4.39 Å. S atom is bonded to 12 equivalent Na atoms to form SNa12 cuboctahedra that share corners with 12 equivalent SNa12 cuboctahedra and, faces with eight equivalent HNa6 octahedra. Four comparable S atoms and two analogous H atoms are bound to Na atom in a linear geometry. H atom is linked to six equivalent Na atoms to form HNa6 octahedra and faces 8 equivalent SNa12 cuboctahedra. The structural stability of material can also be assessed theoretically using the phase diagram which can be built based on free energy. The phase stability of material with a clearly defined chemical composition is evaluated using the energy above the hull, or Ehull. A stable compound often possesses an Ehull of 0 or lower while a higher Ehull indicates that it is likely to be unstable 32. In order to create a phase diagram, a suitable free energy model for the system of choice must be used to compare the relative thermodynamic stability of the phases that make up the system 33. For an isothermal closed Na-H-S system, Gibbs free energy, G is the most appropriate thermodynamic potential, which is a Legendre transform of the internal energy, E and enthalpy, in the following way: 34 G(T, P, NNa, NH, NS) = H(T, P, NNa, NH, NS) – TS(T, P, NNa, NH, NS) = E(T, P, NNa, NH, NS) + PV(T, P, NNa, NH, NS) – TS(T, P, NNa, NH, NS) (1) Where, T represents temperature, P is pressure, S depicts entropy, V denotes volume and Ni is the number of atoms in the system of species Na. Here, PV term can be neglected as PΔV is small. Therefore, the expression of G reduces to E at 0K temperature.", "page": 5, "position": 0}

The stable phases with green dots and energy above Hull for c-Na3HS are also shown. For c-Na3HS, the energies of most of the reported phases were calculated in the Na-H-S chemical space. Next, the convex hull of four-dimension (E, xNa, xH, xS) space was formed at 0 K to create the phase diagram, where xi is the atomic portion of element X and E is the normalised energy per atom. Now, in the compositional coordinate space of Na-H-S, the phase diagram is produced by projecting the vertices on the convex hull. From the ternary phase diagram of c-Na3HS (Figure 1(b)), the energy above hull was calculated to be 78 meV/atom, which indicates the cubic phase of Na3HS is energetically stable. Thermal and dynamical stability We now investigated the thermal stability of c-Na3HS at 1000 K for 15 ps (Figure 2(a)). The energy versus time steps plot shows that the energy undergoes marginal fluctuations in its value and the geometry of the c-Na3HS structure is slightly distorted without breaking of bonds which suggests that c-Na3HS maintains its thermal stability at high temperature.", "page": 6, "position": 0}

The calculated phonon spectrum shows that the imaginary frequencies are absent throughout the whole Brillouin zone confirming the dynamic stability of structure c-Na3HS. Mechanical Stability. In the design of a solid state electrolyte, ensuring mechanical stability and evaluating the mechanical properties are essential, as it affect the battery manufacturing, operation and performance9. The mechanical stability is investigated by determining whether the Born stability criteria for cubic systems 35 is satisfied or not. It is observed that the necessary and sufficient Born stability criteria is satisfied: 𝐶11−𝐶12 > 0 ; 𝐶11+2𝐶12 > 0 ; 𝐶44 (2) This establishes the fact that c-Na3HS exhibits mechanically stability. Various mechanical properties such as Young’s modulus (Y), Bulk modulus (B), Shear modulus (G) and Pugh’s ratio (B/G) have also been calculated. A comparative analysis with some of the commonly used sodium-ion solid-state electrolyte materials is given in Table 1.", "page": 7, "position": 0}

Also, these values are comparable to that of Na3OBr. This observation places c-Na3HS in the category of materials having moderate hardness. This level of hardness is sufficient to withstand any external stresses in solid-state SIBs. On the other hand, a certain degree of softness is required in the material to achieve maximum electrode contact 9. c-Na3HS has lower values of Y than NASICON, Na3OCl and Na3OBr indicating that it has a certain degree of softness. The Pugh’s ratio underscores the brittle or ductile nature of a material. Any material having Pugh’s ratio less than 1.75 can show brittle nature 37. From Table 1 it is observed that NASICON is truly ductile in nature. c-Na3HS is observed to have the lowest Pugh’s ratio among other reported structures, which makes it slightly more brittle than other materials mentioned. The hardness and certain degree of softness in c-Na3HS makes it suitable for consideration for solid-state electrolyte material. 3.2 Electronic Structure The electronic band structure of c-Na3HS is calculated in the Brillouin zone, using more accurate description of exchange-correlation in the calculations 38, along high-symmetry points. The electronic band structure of c-Na3HS (Figure 3) reveals that it has an indirect band gap of 4.25 eV (HSE06 functional) and 3.2 eV when calculated using GGA-PBE functional with conduction band minima at X and valence band maxima at M point.

The states near Fermi level in valance band and conduction band side are primarily contributed by S and Na atoms, respectively. The band gap of c-Na3HS establishes it to be suitable candidate for solid-state electrolyte in SIBs. 3.3 Diffusive and Ionic properties. For designing an efficient solid-state electrolyte, diffusivity, activation energy and ionic conductivity are crucial parameters which have been investigated by performing AIMD simulations on the supercell of the c-Na3HS structure. We assessed the diffusion properties of Na-ions, by computing the self-diffusion coefficient of sodium ions based on AIMD trajectories. Mean square displacement (MSD) for Na-ions in the electrolyte c-Na3HS materials is calculated at 400K, 600K, 800K and 1000 K, within a 50 ps time step window (Figure 4 (a)). It is evident that the MSD of Na increases slowly at lower temperatures but at 1000 K it starts showing a linear relationship with time steps. The MSD plots hints that the diffusivity is very low at lower temperatures but increases at 1000 K.

This approach tailors a variety of material properties, such as distribution of charges, electronic properties, and surface stability. We now explore the effect of introducing vacancy in c-Na3HS on the ionic conductivity and activation energy. The vacancy is introduced by removing single Na-atom from a 3×3×3 supercell of c- Na3HS which leads to the composition of c-Na2.96HS. This composition is optimized with no change in the lattice parameters of the cell. MSDs were calculated for Na2.96HS composition at 400, 600, 800 and 1000 K, within a 50 ps window. From Figure 5, it is evident that the MSDs increase linearly with time and also with increasing temperatures. The MSD plot increases linearly with time for c-Na2.96HS as compared to nearly flat MSD curve for pristine c-Na3HS (Figure S3, ESI). For the composition Na2.96HS, the MSD plots hint at the increased movement of Na-ions leading to higher values of diffusion coefficients and hence higher ionic conductivity. From the Arrhenius plot (Figure 5(b)), the activation energy, 𝐸𝑎, for Na2.96HS is evaluated to be 0.12 ± 0.0067 eV, which is lower than the pristine c-Na3HS (0.298 ± 0.05 eV).

Thus, the obtained ionic conductivity is of the order of ~ 3 magnitude larger than the pristine c-Na3HS’s ionic conductivity of (Table 3).

Along with vacancies, we also explored the doping strategy which alters charge carrier concentration of pristine structure leading to the formation of ionisable entities inside structure that affect mobility and conductivity. The vacancies can also be introduced via substitutional doping strategy which requires charge compensation. In this case, one Cl atom took the place of one S atom and for charge compensation one Na atom was removed from a 3×3×3 supercell of c-Na3HS. This led to the composition of Na2.96HS0.96Cl0.04.

To elucidate this more, the radial distribution functions (RDFs) for Cl and Br atoms are shown in Figure 6 (b). On increasing the ionic radius from Cl to Br, the first peak of Na-distributions becomes narrower indicating the Na positions are well-defined in the structure doped with Br than in the Cl-doped structure. The shift in the first peak is due to the increased ionic radius of Br atom. To achieve future- focused solid electrolytes, it is essential to comprehend the mechanisms that both enhance and impede sodium-ion conductivity 4. CONCLUSIONS In summary, first principles DFT and AIMD simulations have been utilized to explore the ability and suitability of c-Na3HS to be regarded as potential solid-state electrolyte for sodium-ion batteries. The stability analysis shows good thermal and dynamical stability of c- Na3HS with minimum energy fluctuations and lack of any imaginary frequencies in plot of phonon dispersion, respectively. The phase stability analysis established that c-Na3HS is energetically stable with energy-above hull of 78 meV/atom. Moreover, the mechanical stability hints at the material's moderate hardness, which is desired in a solid-state electrolyte material. The AIMD simulations performed on pristine c-Na3HS help to obtain understanding about the diffusive and ionic properties of c-Na3HS. The study concludes that the c-Na3HS can be a potential solid-state electrolyte by enhancing its properties via vacancies and doping halogen atoms in the structure of sodium-ion batteries.
