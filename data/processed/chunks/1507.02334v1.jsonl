Both electrons and Li+ can move at the electrode-surface ﬁlm interface in response to the voltage, which adds complexity to the “electric double layer” (EDL). We apply Density Functional Theory (DFT) to investigate how the applied voltage is manifested as changes in the EDL at atomic lengthscales, including charge separation and interfacial dipole moments. Illus- trating examples include Li3PO4, Li2CO3, and LixMn2O4 thin-ﬁlms on Au(111) surfaces under ultrahigh vacuum conditions. Adsorbed organic solvent molecules can strongly reduce voltages predicted in vacuum. We propose that manipulating surface dipoles, seldom discussed in battery studies, may be a viable strategy to improve electrode passivation. We also distinguish the com- puted potential governing electrons, which is the actual or instantaneous voltage, and the “lithium cohesive energy”-based voltage governing Li content widely reported in DFT calculations, which is a slower-responding self-consistency criterion at interfaces. This distinction is critical for a com- prehensive description of electrochemical activities on electrode surfaces, including Li+ insertion dynamics, parasitic electrolyte decomposition, and electrodeposition at overpotentials. keywords: lithium ion batteries; voltage prediction; density functional theory; computational elec- trochemistry 1", "page": 0, "position": 0}

INTRODUCTION Unlike pristine noble metal or graphite basal-plane electrodes used in classical electric double layer (EDL) studies,1,2 lithium ion battery (LIB) electrodes generally exhibit complex interfaces.3,4 Both electron (e−) and Li+ transport can occur inside LIB electrodes. In addition, solid thin ﬁlms, on the order 1-50 nm thick, are ubiquitous on LIB electrode surfaces and can become part of the EDL (Fig. 1a-h). The EDL is critical because key battery processes like Li+ incorporation kinetics (including Li+ desolvation), parasitic reactions, Li- plating, and degradation-inducing phase transformations on electrode surfaces most likely initiate within it. Indeed, “solid electrolyte interphase” (SEI) ﬁlms3,5–7 covering anodes are relied upon as kinetic barriers that prevent thermodynamic equilibrium in batteries; they are critical for LIB which operate outside the redox stability window of the organic solvent electrolytes used. As discussed below, the EDL is also crucial in computational work because it eﬀectively determines the electrode potential (henceforth “applied voltage” or simply “voltage”) in the simulation cell. Our work examines EDL associated with thin-ﬁlm coated electrode surfaces, and emphasizes the importance of creating electrode interface models that exhibit consistent electrochemical activities for both Li+ and e−. Examples of solid ﬁlms on electrode surfaces include Li2CO3 layers formed on pris- tine cathode oxide surfaces;8–11 cathode-coating ﬁlms made of electrolyte decomposition products;3,12–17 SEI ﬁlms on anodes arising from reductive decomposition of liquid electrolyte components;3,5–7 artiﬁcial protective/passivating coatings,18 including atomic layer deposi- tion (ALD) layers19,20 which can undergo phase transformations at low voltages;21,22 ALD layers between solid electrolytes and electrodes in all-solid state batteries;23 and even Li2O2 ﬁlms deposited on cathodes during fast discharge of Li-air batteries,24,25 the re-oxidation of which is accompanied by signiﬁcant voltage hysteresis and is a root cause of the lack of a suitable liquid electrolyte in Li-air batteries. Detailed atomic lengthscale understanding of the interfaces and EDL associated with such thin ﬁlms has remained elusive, partly due to challenges in imaging buried interfaces at sub-nanometer resolution. Even EDLs associated with liquid organic electrolyte in bat- teries have arguably only recently received systematic experimental studies.26–28 Modeling eﬀorts have made much progress in elucidating the structures", "page": 1, "position": 0}

In this work, we apply electronic Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations to investigate how voltages aﬀect the structures and stoichiometries of thin solid ﬁlms, their interfaces, and their EDL at atomic lengthscales. In view of the complexities of LIB electrodes, we have adopted simple model systems. The liquid electrolyte is omitted, although a few solvent molecules are included as frozen monolayers in some models to illus- trate their huge impact on the voltage. Au(111) surfaces are adopted as model cathodes, instead of transition metal oxides typically found in batteries. Au does not alloy with Li un- der voltages considered in this work and is a convenient inert electrode. These systems might be realized in ultra-high vacuum (UHV) settings; they dovetail with the use of copper37 and gold38 electrodes in recent fundamental battery science experimental studies. The model thin ﬁlms examined in this work, in order of increasing complexity, are Li3PO4 (010) (Fig. 2a),30,39 Li2CO3 basal plane (Fig. 2b),40–46 and LixMn2O4 (111) (Fig. 2c).34 These are coated on Au(111) on one side and face a vacuum region on the other. Li3PO4 is a non- redox-active solid electrolyte. It illustrates the correlation between interfacial dipole densi- ties and voltages. Li2CO3 is often found on as-synthesized cathode surfaces. In LIB studies, there is disagreement9 concerning whether Li2CO3 dissolves upon soaking in electrolyte,8,10 is formed at high voltages,11 or is removed at >4 V.9 In Li-air batteries, Li2CO3 is gener- ally accepted to be oxidized and removed above ∼4.5 V.25 Our goal is not to elucidate the detailed reaction mechanism, but to study the electronic and structural signatures accompa- nying voltage increase. Redox-active LiMn2O4 (spinel LMO) is not used as nanometer-thick ﬁlms in batteries, but its inclusion here helps illustrate the diversity of interfacial behavior (Fig. 1). Like most LIB cathode materials, LMO is a polaron conductor because Mn can exhibit multiple redox states. It also conducts Li+, but is not a band (“metallic”) conduc- tor.

The absolute electrochemical potential for a charged particle in an atomic conﬁguration is the (free) energy needed to transfer it into a given phase from inﬁnity (see, e.g., Ref. ? ). There can be diﬀerences whether the particle is a Li+ or a e−. In DFT modeling, the electronic voltage (Ve) governing electronic motion, and ionic voltage (Ve) governing Li+ motion, can and must be distinguished. First we focus on Ve. Under constant voltage experimental conditions, potentiostats directly control the e−(not Li) content. When the phase is a metallic conductor with a well-deﬁned EF, the voltage asociated with transferring e−from inﬁnity, multiplied by the electronic charge, is equal to the work function (Φ) modulo a constant, just like in photo- voltaics (PV)48 and electrocatalytic systems.49 Φ=Evac −EF, where Evac is the vacuum level and EF is set to zero herein without loss of generality. If the electrode is immersed in liquid electrolyte, Φ calculated for the electrode covered by a suﬃciently thick liquid layer, divied by the electronic charge, also gives Ve.50,95 Ve applies even under out-of-equilibrium condi- tions. It is readily computed in our model systems because vacuum regions exist and qualify as “inﬁnity.” In commercial batteries, there is no vacuum. Nevertheless, our focus on Φ is formally correct and emphasizes the synergy between batteries, fuel cells,68 PV,48,51–53 and metal-semiconductor interfaces.54,55 In those research areas, dipoles at interfaces are recog- nized as properties of paramount importance.

We deﬁne the Li “voltage” (Vi) as the (free) energy diﬀerence between Li chemical potential in a system and the lithium metal cohesive energy per Li divided by |e|. This deﬁnition is widely used as the sole voltage estimate in the LIB theory literature.56–59 At equilibrium, when the voltage is pinned at the redox potential of Li-insertion reactions, Ve must be equal to Vi. Thus Vi should be considered a self-consistent criterion at interfaces. By itself, Vi can give incorrect voltages when model- ing parasitic processes induced by e−transfer, and it may not govern the dynamics of Li+ insertion processes adequately. 6", "page": 5, "position": 0}

Sec. 2 discusses and reconciles diﬀerent deﬁnitions of volt- age in DFT calculations in more detail. Sec. 3 describes the methods used. The results are given in Sec. 4 and Sec. 5 summarizes the paper. A supporting information (S.I.) document provides further details about our three model systems, compares the modeling of battery interfaces with geochemical60–62 and other liquid-oxide interfaces,63,64 and discusses Li2CO3 oxidation thermodynamics. Experimentalist readers are encouraged to skip to Sec. IV. II. VOLTAGE CALIBRATION IN DFT CALCULATIONS DFT calculations are conducted at constant number of electrons, not constant electro- chemical potential. Estimating and maintaining voltages in periodically replicated, con- densed phase DFT simulation cells have long been recognized as a challenge.49,50,65–71 Re- cently we have applied an ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD)-based Li+ transfer free energy method to predict voltage dependences of redox processes at interfaces between liq- uid electrolytes and lithium-intercalated graphite.72,73 AIMD has also been coupled with continuum approximations of liquid electrolytes to model constant voltage conditions on pristine electrodes.65 But present-day AIMD simulation time scales are too short to extend to Li+ motion inside LIB electrodes or the surface ﬁlms coating them except at signiﬁcantly elevated temperatures. This work focuses on how applied voltages aﬀect solid ﬁlms. Thus we model solid interfaces at zero temperature. With suﬃcient equilibration time and in the presence of Li+ and e−reservoirs, the total number of electrons (ne) and Li+ content (nLi+) in an electrode in a LIB are governed by the chemical potentials for electrons (µe) and Li+ ions (µLi+), respectively. EF of a metallic electrode is µe modulo a constant. Here we have not used ¯µe or ¯µLi+, the notations for total electrochemical potentials of e−and Li+,1 precisely because constant-charge DFT calculations and terminologies are being applied to infer constant-potential electrochemical properties. Surface potential contributions to ¯µ’s should naturally be present in our simulation cells, which feature explicit interfaces. 7", "page": 6, "position": 0}

Electronic Voltage (Ve) from Work Function The electronic voltage of an atomic conﬁguration which is band conductor, imposed by a potentiostat, not necessarily at equilibrium with respect to nLi or the Li+ occupation sites, is deﬁned as Ve = Φ/|e| −1.37 V, (1) if the Li+/Li(s) reference is used.74 In the literature, values of 1.39 V and 1.44 V have been adopted; the small discrepancy is a measure of possible systematic error. In the DFT formulation, the e−conﬁguration ﬁnds its ground state instantaneously. Ve pertains to inﬁnitesimal changes in ne, which leaves the system uncharged. Note that Refs. 72 and 73 deal with Ve despite the fact that Li+ is transferred, because the excess e−is left on the metallic electrode at its Fermi level. As stated in Ref. 73, the free energy of that graphite edge-plane system has yet to be optimized with respect to the surface Li-content. In the present work, Ve are always reported for locally optimized atomic conﬁgurations so that all forces are zero. B. Lithium Metal Cohesive Energy (Vi) for Voltage In the “lithium cohesive energy” (Vi) approach, discrete and matched numbers of e−and Li+ are added/subtracted simultaneously: µLi = E(nLi+, ne) −E(nLi+ −1, ne −1) = E(nLi+, ne) −E(nLi+ −1, ne) + E(nLi+, ne) −E(nLi+, ne −1) ≈µLi+ + µe. (2) The last equality holds when the system approaches inﬁnite size. Here E(nLi+, ne) is the zero temperature total energy after optimization of all interior degrees of freedom. The T = 0 K voltage is then given by Vi = (µLi −ELi(s))/|e|, (3) where ELi(s) is the cohesive energy of lithium metal, predicted to be 1.57 eV using the DFT/PBE functional. No net charge is introduced. There is an ambiguity concerning whether µLi(nLi) should be E(nLi + 1) −E(nLi) or E(nLi1) −E(nLi −1). We have chosen 8", "page": 7, "position": 0}

In the literature, Vi is generally averaged over a wider range of Li content than in the present work.56,57 Ve and Vi are not necessarily equal. A transparent example is a pristine Li metal slab in vacuum. Vi=0 by deﬁnition. Yet the work function of Li(100) is reported to be 2.93 eV.75 This translates into an electronic voltage of Ve=1.51 V (Eq. 1)! Indeed, if the Li surface is covered with a poor SEI that allows e−transfer but Li+ transfer is slowed to beyond experimental timescales – the opposite of what a good SEI does – the lithium slab acts as an e−emitter, the voltage of which must be governed by its EF. For Li(s) to truly exhibit 0 V vs. the LIB Li+/Li(s) reference in e−transfer processes, net surface charge densities and electrode-electrolyte interface contributions must be accounted for. Organic solvent decomposition can occur on uncharged Li (100) surface under UHV conditions despite the relatively high (1.51 V) potential, but in these reactions the metal surface is a reactant and Li+ are produced. C. Relation between Ve and Vi (1) Ve=Vi at equilibrium. Under this condition, Vi controls the Li content. Thus Eq. 3 should be interpreted as a self-consistency criterion. µLi=(Φ-1.37 eV+1.57 eV) from Eqs. 1, 3, and the PBE estimate of ELi(s). Identifying Φ as µe, Eq. 2 implies that µLi+ becomes a voltage-independent 0.20 eV. This reﬂects that Li+ is in excess in an inﬁnite reservoir. A related point has been made in the fuel cell literature.68 In that case H+ con- centration at the interface, governed by the pH, is also strongly coupled to the predicted voltage. (2) When Vi<Ve, and the voltage is held ﬁxed by the potentiostat, and Li+ and e−sources are present, the Li content should spontaneously decrease (as permitted by kinetics) so that Vi rises towards Ve.

This may not occur in all cases. For example, when all available Li+ insertion sites are ﬁlled in fully lithiated LiC6, the electrode becomes supercapacitor-like. Ve now controls the net surface electronic charge,72 and Vi ceases to matter. Conducting simulations under such non-equilibrium conditions are crucial to understanding many phenomena in batteries. An example is the kinetics of metal plating4,76,77 at overpotentials – an explicitly non-equilibrium phenomenon, a major safety issue in LIB, but also a critical process for batteries featuring rechargeable metal anodes. This discussion highlights the primacy of Ve when computing voltages. Eq. 3 was originally applied to bulk crystalline electrode simulation cells, and Vi has been identiﬁed as the redox potential.56,57,80 Li should remain in the solid when the applied potential is lower than Vi. In these special cases of simulation cells without interfaces, the Li(s) cohesive energy approach (Vi) is neither consistent nor inconsistent with Ve. This is because the electrostatic potential at any point in space is only deﬁned to within a constant in the interior of a crystal;78 therefore neither Ve nor EF is well-deﬁned without specifying interfaces. Thus metals terminated in diﬀerent crystal facets exhibit diﬀerent Φ’s.79 Much more signiﬁcant changes in Φ can be induced using adsorbed molecules.48 Using DFT+U or hybrid DFT functional methods, Vi has generally been predicted to be in good agreement with measured open circuit voltages in bulk transition metal oxide simulation cells. The errors are at most a few hundred meVs.80 This suggests that interfacial contributions may be small on most battery cathode surfaces. Our work suggests that artiﬁcial interfaces can be potentially be engineered to give larger, beneﬁcial eﬀects. Molecular adsorption eﬀects will be emphasized in Sec. IV D. DFT calculations of interfaces are usually performed in ﬁnite-sized, periodically-replicated simulation cells kept at overall charge neutrality. In the literature, in DFT calculations without ions in the electrolyte (or without any electrolyte at all), the Vi approach has therefore assigned a wide range of voltages to LIB interfaces", "page": 9, "position": 0}

METHODS DFT calculations are conducted using the Vienna Atomic Simulation Package (VASP) version 5.381–83 and the PBE functional.84 Modeling spinel LixMn2O4 requires spin-polarized DFT and the DFT+U augmented treatment85 of Mn 3d orbitals. The U and J values depend on the orbital projection scheme and DFT+U implementation details; here U −J =4.85 eV is chosen to taken from the literature.80 The charge state on Mn ions are determined from the approximate local spin polarzation sz reported by the VASP code; |sz|=3/2, 4/2, and 5/2 are assigned to Mn(IV), Mn(III), and Mn(II), respectively. For Li3PO4 and Li2CO3, most calculations exclude spin-polarization. A few spin-polarized calculations are performed to conﬁrm that this is adequate. A 400 eV planewave energy cutoﬀand a 3×3×1 Monkhorst- Pack grid are applied in all cases. Increasing the cutoﬀor the k-grid changes the predicted absolute energies by at most 0.1 eV; energy diﬀerences, which are the relevant quantities, are much smaller. Our model systems are asymmetric slabs: Li2CO3 basal plane, Li3PO4 (010), and LiMn2O4 (111) slabs on one side of 4-layer thick Au(111) (Fig. 2). The standard dipole cor- rection is applied to negate image interactions in the periodically replicated, charge-neutral simulation cells.86 Au is a metallic conductor and its EF is well deﬁned. Work functions (Φ) are the diﬀerences between EF and vacuum levels. Two vacuum-surface interfaces exist per asymetric slab, and two vacuum levels, for bare and coated Au(111) respectively, are obtained.48 Four layers of Au atoms do not give a completely converged Φ for uncoated Au(111). Therefore we have shifted the two computed Φ of each system by the diﬀerence between the predicted Au(111) Φ, and the fully converged Au(111) Φ=5.15 eV.87 The shift is at most 0.1 eV. We also report the net surface dipole density (δ), which is the total dipole moment of the simulation cell in the direction perpendicular to the surface divided by the lateral surface area. The dipole moment is computed as the sum of all charges (including electron density deﬁned on a grid) multipled by their displacement from a user-speciﬁed cen- ter of the cell, and is reported", "page": 10, "position": 0}

Au(111)/Li3PO4/Vacuum (Fig. 3a for Summary) First we examine the Ve of a non-redox active system: a thin β-Li3PO4 (010) solid electrolyte ﬁlm on Au(111). We start with the stochiometric Li3PO4 slab with all Li+ sites occupied (∆N(Li)=0, Fig. 2a). The work function is Φ=4.23 eV. This translates into Ve=2.86 V vs. Li+/Li(s), which is reduced from the bare, charge-neutral Au(111) surface value Ve=3.78 V (Φ=5.15 V) by 0.88 eV. In the absence of Au, the Li3PO4 slab is symmetric and does not exhibit a net dipole moment. The fact that it modiﬁes the Au Φ is not due to charge transfer between Au and Li3PO4. The spatially decomposed electronic density of state (DOS) (Fig. 4a) shows that the phosphate Kohn-Sham valence band edge, located at about −1.5 eV of the phosphate,88 is far from the Fermi level residing on Au orbitals. The Li3PO4 conduction band edge is higher than 5 eV and the vacuum level is at 4.23 eV (not shown in the panel). Thus the stoichiometric slab must have induced image charges which set up surface dipoles. Indeed, the net surface dipole density (δ) of the entire simulation cell is predicted to be ﬁnite; δ=−0.0048 |e|/˚A, or −0.023 Debye/˚A2. The negative sign means that the dipole points into Li3PO4 from Au (111). Using ∆Ve = 4πδ/(|e|), (4) where all quantities are in atomic units, this “small” δ should yield a large −0.86 V shift between bare and phosphate-coated Au(111). This explains the −0.88 V diﬀerence deduced 12", "page": 11, "position": 0}

DFT calculations give an aggregate δ, that includes screening, induced-dipoles, and depolarization eﬀects, not individual contributions. Hence no eﬀective dielectric constant is present in Eq. 4.55 Under strictly UHV conditions, no net charge can be introduced. Net bulk or surface charges lead to inﬁnite repulsive energies due to long-ranged coulombic repulsion. In- stead, we raise the voltage by removing matched Li+/e−pairs, as is normally done in DFT calculations.33,80 The conﬁguration space associated with removing multiple Li is large. We assume that Li vacancies are weakly interacting, and their formation energetics only depend on their positions in the z direction, perpendicular to the surface.

See Fig. 2 caption for color key. diﬀerent conﬁgurations with all Li-vacancies right at the interface are indeed found to yield total energies within 30 meV of each other. Removing one Li (i.e., ∆N(Li)=−1) from the Li3PO4 layer in contact with Au is most energetically favorable (Fig. 5a). It also gives the lowest Ve at this nLi content. The DOS there reveals no charge transfer between Au and Li3PO4 (Fig. 4b). Some spurious Li3PO4 “orbitals” in contact with Au(111) are above −1.0 eV, but they likely arise from the arbitary spatial decomposition scheme; the valence band edge should be taken as −1 eV where at least two layers of Li3PO4 atoms exhibit the same orbital level.88 A net negative charge must remain at the Li-vacancy site, compensated by a positive charge on Au(111) (Fig. 1e). This charge separation modiﬁes δ to −0.0029 |e|/˚A which should yield a voltage shift of −0.53 V from the bare Au(111) value. Using explicit Φ calculations, Ve is found to rise to 3.28 V, shifted from the Au(111) Ve by −0.52 V (Table 1), which is quantatitively explained by the change in δ. The phosphate valence band edge is raised by about 0.45 eV relative with EF on the Au surface (Fig. 4b). Removing more Li at the phosphate-gold interface augments δ in the positive direction, increases Ve (Table 1), and raises the valence band edge proportionately (Fig. 4c). Finally, removing a single Li inside the phosphate slab (Fig. 4d) or at the phosphate-vacuum interface (Fig. 4e) yields a larger Ve than if the vacancy is right at the Au(111) surface (Table 1). In the latter case, the phosphate valence band edge now coincides with EF. So far we have not discussed the ionic voltage (Vi) governing the Li content. Table 1 14", "page": 13, "position": 0}

The two voltage deﬁnitions should intersect at only one point. Ve approaches Vi between ∆N(Li)=−1 to −2. Away from that solid- state PZC, equilibrium (Ve=Vi) can be achieved with a net surface charge compensated by liquid electrolytes (Fig. 1g, Sec. IV D), just like on noble metal electrodes. Models with non-equilibrium interfacial Li content are “wrong” in the sense that they only have transient existence. Removing a Li sitting deeper inside the phosphate layer (Fig. 1f, 5b) shows signs of yielding self-consistency: Ve=3.78 V, Vi=3.69 V (Table 1). However, the relative free energy (∆G) of this alternatve ∆N(Li)=−1 conﬁguration, evaluated using ∆G = G(∆N(Li)) −G(0) −∆N(Li)µLi , (5) is less favorable than ∆N(Li)=−3 where all Li vacancies are at the interface (Table 1, ﬁfth column), at a similar Li chemical potential (µLi=Vi). In general, if Vi increases upon successive Li removal right at the interface, Eq. 5 favors removing multiple Li there, rather than removing a single Li further inside the slab – even if the latter yields the same Vi. Thus Fig. 1f should not be a candidate for equilibrium interfaces,68 at least under these UHV conditions. If a liquid electrolyte is present, it cannot be ruled out that Li+ vacancy near the outer surface may be stabilized; we speculate that this could even yield a multitude of equilibrium Li+ conﬁgurations in Li-containing ﬁlms, and therefore more than one PZC at diﬀerent voltages. B. Electrostatics-based Passivation Strategy These results emphasize that the interfacial dipole density (δ) is one atomic lengthscale determinant of applied voltages. From Eq. 4, a thin dipole sheet is expected to give rise to a step-like voltage drop at the interior interface of Li3PO4 (Fig. 1e), which is therefore not an inert, passive coating (Fig. 1d). At long enough times such that Li+ can insert and relax their conﬁgurations, this solid electrolyte should absorb much of the voltage drop/rise at the sharp metal/electrolyte interface.

No adsorbed molecule exists. work analogously; in that case, the ﬁlm, or at least its interface with the anode, must be able to incorporate extra Li.96 The above discussions suggest a new design principle for “smart” artiﬁcial SEI passi- vating lithium ion battery anodes and high-voltage cathodes. Traditional SEI relies on Li+-conducting but e−insulating ﬁlms to slow down e−tunneling from electrodes to organic- solvent based electrolytes. They are not designed to aﬀect the voltage experienced by the liquid electrolyte, which thermodynamically speaking should still decompose at battery op- erating conditions. Our proposed scheme focuses on local thermodynamics, not e−tunneling kinetics. A fast Li+ transport rate is crucial for successful implementation of passivation based on Li+-motion induced interfacial dipoles. Another route, not involving Li motion, is to incorporate permanent dipoles that can re-orient, such as ferroelectric ﬁlms (Fig. 1b). Fer- roelectric surfaces have already been used to manipulate photochemical reactivities.89 Most ferrorelectrics are not Li+ conductors. However, electrostatic eﬀects are long-ranged, and it is likely that non-continuous ferrorelectric ﬁlms, lined with gaps that Li+ can pass through, can serve to reduce extreme voltages experienced by liquid electrolytes. C. Au/Li2CO3/vacuum (Fig. 3b) for Summary The band alignment between Au(111) and the stoichiometric Li2CO3 basal plane (Fig. 2b) is similar to that predicted for Au/Li3PO4. In the S.I., the Au(111)/Li2CO3(001) interface is also shown to be qualitatively similar. The broad correspondence suggests that the predicted behavior is universal for non-redox-active ﬁlms. The valance and conduction band edges of the ∆N(Li)=0 basal Li2CO3 slab bracket the Au Fermi level (Fig. 6a), indicating no e−transfer.

Next, we raise the voltage and try to oxidize Li2CO3.9,25 by removing successive Li+/e−pairs. The most favorable Li vacancies are at the Au/carbonate interface (Fig. 7a-b). As Li are further removed (Fig. 7c, Fig. 6b-c), Ve increases (Table 2). The valence band also rises until the occupied states at the Au/carbonate interface reaches EF (Fig. 6d). At this point, e−transfers from Li2CO3 to Au(111). Oxidation under UHV conditions thus initiate from the Au/Li2CO3 interface. The redox reaction pins Ve, which ceases to increase with another Li removal (Table 2). This is reminiscent of “Fermi level pinning” at metal-semiconductor interfaces by surface/defect states,54 except that in LIB the “defects” are mobile Li+ vacancies, not static impurities, and their density can be much higher. When 6 Li vacancies are created at the interface, Ve increases again. This may due to the complete removal of e−from some surface states. Unlike Li3PO4, the interfacial layer of Li2CO3 starts to lose structural integrity with removal of multiple Li+ (Fig. 7c). Removing one Li from the middle of the Li2CO3 slab (the hole remains on the Au sur- face) is less favorable by 0.25 eV compared to removing Li+ at the Au/carbonate interface. Removing a Li+ on the vacuum surface (Fig. 7d) is less favorable by another 0.22 eV, and Ve=4.50 V, much higher than the most energetically favorable Li+ vacancy at the interior Au(111) interface. These conﬁgurations reveal an inhomogeneity in the energy landscape perpendicular to the interface that may strongly aﬀect Li+ transport31 – especially if Li+ has to escape from the interior interface to the outer carbonate surface to the liquid electrolyte. D. Au/Li2CO3/EC/vacuum (Fig. 3c)for summary Next we use this Li2CO3 example to illustrate the impact of including explicit molecules in the theoretical models.

The DOS of Fig. 8b may superﬁcially seem to suggest Li2CO3 oxidation can occur at a very low Ve=2.31 V. However, Ve predicted with no Li vacancy is already lower than Vi computed for removing one Li. The correct interpretation of the ﬁrst 3 columns of Table 3 is that the Li content needs to increase in the direction of Ve until all Li-sites are occupied (Sec. II). It is inconsistent for (Li+,e−) pairs to be removed from the stoichiometric Li2CO3 slab when Ve=2.31 V. Therefore no oxidation occurs. So far we have considered uncharged electrodes. If a liquid electrolyte is present, net sur- face charges can be compensated by mobile ions in the liquid electric double layer (Fig. 1g). Fig. 7f and 8c represent a charged interface after replacing an EC molecule with a PF− 6 .93 The simulation cell remains charge neutral, and the −|e| charge must be largely compen- sated by a net positive charge on the Au(111) surface. This sets up an additional dipole moment, which increases Φ (Eq. 4). As a result, Ve rises to 3.53 V, very close to Vi under these conditions (Table 3). The DOS (Fig. 8c) shows that, while the PF− 6 valence band remains well below EF, some Li2CO3 orbitals on the outer surface has been raised almost to the Fermi level due to the close proximity of the anion.

Whether thin ﬁlm-coated electrodes exhibit net charges compensated by counterions in the liquid (Fig. 1g), or whether the voltage increase can be accommodated entirely by changes in Li+ conﬁgurations in the solid region (Fig. 1f), depends on which option minimizes the Gibbs free energy.

LixMn2O4, like most transition metal oxides, does not have a readily-deﬁned EF. In this work, EF is made unambiguous by putting a thin, reconstructed34 LMO (111) slab on a Au (111) “current collector” (Fig. 2c). Removing an e−from the system, without removing an accompanying Li+, does not immediately lead to a change in any Mn ion charge state, strongly suggesting that the e−is removed from the Fermi level straddling Au orbitals (not shown). This conﬁrms that EF is relevant for voltage estimate via Eq. 1. Allowing geometry optimization after e−removal yields a localized hole polaron which is now in equilibrium with EF. In contrast to Li2CO3 and Li3PO4, successive removal of Li+/e−pairs from the stoichio- metric LMO slab occur most favorably from the outer surface (Fig. 9a, see also the S.I.), not the LMO/Au interface. A Mn(III) turns into a Mn(IV) to accompany each e−removal. Table 4 indicates that the voltage increases with decreasing surface Li content, and Ve=Vi is achieved at ∆N(Li)=−2 under UHV conditions. Next we add EC to the LMO surface. If the system were a liquid-solid interface, the surface Li content, net surface charge, and surface density of EC molecules which directly coordinate to available Li ions should be self-consistently deduced using AIMD simulations at ﬁnite temperature.90 Here we conﬁne ourselves to T = 0 K and to adding one EC, yielding the surface used in Ref. 17. ∆N(Li)=-4 in this model (Fig. 9b), and Ve=4.23 V, in reasonably agreement with Vi=4.19 V for this conﬁguration (Table 4).

See Fig. 2 caption for color key. It is also important to elucidate the EDL structure of a charged, polaron-conducting LMO surface, not considered previously.17 As in the Li2CO3 example, we impose a positive charge by optimizing the geometry of a PF− 6 anion on the LMO surface in the overal charge- neutral simulation cell (Fig. 9c). The DOS (Fig. 10c) reveals that PF− 6 retains its excess electron and is not oxidized.93 A net +|e| compensating charge is found in the LMO slab, on a second layer Mn ion (“Mn 14”) below the LMO/vacuum interface. This layer contains Mn(II) ions, exchanged with Li+ in the Persson group’s reconstruction,34 which may be the reason a Mn(III) ion there can lose an e−most readily. The dipole moment created by the Mn(IV)-PF− 6 charge separation raises Ve dramatically, from 4.25 V to 6.41 V. Comparing the DOS with (Fig. 10b) and without (Fig. 10c) the PF− 6 , an occupied d-orbital on “Mn 14” is indeed seen to be depopulated; its orbital energy level now moves above EF. The EDL in this redox-active material now resembles Fig. 1h.

EC decomposition on LiMn2O4/Au surface Finally, we re-examine EC decomposition on the ∆N(Li)=−4 LMO slab, now with Au(111) present. Fig. 9d depicts a partially decomposed EC molecule on this LMO sur- face. A H+ is transferred to the LMO slab without breaking any C-O bond in the EC. Its energy is +0.35 eV above the intact EC conﬁguration (Fig. 9b), in good agreement with that of the reaction intermediate depicted in Fig. 5c of Ref. 17 where the Au slab was absent. A subsequent, C-O bond-breaking step is needed to render EC oxidation favorable.17 Examining the spin states reveals that a Mn(IV) ion (“Mn 16”) immediately below the oxide surface gains an e−to become a Mn(III). Consistent with this analysis, the DOS shows an unoccupied Mn d-orbital (Fig. 10b for intact EC) becoming occupied (Fig. 10d for broken EC), moving from above EF to below it due to polaronic relaxation.94 Some orbitals on the decomposed EC fragment reside near EF, suggesting further oxidation can readily occur. Regardless of whether an e−is added to LMO from an oxidized EC, or is removed by imposing a +|e| charge due to a counter-anion nearby, only Mn redox states change. Charge localization on Mn ions, accompanied by polaronic relaxation and a compensating PF− 6 or EC+ fragment nearby, ensures that e−and hole never access the Fermi level which lies on Au orbitals (Fig. 10). The Au current collector only serves to establish EF, with which polaron formation in LMO must remain in equilibrium. Therefore the eﬀect of the applied voltage is indirect. Increasing Vi and Ve consistently requires the loss of surface Li+ (Table 4), which leaves the surface with more oxygen ions that are under-coordinated, and increases its reactivity towards EC molecules. Adsorbed PF− 6 ions also increases the voltage. Since Vi controls the Li content at equilibrium in this voltage range (Li-sites are not fully depopulated yet), one can arguably ignore both the Au slab and Ve while performing simulations of parasitic reaction on such redox-active surfaces.16,17 As discussed above, the same reaction intermediate energetics is predicted with or without the", "page": 22, "position": 0}

The structures of electric double layers (EDL), and the atomic lengthscale manifestations of voltages, become much more complex than on pristine noble metal electrodes. This work considers Au(111) slabs coated with Li-conducting solid electrolytes or cathode oxide materials under ultra high vacuum (UHV) conditions. The applied voltage is shown to be strongly correlated with the surface dipole density at the interface, reminiscent of pho- tovoltaics studies. In relatively electrochemically inert thin ﬁlms like Li3PO4 and Li2CO3 coated on Au(111), dipole moments responsible for voltage increase are established by cre- ating negatively charged Li+ vacancies at the interface between cathode surfaces and the thin solid ﬁlms, compensated with positive charges on the cathode. The phosphate example highlights the crucial role of dipole density. The carbonate case emphasizes that organic solvent molecules like ethylene carbonate (EC) can dramatically modify the predicted volt- age even in the absence of charged species (salt). A corollary is that the Poisson-Boltzmann theory for liquid electrolytes, which ignores solvent dipole moments, may not quantitatively describe battery interfaces. With LixMn2O4 (LMO) cathode oxide thin ﬁlms coated on Au current collectors, charge transfer occurs at the outer LMO surface and involves changes in Mn redox states. The Au slab only indirectly determines the surface Li content and the anion surface density. Modeling of electrolyte decomposition on such electrode surfaces arguably does not require explicitly including the current collector. However, the voltage-dependent surface density of PF− 6 creates inhomogeneities and hot spots where fast electrolyte decomposition can occur. We also critically examine the deﬁnitions of “applied voltage” in DFT calculations at interfaces. We distinguish two voltages: electronic (Ve), due to electronic motion, and ionic (Vi), due to Li+ redistribution. In any atomic conﬁguration, Ve is well deﬁned in a metallic electrode and should coincide with the experimental voltage imposed via a potentiostat. Vi is a self-consistency critierion. At equilibrium, the system is pinned by Li+ insertion redox reactions, and Ve=Vi. It can be eﬃciently computed using the “lithium metal cohesive energy” method widely used in the battery theoretical literature, although most previous work", "page": 24, "position": 0}

Phys. 2009, 11, 9884-9897. 92 Eq. 4 implies that a small, −0.01 |e|/˚ A interfacial dipole density is suﬃcient to reduce the voltage by 1.8 V. 93 Most monatomic anions like Cl−would lose an e−to the electrode under UHV conditions. Fortunately, the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of PF− 6 lies far below the Fermi level in all cases and permit this strictly illustrative test. 94 Transferring one e−to the LMO surface does change Ve due to the small lateral surface area of the simulation cell. In the limiting case of one EC decomposition on an inﬁnite LMO surface, such voltage changes should be minimal. We also note that the ∆N(Li)=−4 voltage of ∼4.2 V should in reality induce some loss of Li from the bulk LMO regions. This eﬀect has been omitted in Ref. 17 for simplicity; it should make EC decomposition occur even more readily because it will produce more Mn(IV) ions in the near-surface region. 95 Otani, M.; Hamada, I.; Sugino, O.; Morikawa, Y.; Okamoto, Y.; Ikeshoji, T.
